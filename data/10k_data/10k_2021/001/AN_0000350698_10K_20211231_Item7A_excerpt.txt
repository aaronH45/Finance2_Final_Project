ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

We have market risk exposure on various instruments that are based on variable interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt, when appropriate, based on market conditions. 

We had $1.5 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payable at December 31, 2021, and $2.8 billion at December 31, 2020. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $14.6 million in 2021 and $27.6 million in 2020 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturersâ€™ floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates.

We had $340.0 million of commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2021. Based on the amount outstanding, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to our annual interest expense of $3.4 million in 2021. We had no commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2020.

Our fixed rate long-term debt, consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and finance lease and other debt obligations, totaled $2.9 billion and had a fair value of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2021, and totaled $2.1 billion and had a fair value of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2020.
