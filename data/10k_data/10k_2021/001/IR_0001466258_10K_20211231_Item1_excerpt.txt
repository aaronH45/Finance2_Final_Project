PART I

Item 1. BUSINESS

Overview

Trane Technologies, public limited company (plc), incorporated in Ireland in 2009, and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively we, our, the Company) is a global climate innovator. We bring sustainable and efficient solutions to buildings, homes and transportation through our strategic brands, Trane® and Thermo King®, and our environmentally responsible portfolio of products, services and connected intelligent controls. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sales and service of solutions for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and transport refrigeration. As an industry leader with an extensive global install base, our growth strategy includes expanding recurring revenue through services and rental options. Our unique business operating system, uplifting culture and highly engaged team around the world are also central to our earnings and cash flow growth.

Through our sustainability-focused strategy and purpose to boldly challenge what’s possible for a sustainable world, we meet critical needs and growing global demand for innovation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions while enabling healthier, efficient indoor environments and safe, reliable delivery of essential temperature-controlled cargo. We have announced certain defined sustainability commitments with a goal of achieving these commitments by 2030 (2030 Sustainability Commitments). Trane Technologies’ bold 2030 Sustainability Commitments have been verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and include our ‘Gigaton Challenge’ to reduce customer greenhouse gas emissions by a billion metric tons, ‘Leading by Example’ through carbon-neutral operations across our own footprint, and ‘Opportunity for All’ by building a diverse workforce reflective of our communities. 

Reportable Segments

We have three regional operating segments which are also our reportable segments. 

•Our Americas segment innovates for customers in North America and Latin America. The Americas segment encompasses commercial heating and cooling systems, building controls, and energy services and solutions; residential heating and cooling; and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. This segment had 2021 net revenues of $11.0 billion.

•Our EMEA segment innovates for customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The EMEA segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and industrial processing, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. This segment had 2021 net revenues of $1.9 billion.

•Our Asia Pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. This segment had 2021 net revenues of $1.2 billion.

Products and Services

Our principal products and services include the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

These products are sold primarily under our tradenames including Trane® and Thermo King®. 

Competitive Conditions

Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services. They include well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger U.S. and non-U.S. corporations or divisions of larger companies.

The principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price, quality, delivery, service and support, technology and innovation. We are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of HVAC systems and services and transport temperature control products and services.

Distribution

Our products are distributed by a number of methods, which we believe are appropriate to the type of product. U.S. sales are made through branch sales offices, distributors and dealers across the country. Non-U.S. sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world.

Operations by Geographic Area

Approximately 29% of our net revenues in 2021 were derived outside the U.S. and we sold products in approximately 100 countries. Therefore, the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country, such as currency devaluation, nationalization and establishment of common markets, may have an adverse impact on our non-U.S. operations. 

5
Customers

We have no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019. No material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers; therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.

Raw Materials

We manufacture many of the components included in our products, which requires us to source a wide variety of commodities. Principal commodities, such as steel, copper and aluminum, are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world, primarily within the region where the products are manufactured. We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future. 

Seasonality

Demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions. For instance, sales in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses historically tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere markets, which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. Therefore, results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations.

Research and Development

We engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products, enhance existing product effectiveness, improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate. In 2021, we spent $193.5 million on research and development, focused on product and system sustainability improvements such as increasing energy efficiency, developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants, reducing material content in products, and designing products for circularity. All new product development (NPD) programs must complete a Design for Sustainability module within our NPD process to ensure that every program has a positive impact on sustainability.

We also have a strong focus on sustaining activities, which include costs incurred to reduce production costs, improve existing products, create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development and sustaining activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position. 

Patents and Licenses

Our intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes, and other confidential information. Although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. In our opinion, engineering, production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our intellectual property rights.

Backlog

Our backlog of orders, believed to be firm, at December 31, was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

These backlog figures are based on orders received and only include amounts associated with our equipment and contracting and installation performance obligations. A major portion of our residential products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock. As a result, we expect to ship a majority of the December 31, 2021 backlog during 2022. However, orders for specialized machinery or specific customer applications are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral, and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced significant increases in end market demand for our sustainability-focused products and services resulting in a higher backlog of orders in the current year as compared to prior year. In addition, we are seeing industry-wide supply chain and resource constraints impacting our ability to produce and ship product which we are proactively managing. To the extent projects are delayed or there are additional supply chain and resource constraints, the timing of our revenue could be affected.

Environmental Matters

We continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources, and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities and off-site waste disposal facilities.

It is our policy to establish environmental reserves for investigation and remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. Estimated liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown environmental conditions, changes in government laws and regulations, and changes in cleanup technologies. The environmental reserves are updated on a routine basis as remediation efforts progress and new information becomes available.  

We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state and international authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. In most instances at multi-party sites, our share of the liability is not material.

In estimating our liability at multi-party sites, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. 

For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Separation of Industrial Segment Businesses

On February 29, 2020 (Distribution Date), we completed our Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction) with Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc. (Gardner Denver, which changed its name to Ingersoll Rand Inc. (Ingersoll Rand) after the Transaction) whereby we distributed Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc., which contained our former Industrial segment (Ingersoll Rand Industrial) through a pro rata distribution (the Distribution) to shareholders of record as of February 24, 2020. Ingersoll Rand Industrial then merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. Upon close of the Transaction, our existing shareholders received 50.1% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Gardner Denver stockholders retained 49.9% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand on a fully diluted basis. As a result, our shareholders received .8824 shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock with respect to each share owned as of February 24, 2020. In connection with the Transaction, we received a special cash payment of $1.9 billion. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid Ingersoll Rand $49.5 million to settle certain items related to the Transaction. This payment was related to working capital, cash and indebtedness amounts as of the Distribution Date, as well as funding levels related to pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits. We recorded the settlement as a reduction to Retained earnings during the first quarter of 2021. 

After the Distribution Date, we do not beneficially own any Ingersoll Rand Industrial shares of common stock and no longer consolidate Ingersoll Rand Industrial in our financial statements. The historical results of Ingersoll Rand Industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. 

Asbestos-Related Matters

On June 18, 2020 (Petition Date), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Aldrich and Murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte (the Bankruptcy Court). As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Inc. (200 Park), Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs LLC (ClimateLabs), Trane Technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries (the Trane Companies) are part of the Chapter 11 filings.

The goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures.

On September 24, 2021, Aldrich and Murray filed the plan of reorganization (the Plan) with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan is supported by, and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the court-appointed legal representative of future asbestos claimants (the FCR). In connection with the Plan, Aldrich and Murray filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to create a $270.0 million trust intended to constitute a "qualified settlement fund" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code (QSF). The funds held in the QSF would be available to provide funding for the Section 524(g) Trust upon effectiveness of the Plan. 

On January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF. The QSF is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. At this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last. The Chapter 11 cases remain pending as of February 7, 2022.

Prior to the Petition Date, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of our existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos.

Human Capital Management

Our people and culture are critical to achieving our operational, financial and strategic success. 

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 37,000 people in nearly 60 countries including approximately 13,000 outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2021, 25.5% of our global employees were women and 36.4% of our employees in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. In 2021, 29.2% of our new hires globally were women and 44.2% of new hires in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. Approximately 23.1% of leadership and management positions were held by women as of December 31, 2021. The diversity amounts included in this section exclude current year business acquisitions.

As a result of maintaining a consistent focus on an uplifting culture, our key talent (high performing and high potential salaried employees) retention rate excluding retirements in 2021 was 94.6%. Our company‑wide (all employees) voluntary retention rate excluding retirements was 89.5%.

Culture and Purpose

In 2021, we continued to execute on our purpose to boldly challenge what’s possible for a sustainable world. We are a diverse team of inventive, collaborative people who share a passion for making a difference and we believe our core Leadership Principles will help guide all employees to live our purpose.

Since its launch in 2006, our annual employee engagement survey has enabled employees to share their experiences and perceptions of our Company. Employees provided ratings and written comments for continuous improvement. In 2021, 89% of our workforce participated in our annual engagement survey and our overall employee engagement score remains high reflecting our great commitment to the pride, energy and optimism of our employees.

Diversity and Inclusion

Our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion is core to our purpose and our 2030 Sustainability Commitments. We are proud members of Paradigm for Parity (a coalition of more than 100 corporations who have committed to closing the gender gap in corporate leadership) and OneTen (a coalition dedicated to hiring one million Black Americans in the next ten years to achieve economic mobility). In addition, we are a 2017 signatory, renewed by Dave Regnery in 2021, to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge (the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace).

We offer company-sponsored forums to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace including:

•Bridging Connections – a safe forum created to allow our employees to speak from the heart about a variety of topics without fear of retribution.

•Employee Resources Groups (ERGs) – we sponsor eight ERGs (the Women's Employee Network, the Black Employee Network, the Veterans Employee Resource Group, the Asian Employee Resource Group, the Global Organization of Latinos, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Allies (LGBTA) Employee Resource Group, the InterGenerational Employee Network, and Visibility). All ERGs are voluntary, open and inclusive organizations that offer employees a sense of belonging, networking and learning opportunities. 

•Women’s Leadership Development Programs

◦The Women in Action Leadership Program is a virtual, self-paced cohort program that provides women with access to content that promotes their leadership development skills. 

◦The Women on the Rise (WOR) program is designed over eight-weeks to help empower, develop, connect and support emerging women leaders.

◦The Women’s Leadership Program (WLP) is a cohort program for high potential talent that provides an opportunity to network with other senior women leaders, gain individual insights through an executive mentoring partnership and build leadership skills and confidence through a variety of learning components, speakers, experiences and assessments.

•In 2021, we launched The Elevate Series which encompasses the belonging and advancement of the racial and ethnically diverse leaders in our company. This is an extension of the Black Leader Forum in 2019 which was an intensive day and a half session bringing together company leaders to learn, deepen a sense of community and build upon our strategic intent to advance Black leaders.

Learning and Development

We offer learning and career development opportunities that enhance our employees’ skills and abilities and ensure contemporary technical and functional skills and competencies such as innovation, collaboration and leadership. Examples of these programs include: 

•Team Leader Development Program – An eight-week experiential development program that engages, teaches and empowers front-line plant leaders to apply continuous improvement methods, make sound business decisions, solve problems, and serve as a coach of direct workers.

•Graduate Training Program (GTP) – A five-month development program designed to prepare university graduate engineers for a rewarding career in technical sales. The program prepares sales engineers to sell Trane’s complex HVAC systems and energy services. The program, started in 1926, is recognized as the industry’s most comprehensive training program and provides intensive technical, business, sales, and leadership training. GTP accelerates careers and provides the skills needed to help us to seek to lower the energy intensity of the world.

•Accelerated Development Program (ADP) – An early career rotational program focused on both functional and leadership development, designed to build a pipeline of strong talent for key roles in the organization. Participants rotate to multiple geographic locations and business units during the 2.5 year program, while completing diverse assignments, and receiving dedicated functional training and developmental experiences. Established in 1979, the ADP holds a rich history of developing early talent and spans six functions and four regions.

•Leadership Development - We invest in custom, key transition leadership development programs for our high potential talent from immersive experiential leader acceleration labs to innovative global cohort programs. We partner with best-in-class external leadership development experts such as INSEAD, Center for Creative Leadership, and the NeuroLeadership Institute to deliver these programs globally each year. Additionally, we offer to our Trane Technologies people leaders learning programs to develop their skills in leading their teams, such as building diverse and inclusive teams, increasing engagement, and coaching skills.

•Professional development – We have numerous online courses in professional development skills as varied as working virtually, resiliency, Microsoft Teams, unconscious bias, effective communication, alert driving, sustainability, and strategic capability initiatives such as product management and other programs that support our strategy of being a world class lean enterprise.

•Compliance Training – Our Compliance Training curriculum covers key topics that are important to protect our Company, our people and our customers. Topics include certification in our Code of Conduct, Information Security, Understanding and Preventing Sexual Harassment and Human Trafficking Prevention. All salaried employees globally complete our annual compliance curriculum.

Employee Volunteerism

In 2021, due to the ongoing challenges connected to the COVID-19 global pandemic, our employees sought out creative alternatives to in-person volunteering, including coordinated virtual volunteering events, and digital mentoring. One of the year’s highlights was our support of a dynamic multi-state exhibition called Creators Wanted, that introduced thousands of junior and senior high school students in multiple U.S. states to the rewarding career pathways available in manufacturing. Our teams volunteered hundreds of hours, partnering with the National Association of Manufacturers, producing a unique and lasting experience. 

Last year, we introduced a new Global Volunteer Time program to support salaried employees with a full eight-hour workday per calendar year to volunteer their time with eligible non-profit organizations. This program was made available for hourly employees at select locations. Through the Volunteer Time Off program and individual acts of volunteerism, our generous employees around the world contributed more than 10,000 hours of volunteerism in 2021. Our support for those in need also included our own colleagues support for one another. Due to the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an unforeseen weather event in our plant in Tyler, Texas, Trane Technologies employees and the Trane Technologies Foundation donated grants to employees facing extraordinary hardship through our Helping Hand Fund. These grants totaled approximately $0.6 million, providing approximately 400 employees with critical support for themselves and their families.

Health, Safety and Well-Being

Trane Technologies believes in supporting the total health and safety of our employees. It is even more critical given the impact of COVID-19, and we continue to provide expanded support by:

•Providing 100% of our employees around the world access to at least one company-sponsored wellness activity, including implementing a holistic wellness engagement platform globally to support personal needs of employees and to provide mental health support resources.

•Initiating a global workstream to assess mental health, to identify areas of concerns and to implement programs and provide resources to support individuals’ mental health needs. Global ERGs sponsored mental health education sessions, which included raising awareness of mental health risks and patient health questionnaire (PHQ) assessment methods. Through our global Employee Assistance Program, employees received frequent communications on resources, targeted to crisis concerns such as mental health, childcare, and education.

•Accelerating our “Future of Work” initiative to create revised Flex Time and Flex Place policies and resources that vary by type of role, continued work-from-home arrangements, and other approaches to ensuring productivity while being supportive to employee needs.

•Providing global employees with up to 4 hours of paid time off per vaccine or booster dose to support and encourage all employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19.

•Facilitating the delivery of critical medical resources, including oxygen, to support employees in locations where essential supplies were in shortage.

In 2021 we continued our multi-year, world class safety record with a Lost-time Incident Rate below 0.10 and Recordable Rate below 1.00. In response to the pandemic, we continue to monitor, track and implement COVID-19 guidance based on World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other local or country specific guidelines. We internally track the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and keep close contact with those who quarantine. We compare these numbers to local community infection rates where available. In our factories, we reconfigured over 5,000 workstations to meet the social distancing guidelines. We also completed over 40,000 observations of our service technicians and manufacturing employees to ensure all employees were following our COVID-19 protocols.

Competitive Pay and Benefits

Trane Technologies’ compensation programs and policies are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and strategy: to attract and retain a talented workforce and to meet the needs of employees globally. We are committed to providing competitive and equitable wages and benefits that will allow our employees to thrive at work and at home. In addition, the structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both long-term and short-term performance, with our annual incentive plan closely tied to our 2030 sustainability commitments, which includes environmental sustainability and workforce diversity goals, in addition to financial goals.

Trane Technologies’ benefits programs and policies are designed to support the wellbeing of employees so they can thrive at work and at home. Purpose-driven and locally relevant benefits programs are provided globally. In addition to core and competitive medical, welfare and retirement programs, benefit offerings include programs to support work-life balance, including:

•Expanded family support programs inclusive of child and elder back-up care programs;

•Enhanced parental leave programs; and 

•Tuition reimbursement to support the ongoing growth and development of our employees.

Our proxy statement provides more detail on the competitive compensation and benefit programs we offer.
