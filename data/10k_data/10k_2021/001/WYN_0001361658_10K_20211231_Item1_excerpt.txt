History and Development

Our corporate history can be traced back to the formation of Hospitality Franchise Systems (“HFS”) in 1990. In December 1997, HFS merged with CUC International, Inc. to form Cendant Corporation, which then expanded further through the addition of vacation rentals and vacation ownership businesses. On July 31, 2006, Cendant distributed all of the shares of its subsidiary, Wyndham Worldwide Corporation (“Wyndham Worldwide”), to the holders of Cendant common stock. On August 1, 2006, we commenced “regular way” trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol WYN.

On May 31, 2018, we established Wyndham Destinations, Inc. and completed the spin-off of our hotel business (“Spin-off”) into a separate publicly traded company, Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, Inc. (“Wyndham Hotels”). This transaction was effected through a pro rata distribution of the new hotel entity’s stock to shareholders of Wyndham Worldwide (the “Distribution”). In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into certain agreements with Wyndham Hotels. See “Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off” for more information. The two public companies have also entered into long-term exclusive license agreements to retain their affiliations with one of the industry’s top-rated loyalty programs, Wyndham Rewards, as well as to continue to collaborate on inventory-sharing and customer cross-selling initiatives.

On January 5, 2021, we acquired the Travel + Leisure brand and all related assets from Meredith Corporation (“Meredith”). The acquisition created a strategic alliance between Travel + Leisure Co. and Meredith, with Meredith continuing to operate and monetize Travel + Leisure branded multi-platform media assets across multiple channels under a 30-year royalty-free, renewable licensing relationship. In connection with this acquisition, on February 17, 2021, Wyndham Destinations, Inc. was renamed Travel + Leisure Co. and continues to trade on the NYSE under the new ticker symbol TNL. See Note 5—Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Business Strategy

We are primarily focused on leisure travel and our mission is to “Put the World on Vacation.” Travel + Leisure Co. has been a leader in the travel membership business for over 50 years. Our strategy is to accelerate growth of our global businesses by broadening the strength of our cornerstone timeshare and exchange businesses and creating depth of leisure travel products and services through our business extensions, Panorama Travel Solutions and the Travel + Leisure Group.

BUSINESS DESCRIPTIONS 

We report results of operations for our three umbrella business lines in the following financial reporting segments, which are described in more detail below:

•Vacation Ownership, comprised of Wyndham Destinations.

•Travel and Membership, comprised of Panorama and the Travel + Leisure Group.

Our business segments generate diversified revenue streams and significant cash flow. Prior to COVID-19, we generated 46% of our revenues from the sale of vacation ownership interests, and 40% of our revenues from our Fee-for-Service businesses. This split was 23% and 53% in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, partially recovering to 38% and 48% in 2021.

Our businesses have both domestic and international operations. During 2021, we derived 88% of our revenues in the United States (“U.S.”) and 12% internationally. For further details on our segment revenues, profits, assets and geographical operations, see Note 24—Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

VACATION OWNERSHIP

Industry

The vacation ownership industry, also referred to as the timeshare industry, enables consumers to share ownership of fully-furnished vacation accommodations. Typically, the consumer purchases either a title to a fraction of a unit through a points-based system or a right to use a property for a specific period of time through a weekly interval system. This is referred to as a vacation ownership interest (“VOI”). Under a points-based system, owners often have advance reservation rights for a particular destination, and are free to redeem their points for various unit types and/or locations. In addition, points-owners can vary the length and frequency of product utilization. 

According to a 2021 report issued by the American Resort Development Association, domestic vacation ownership sales were $4.9 billion during 2020. The pandemic impacted key industry performance measures in 2020 and industry sales decreased for 

4
the first time in more than a decade. In 2019, domestic vacation ownership interest sales were $10.5 billion and in 2018, industry sales were $10.2 billion.

Typically, developers sell VOIs for a fixed purchase price that is paid in full at closing or financed through developer-offered financing options. Vacation ownership resorts are often operated by a property owners’ association of which the VOI owners are members. Most property owners’ associations are governed by a board of directors that includes owners and which may include representatives of the developer. The board of the property owners’ association typically delegates much of the responsibility for managing the resort to a management company, which is often affiliated with the developer.

After the initial purchase, most vacation ownership programs require the owner to pay an annual maintenance fee. This fee represents the owner’s allocable share of the costs and expenses of operating and maintaining the vacation ownership property and providing program services. This fee typically covers expenses such as housekeeping, landscaping, taxes, insurance, resort labor, a management fee payable to the management company, and an assessment to fund a reserve account used to renovate, refurbish and replace furnishings, appliances, common areas and other assets, such as structural elements and equipment, as needed over time. 

Based on published industry data, owners express the following primary reasons for buying and continuing to own their timeshare: 

•saving money on future vacation costs;

•location of resorts;

•overall flexibility to use different locations, unit types, and times of year;

•certainty of vacations; and

•certainty of quality accommodations. 

Vacation Ownership Overview

Our Vacation Ownership reportable segment is comprised of our Wyndham Destinations branded business line, which is the world’s largest vacation ownership business. We develop and acquire vacation ownership resorts, market and sell VOIs, provide consumer financing for the majority of the sales, and provide property management services to property owners’ associations. As of December 31, 2021, we had more than 245 vacation ownership resorts in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Caribbean, and Asia Pacific that represent over 26,000 individual vacation ownership units and 833,000 owners of VOIs. Our programs allow us to market and sell our vacation ownership products in variable quantities and to offer existing owners “upgrade” sales to supplement their existing VOIs.

Strategies 

Our goal is to strengthen our leadership position in the vacation ownership industry and generate consistent and long-term value for our shareholders. To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies:

Optimize the revenue potential of our existing owner base as well as enhance our upgrade pipeline through the addition of new owners. We have strong embedded revenue potential through our existing owner base: owners upgrade as vacation needs evolve. We earn interest revenue on our portfolio as well as club and resort management fees. We also seek to enhance our future upgrade pipeline through sales to new owners. On average, new owners double their initial VOI purchase within six years, resulting in predictable, high-margin future revenue streams. 

Maximize our relationship with Wyndham Hotels. We have a long-term, exclusive license agreement and marketing arrangements with Wyndham Hotels, the world’s largest hotel franchiser with approximately 9,000 affiliated hotels located in approximately 95 countries. The Wyndham loyalty program, Wyndham Rewards, has over 92 million enrolled members, many of whom fit our target new-customer demographic, providing us with a substantial customer sourcing opportunity to drive future VOI sales. We plan to increase this sales channel with initiatives such as enhanced call transfers, online marketing, in-hotel marketing, and online rentals of vacation ownership resorts. Volume per guest on affinity marketing tours is higher than other tours, helping to increase margins on new owner sales. 

Add leisure or hospitality brands to our existing portfolio. The addition of brands will help us expand in existing markets or extend into new markets. New brands will also help with lead generation for new owner tours.

Maintain a capital-efficient inventory sourcing strategy to produce attractive returns and cash flow. We have a diverse inventory sourcing model, including self-developed inventory, Just-in-Time inventory, Fee-for-Service inventory, consumer 

5
loan defaults, and inventory reclaimed from owners’ associations or owners that allow us to generate VOI sales. Our capital-efficient inventory sourcing strategy has significantly increased return on invested capital since 2010. 

Revenues and Operating Statistics

Our vacation ownership business derives a majority of its revenues from timeshare sales, with the remainder of revenues coming from consumer financing and property management fees.

Performance in our vacation ownership business is measured by the following key operating statistics:

•Gross vacation ownership interest sales — Sales of VOIs including Fee-for-Service sales, before the effect of loan loss provisions.

•Tours — Number of tours taken by guests in our efforts to sell VOIs.

•Volume per guest (“VPG”) — Gross VOI sales (excluding tele-sales upgrades, which are non-tour upgrade sales) divided by the number of tours. We have excluded non-tour upgrade sales in the calculation of VPG because they are generated by a different marketing channel.

Sales and Marketing

We employ a variety of marketing channels to encourage prospective owners of VOIs to tour our properties and attend sales presentations at our resort-based sales centers as well as off-site sales offices. Our resort-based sales centers also enable us to actively solicit upgrade sales to existing owners of VOIs while they vacation at our resorts. We operate a tele-sales program designed to market upgrade sales to existing owners of our products. In total VOI upgrade sales represented 72% and 73% of our net VOI sales in 2021 and 2020.

Our marketing and sales activities are often facilitated through marketing alliances with other travel, hospitality, entertainment, gaming, and retail companies that provide access to such companies’ customers through a variety of co-branded marketing offers. Our resort-based sales centers, which are located in popular travel destinations throughout the U.S., generate substantial tour flow by enabling us to market to tourists already visiting these destinations. Our marketing agents, who often operate on the premises of the hospitality, entertainment, gaming, and retail companies with which we have alliances, solicit tourists with offers relating to entertainment activities and other incentives in exchange for the tourists visiting the local resorts and attending sales presentations.

Consumer Financing

We offer financing to purchasers of VOIs which attracts additional customers and generates substantial incremental revenues and profits. We fund and service loans through our wholly-owned consumer financing subsidiary, Wyndham Consumer Finance. Wyndham Consumer Finance performs loan financing, servicing, and related administrative functions. 

We typically perform a credit investigation or other inquiry into a purchaser’s credit history before offering to finance a portion of the purchase price of the VOI. The interest rate offered to participating purchasers is determined by an automated underwriting process based upon the purchaser’s credit score and the amount of the down payment. We use a consumer credit score, Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”), which is a branded version of a consumer credit score widely used within the U.S. Our weighted average FICO score on new originations was 736 and 735 for 2021 and 2020.

During 2021, we generated $780 million of receivables on $1.31 billion of gross VOI sales, net of Fee-for-Service sales, resulting in 60% of our VOI sales being financed. This level of financing is prior to the receipt of addenda cash. Addenda cash represents the cash received for full payment of a loan within 15 to 60 days of origination. After the application of addenda cash, we financed 53% of VOI sales during 2021.

We generally require a minimum down payment of 10% of the purchase price on all VOI sales and offer consumer financing for the remaining balance for up to 10 years. While the minimum down payment is generally 10%, our average down payment on financed VOI sales was 24% and 25% for 2021 and 2020. These loans are structured with equal monthly installments that fully amortize the principal by the final due date.

Similar to many other companies that provide consumer financing, we have historically securitized a majority of the receivables originated in connection with the sale of VOIs. We initially place the financed contracts into a revolving warehouse securitization facility, generally within 30 to 90 days after origination. Many of the receivables are subsequently transferred from the warehouse securitization facility into term securitization facilities.

6
Our consumer financing subsidiary is responsible for the maintenance of contract receivables files as well as all customer service, billing, and collection activities related to our domestic loans. We assess the performance of our loan portfolio by monitoring numerous metrics including collection rates, defaults by state of residency, and bankruptcies. Our consumer financing subsidiary also manages the selection and processing of loans pledged or to be pledged in our warehouse and term securitization facilities. As of December 31, 2021, 96% of our loan portfolio was current (not more than 30 days past due).

Property Management

On behalf of each of the property owners’ associations, we or our affiliates generally provide day-to-day management for vacation ownership resorts, which includes oversight of housekeeping services, maintenance, and refurbishment of the units, and provide certain accounting and administrative services to property owners’ associations. The terms of the property management agreements are generally between three to five years; however, the vast majority of the agreements provide a mechanism for automatic renewal upon expiration of the terms. In connection with these property management services, we receive fees which are generally based upon total costs to operate such resorts. Fees for property management services typically approximate 10% of budgeted operating expenses. As the owner of unsold VOIs, we pay maintenance fees in accordance with the legal requirements of the jurisdictions in which the resorts are located. In addition, at certain newly-developed resorts, we may enter into subsidy agreements with the property owners’ associations to cover costs that otherwise would be covered by annual maintenance fees payable with respect to VOIs that have not yet been sold.

Seasonality

We rely, in part, upon tour flow to generate sales of VOIs; consequently, sales volume tends to increase in the spring and summer months as a result of greater tour flow from travelers, generally resulting in higher revenue from sales of VOIs in the third quarter than in other quarters. Our seasonality has been and could continue to be impacted by COVID-19.

Competition

Our vacation ownership business principally competes with short-term vacation options such as lodging, cruise and home and apartment sharing services, as well as other timeshare developers. The leisure travel industry is large and highly competitive. We compete based on lifetime value, location, convenience, quality of accommodations, service levels, amenities, and flexibility. In order to compete, we incent potential new owners and existing owners to tour with us in order to better understand our products and services.

The vacation ownership industry has consolidated over the last 15 years leaving multiple well-capitalized, branded companies including: Marriott Vacations Worldwide, Hilton Grand Vacations, Disney Vacation Club, Holiday Inn Club Vacations, and Bluegreen Vacations. As an industry, we largely source potential new owner tours from different marketing channels, but there is overlap when consumers are members of more than one loyalty program and/or travel to more than one resort within a market. We compete for property acquisitions and partnerships with entities that have similar investment objectives. There is also significant competition for talent at all levels within the industry, in particular for sales and management. Competitors range from small, independent vacation ownership companies, to large branded hospitality companies, all operating vacation ownership businesses involved in the development, finance, and operation of timeshare properties. 

We generally do not face competition in our consumer financing business to finance our VOI sales. We do face competition from financial institutions providing other forms of consumer credit, which may lead to full or partial prepayment of our timeshare financing receivables. 

TRAVEL AND MEMBERSHIP

Travel and Membership Overview

Our Travel and Membership segment is comprised of our branded business lines, Panorama and the Travel + Leisure Group, which operate a variety of travel businesses, including three vacation ownership exchange brands, travel clubs, direct-to-consumer rentals, and a home exchange network. These businesses are primarily Fee-for-Service, selling third-party inventory that provides stable revenue streams and produces strong cash flow.

We operate RCI, the world’s largest vacation exchange network based on the number of members and affiliated resorts. Through our collection of vacation exchange brands, we have 3.7 million paid member families. Annual member retention is high and over the last three years we have retained on average 84% of the exchange memberships through our RCI, 7Across, and Love Home Swap networks. In the vast majority of cases, we acquire new members when an affiliated timeshare developer pays for the initial term of a membership on behalf of a timeshare owner as part of the vacation ownership purchase process. Generally, this initial membership is for either a one or two year term, after which these new members may choose to 

7
renew directly with us. We also acquire a small percentage of new members directly from online channels or direct consumer outreach. Members receive periodicals and other communications published by us and, for additional fees, may use the vacation exchange program and other services that provide the ability to protect trading power or points, extend the life of a deposit, and combine two or more deposits for the opportunity to exchange into intervals with higher trading power and book travel services.

Our vacation exchange business has relationships with 4,200 affiliated vacation ownership resorts in approximately 110 countries and territories located in North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific.

Panorama Travel Solutions offers global discount travel membership clubs and custom travel technology solutions to business-to-business affinity partners including large employers, banks and retailers, trade associations and others via their operations in the U.S., Mexico, Asia, and Europe. Our travel technology platforms are powered by Alliance Reservations Network, a Panorama company, which has been operating travel booking technology since 1995. Members are acquired through affinity partnerships where the affinity partner would offer a travel club membership to affiliated groups, usually its customers, members and/or employees.

Following our acquisition of the Travel + Leisure brand, we established the Travel + Leisure Group to offer travelers a suite of products and services that bring the brand to life, including Travel + Leisure Club, a subscription travel club where members can dream, plan, book and go – all in one place. Subscribers have access to preferred pricing on featured itineraries inspired by editorial coverage, personalized concierge service, extra savings on more than a million travel options, and exclusive experiences, along with a complimentary subscription to Travel + Leisure magazine. 

Strategies

Our goal is to grow our cornerstone vacation exchange business, optimize cash flow, and broaden our reach into the leisure travel markets to accelerate overall growth for the segment through our business extensions, Panorama Travel Solutions and the Travel + Leisure Group. To achieve this goal, we intend to pursue the following strategies:

Expand and enhance our products and services to increase wallet share, propensity, and retention within our member base. Through the addition of more inventory options for exchange and more travel products and services, Panorama seeks to enhance its core exchange business lines’ growth through greater share of consumers’ travel spend, increased member engagement, and reduced churn. 

Offer B2B travel club solutions. We seek to grow our membership beyond the timeshare industry, expanding B2B partnerships across multiple sectors driving incremental transaction revenue and subscriptions. We offer white-label solutions to associations, organizations, and other closed-user groups in order for these groups to offer travel benefits to their communities which increases engagement and loyalty. 

Grow our Direct-to-Consumer (“D2C”) travel club leveraging the Travel + Leisure brand and content. We plan to leverage Travel + Leisure, one of the world’s most influential travel brands, to expand our total addressable market and grow our subscription travel club by marketing to Travel + Leisure magazine subscribers and leisure travelers in general.

Revenues and Operating Statistics

Travel and Membership derives the majority of its revenues from annual membership dues and fees for facilitating exchange and non-exchange transactions and other travel accommodations and services. We also generate revenue from programs with affiliated resorts, club servicing, and loyalty programs, as well as additional products that provide exchange members with the ability to protect trading power or points, extend the life of deposits, and combine two or more deposits for the opportunity to exchange into intervals with higher trading power. No single customer, developer, or group accounts for more than 10% of our revenues. 

Performance in our Travel and Membership business has been measured by the following key operating statistics:

•Average number of exchange members — Represents paid members in our vacation exchange programs who are considered to be in good standing.

•Transactions — Represents the number of vacation bookings recognized as revenue during the period, net of cancellations.

•Revenue per transaction — Represents transactional revenue divided by transactions.

8
Sales and Marketing, Distribution and Customer Development

In the exchange business, we affiliate with vacation ownership developers directly through our in-house sales teams. Affiliated vacation ownership developers sign agreements that have an average duration of three years. Our vacation exchange members are acquired primarily through our affiliated developers as part of the vacation ownership purchase process. We acquire a small percentage of our members directly from online channels.

Panorama collaborates with affinity groups outside of the vacation ownership industry through our Panorama Travel Solutions business, which includes ARN. These affinity groups include employee benefit plans, professional associations, and other paid membership groups that are interested in providing travel benefits to their members to enhance customer loyalty, and in many cases, generate incremental fee streams. 

The Travel + Leisure Group develops relationships directly with consumers through quality travel content and by marketing to both Travel + Leisure magazine subscribers and leisure travelers in general. We distribute our products and services through proprietary websites and call centers around the world. Customers are acquired through direct channels, partnerships with affinity groups, and third party acquisition sources.

Inventory

The properties our business makes available to travelers include vacation ownership and fractional resorts, homes, private residence clubs, and traditional hotel rooms. Only in rare cases do we acquire and take title of inventory, as our network supply is predominantly owned and provided by third-party affiliates and suppliers. We offer travelers flexibility to select preferred travel dates in a variety of lodging options. We leverage inventory comprised of VOIs and independently owned properties across our network of brands to maximize value for affiliates and members.

Seasonality

Our revenues from vacation exchange fees have traditionally been higher in the first quarter, which is generally when our vacation exchange members plan and book their vacations for the year. Our seasonality has been and could continue to be impacted by COVID-19.

Competition

Our global exchange business competes with other vacation exchange companies, most notably Interval International, certain timeshare developers and clubs that offer vacation exchange through their own internal networks of properties. This business also competes with third-party internet travel intermediaries and peer-to-peer online networks that are used by consumers to search for and book their resort and other travel accommodations.

Our non-exchange Travel and Membership businesses compete more broadly with the larger sector of leisure travel options including traditional travel agents, online travel agents, and travel clubs.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our business is affected by our ability to protect against infringement of our intellectual property, including our trademarks, service marks, logos, trade names, domain names, and other proprietary rights. The foregoing segment descriptions specify the brands that are used by each of our segments. Travel + Leisure Co. and its subsidiaries actively use or license for use all significant marks and domain names, and we own or have exclusive licenses to use these marks and domain names. In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a license, development and noncompetition agreement with Wyndham Hotels, which, among other things, granted to Travel + Leisure Co. the right to use the “Wyndham” trademark, “The Registry Collection” trademark, and certain other trademarks and intellectual property in our business. See “Key Agreements Related to the Spin-Off—License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement” for more information. We register the marks that we own in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as well as with other relevant authorities where we deem appropriate, and seek to protect our marks from unauthorized use as permitted by law.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Our business is subject to various international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations, and policies in jurisdictions in which we operate. Some laws, regulations, and policies impact multiple areas of our business, such as securities, anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, data protection and security and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations under the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions 

9
generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or generating business. Other laws, regulations, and policies primarily affect one of our areas of business: inventory sourcing activities; sales and marketing activities; purchaser financing activities; and property management activities.

Timeshare Inventory Purchasing and Development

Our inventory sourcing activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium, and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations applicable to real estate development, subdivision, and construction activities, such as laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance, and taxation. In the U.S., these include the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Accessibility Guidelines promulgated thereunder. In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer.

Sales and Marketing Regulation

Our sales and marketing activities are highly regulated. In addition to regulations implementing laws enacted specifically for the timeshare industry, a wide variety of laws and regulations govern our sales and marketing activities, including regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, Foreign Investment In Real Property Tax Act, the Federal Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act and fair housing statutes, U.S. Federal Trade Commission and states’ “Little FTC Acts” and other regulations governing unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices including unfair or deceptive trade practices and unfair competition, state attorney general regulations, anti-fraud laws, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, laws governing discount sales and buying clubs, real estate, title agency or insurance and other licensing or registration laws and regulations, anti-money laundering, consumer information privacy and security, breach notification, information sharing, telemarketing and email marketing laws, home solicitation sales laws, tour operator laws, lodging certificate and seller of travel laws, securities laws, subscription laws, and other consumer protection laws.

We must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities for our sales and marketing activities. Changes in circumstances or applicable law may necessitate the application for or modification of existing approvals. Our telemarketing activities are subject to regulation and enforcement activities including the federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and “do not call” legislation, which may increase the cost of telemarketing activities and expose us to enforcement actions if we do not comply. We mitigate this risk by using permission-based marketing in some instances and have implemented procedures to comply with federal and state “do not call” regulations, including subscription to federal and certain state “do not call” registries and maintenance of an internal “do not call” list. Similarly, state and federal regulations may place limitations on our ability to engage our consumers in electronic mail marketing campaigns, including requirements applicable to the transmission of email messages with the primary purpose of advertising or promoting a commercial product or service. We have adopted email messaging practices responsive to the requirements of such regulations.

In addition, many jurisdictions, including many in the U.S., require that we file detailed registration or offering statements with regulatory authorities disclosing information regarding our VOIs, such as information concerning the intervals being offered, the project, resort or program to which the intervals relate, applicable timeshare plans, evidence of title, details regarding our business, the purchaser’s rights and obligations with respect to such intervals, and a description of the manner in which we intend to offer and advertise such intervals.

When we sell VOIs, local law grants the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a purchase contract during a specified rescission period following the later of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser received the last of the documents required to be provided by us.

Purchaser Financing Regulation

Our purchaser financing activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations including those of applicable supervisory agencies such as, in the U.S., the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These laws and regulations, some of which contain exceptions applicable to the timeshare industry, may include, among others, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act and implementing regulations, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E, unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices regulations and the Credit Practices rules, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and the Bank Secrecy Act. Our purchaser financing activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair 

10
debt collection and credit reporting practices, consumer debt collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender or mortgage loan originator licensing and registration and anti-money laundering.

Property Management Regulation

Our property management activities are subject to laws and regulations regarding community association management, public lodging, food and beverage services, liquor licensing, labor, employment, health care, health and safety, accessibility, discrimination, immigration, gaming, and the environment (including climate change). In addition, many jurisdictions in which we manage our resorts have statutory provisions that limit the duration of the initial and renewal terms of our management agreements for property owners’ associations.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Employee Profile 

We recognize our employees as associates who bring our mission to put the world on vacation to life through their service to the world’s leading membership and leisure travel company.

Oversight and Management

Our human resources organization manages employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation planning, performance management, and professional development. Our Board of Directors (“Board”) and its committees also provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including diversity and inclusion initiatives. Our Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews matters of corporate social responsibility and sustainability performance, including potential trends and impacts of environmental, social, and governance issues that affect human capital matters. Our Compensation Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing certain of our human capital programs, policies and procedures, including management succession planning and development. The Compensation Committee is also responsible for periodically reviewing incentives and risks related to our compensation programs. Furthermore, our Audit Committee discusses compliance risks related to human capital matters and periodically reviews and updates our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to promote ethical behavior by all of our associates.

As the unprecedented events of 2020 suspended global travel, we recalibrated operations and drove agile, sustained connectivity to our worldwide team of associates, many of whom began to work remotely. We executed a workforce transformation aligned with the closure and reduction of operations around the world. Staffing related cost savings were achieved through a significant reduction in our workforce and the furlough of thousands of associates during 2020. Benefits were provided to associates for the duration of their furlough and severance was provided to associates that were separated from Travel + Leisure Co. As of December 31, 2021, we have reopened all of the resorts and sales offices in North America that we expect to reopen. The remaining closed resorts and sales offices that we intend to reopen are located in the South Pacific and are expected to reopen in 2022, contingent upon the lifting of government imposed travel restrictions. As a result of these reopenings the vast majority of our furloughed employees have returned to work.

As of December 31, 2021, our global team was comprised of more than 16,800 associates, more than 3,500 of whom work outside the U.S.; 14,100 associates support Vacation Ownership, 2,600 associates support Travel and Membership, and 100 associates comprise our corporate group. Less than 1% of our associates are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with our company.

Employee Development

We seek to attract and retain top talent through our commitment to shared values and competencies, and the development of each associate as an integral contributor to our business and our culture. Our internal pipeline of talent is strengthened by our ability to help associates develop knowledge, skills, and a network of supporters throughout their career. We promote four competencies for all associates: Customer Obsession, Decision Velocity, Transparency, and Empowerment. Associates are encouraged to master these competencies through individual development plans, performance reviews, and training. Examples of our employee development programs and initiatives include:

•Global Learning and Development: Our proprietary Destination U resource is a comprehensive solution that puts the ownership of each associate’s career development directly into their hands. By fostering growth potential for all associates at Travel + Leisure Co., we enable each individual to clearly understand their role in the context of the larger organization and to access development courses designed specifically to further their development.

11
•Programs focused on career progression include: formal talent reviews, succession planning, high-potential associate development programs, executive coaching, leader onboarding plans, new leader orientation and transition training, and tuition and certification reimbursement.

Inclusion and Diversity

We understand that a culture of rich inclusion and diversity enhances our performance and ability to serve our customers. We strive to cultivate an inclusive environment where each individual is embraced as they are, and where each associate feels appreciated, respected, and valued as a contributor at every level within the organization.

•Our inclusive talent acquisition strategy focuses on developing a diverse pipeline of candidates that includes applicants from a variety of backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. This includes women, diverse ethnicities, veterans, LGBTQIA+, those with disabilities, generational diversity, and more.

•Our Global Inclusion and Diversity Council (“GIDC”) is comprised of an associate-led global team of diverse senior and executive leaders. The mission of the GIDC is to foster, cultivate, and design actions to strengthen our culture and global communities, through inclusion, equitable opportunities, and social justice. 

•We host voluntary, associate-led diversity resource groups for our Asian/Pacific Islander, Black/African American, Hispanic/Latinx, LGBTQIA+, Veteran, and Women associates. Diversity resource groups foster affiliation with colleagues across the business, and are designed to enable the personal growth, professional development, and retention of diverse talent. Participants have the opportunity to develop their careers through learning, leadership exposure, and business engagement. Our partnerships with inclusion and diversity organizations at national and regional levels provide a platform for our associates to develop leadership skills and gain inclusion and diversity education, while executives are given the opportunity to showcase thought leadership at sponsored programs and events.

•Our roadmap to drive progress in inclusion and diversity is guided by our goals of continuing to enhance a diverse talent pipeline to increase diverse representation at the director and above level, continued focus on diverse hires at all levels, and maintaining and growing our business relationships with companies that have diverse ownership.

We remain committed to “Listen, Learn, and Act” to sustain engagement and responsiveness. Travel + Leisure Co. President and CEO Michael Brown signed the CEO Diversity Action Pledge in partnership with CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion, joining more than 2,000 global organizations who have pledged to act on supporting a more inclusive workplace for employees, communities, and society at large. Also Michael Brown was among 75 Central Florida leaders to sign the first-ever Orlando Economic Partnership Regional Corporate Pledge in 2020, committing to improve regional diversity, equity, and inclusion outcomes.

In an effort to improve employee diversity at the director-and-above level, we have implemented an approach where at least 50% of the candidate slate for any open employee position will be gender and/or ethnically diverse to the greatest extent practicable. During 2021, we improved diversity at the director-and-above level by 8%. During 2021, we had 6,102 active hires and our turnover rate was 62%, which is below the annual average for the industry for the proceeding five-year period per the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

As of December 31, 2021, 53% of our global associates were women, 44% were men, and 3% were not declared. Also at December 31, 2021, 53% of our global leaders with direct reports were men and 47% were women. The following table provides the global gender distribution by level:

(a)Includes our executive officers which are 89% white and 11% diverse.

In addition to employee diversity, we have diverse representation on our Board, with four of our nine board members being gender and/or ethnically diverse.

Competitive Pay/Benefits

We offer a comprehensive total rewards program designed to attract and retain top talent, fuel our business objectives, and reward performance. Our total rewards package reflects our commitment to our associates and includes competitive pay, healthcare benefits, retirement savings plans, paid time off including parental leave, and other mental health and well-being support. Approximately 97% of our associates are eligible to participate in a company sponsored retirement plan or a mandatory pension plan in their country of residence, subject to plan terms. We also have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan with a 10% discount from the fair market value at the grant date available to approximately 89% of our associates. We regularly review our design and offerings to ensure alignment with country and regional competitive practices.

We believe in performance-based variable compensation programs that support a high performance environment. All of our managers participate in an annual incentive plan that most closely aligns with their role. Our sales and marketing associates at all levels across our business lines participate in variable compensation plans aligned to their role. Approximately 50% of our associates participate in a variable pay incentive pay program.

Health & Safety

The health and safety of our associates is of the utmost importance. In response to the global pandemic, we created a COVID-19-specific plan for the safety and well-being of our associates, guests, and customers. This plan mirrored the direction from the Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and Prevention guidelines for the U.S. and other equivalent government agencies in the regions where we operate globally. As part of our response, many of our employees worked remotely.

In response to many of our employees beginning to return to the office, we have adopted a global “We’ll Be Ready” return to work plan. This plan is a comprehensive and evolving resource outlining the protocols and actions we have taken to protect our associates including:

•Transitioning associates to work from home, or work a hybrid work schedule, wherever possible.

•Mandatory onsite temperature checks and health screenings at select locations.

•Requiring the use of masks onsite for unvaccinated associates and as required by local ordinance.

•Promotion of onsite social distancing.

•Requiring sick associates to stay home.

•Immediate contact tracing response.

•Enhanced onsite cleaning protocols in alignment with CDC, World Health Organization (“WHO”), and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) protocols.

•Enhanced safety and health training specific to COVID-19.

•Vaccine education and incentive initiatives.

•Time off for associates who choose to be vaccinated.

•Required COVID-19 symptom awareness attestation.

•Certified “We’ll Be Ready” health and safety champions at all resorts and sale sites.

SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 

We are committed to delivering stakeholder value through our Social Responsibility program, Full Circle, which remains an integral part of our company culture and global business operations. We strive to cultivate an inclusive environment, in which our associates, customers, suppliers, and communities feel appreciated, respected, and valued.

We are committed to sustainable business practices with a focus on social responsibility. Our 2025 environmental goals are to reduce carbon emissions 40% and water consumption 35% at our owned, managed, and leased assets (based on square foot intensity) compared to our 2010 baseline. We have also joined the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Challenge with a goal to reduce energy usage intensity 20% within U.S. operations by 2024.

Compared to our 2010 baseline, we have reduced carbon emissions intensity 29% and exceeded our original water withdrawal goal of 25%, while increasing our overall portfolio square footage by 16%, which includes our managed resorts, corporate offices, and leased locations, including our sales and administrative offices and data centers. During 2021, we set a new goal to reduce our water withdrawal 35% by 2025. We have also set a goal to plant two million trees by 2025. As of December 31, 2021, we have planted more than 1.7 million trees. Part of our innovative approach to carbon sequestration measures is addressed through annual reforestation projects, protection of existing forests, and the sourcing of carbon neutral coffee. Our ongoing commitment to reduce carbon emissions includes the implementation of an offsite solar project and 17 onsite solar projects to-date.

With a focus on improving the lives of children and families through vacations, we support charitable organizations with a similar focus and mission. Our philanthropic efforts drive support for organizations including Give Kids the World Village, Jack and Jill Late Stage Cancer Foundation, and our Associate Relief Fund. Our decades long history of partnership with Christel House International supports educational opportunities for children in underserved global communities. Additionally, through contributions to Step Up for Students, we support providing low-income families in Florida the opportunity to choose the best education for their children. Most recently, we established the Travel + Leisure Charitable Foundation. This foundation will embrace a diverse and inclusive community through a variety of programs, including leadership training, mentoring opportunities, and educational support. Since its formation, the Travel + Leisure Charitable Foundation has partnered with the School Board of Orange County, Florida, to create the Travel + Leisure Eatonville scholarship program, which strives to promote educational excellence within the Eatonville community, the oldest African-American-incorporated municipality in the U.S., by providing scholarships to eligible students.

We are committed to being an employer and neighbor of choice in the communities where we have a presence. Our commitment is recognized through prestigious honors including Newsweek’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies, the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce’s Best-of-the-Best, the National Veteran-Owned Business Association’s Top 2021 Best Corporations for Veteran’s Business Enterprises, Forbes’ America’s Best Large Employers, and the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, among others.

We remain committed to the highest standards of ethics, integrity, and responsible business practices across our global operations. Published in 13 languages, our associate Code of Conduct reinforces ethical practices including the equal and fair treatment of associates, owners, and guests; health and safety; avoiding and reporting conflicts of interest; protecting our information; anti-corruption; and financial and reporting integrity. We encourage the reporting of any concerns without fear of retaliation through channels including our 24-hour integrity internal reporting hotline. Aligned with our stand against human trafficking, and in partnership with ECPAT International, we were the first vacation ownership company to sign the Tourism Child Protection Code of Conduct and to enforce required training and education for associates globally in order to protect children from exploitation.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

Our compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and discharge of hazardous materials has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not anticipate any material impact from such compliance in the future.

CLIMATE CHANGE

There has been public discussion that climate change is associated with extreme weather conditions and other natural disasters, such as increased frequency and severity of storms and floods, coastal erosion and flooding due to higher sea levels, increased 

14
temperatures, and increased forest fires. We manage properties exposed to areas which are susceptible to adverse effects resulting from these conditions and disasters. Based upon insurable property values as of December 31, 2021, approximately 35% of our managed properties are located in Tier I windstorm exposure areas, approximately 20% are located in areas with a high level of flood risk; and approximately 20% are located in high-risk wildfire-prone states. It is possible that the weather conditions and other natural disasters associated with climate change could increase in frequency and/or severity in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our managed property portfolio, operating costs, and demand for our products and/or services.

KEY AGREEMENTS RELATED TO THE SPIN-OFF

This section summarizes the material agreements between Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels that govern the ongoing relationships between the two companies after the Spin-off. Additional or modified agreements, arrangements, and transactions, which would be negotiated at arm’s length, may be entered into in the future. These summaries are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the applicable agreements, which are incorporated by reference herein.

As of May 31, 2018, when the Spin-off was completed, Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels operated independently, and neither company has any ownership interest in the other. Before the Spin-off, we entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with Wyndham Hotels related to the Spin-off. These agreements govern the relationship following completion of the Spin-off and provide for the allocation of various assets, liabilities, rights, and obligations. The following is a summary of the terms of the material agreements we entered into with Wyndham Hotels. The following summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of each agreement, which is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K included in Part IV, Item 15 as Exhibits 2.5, 10.57, 10.58, 10.59, and 10.60.

Separation and Distribution Agreement 

We entered into a Separation and Distribution Agreement with Wyndham Hotels regarding the principal actions taken or to be taken in connection with the Spin-off. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provided for the allocation of assets and liabilities between Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels and established certain rights and obligations between the parties following the Distribution.

Transfer of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provided for those transfers of assets and assumptions of liabilities that were necessary in connection with the Spin-off so that Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels allocated the assets necessary to operate their respective businesses, and retain or assume the liabilities allocated to them in accordance with the separation plan. The Separation and Distribution Agreement also provided for the settlement or extinguishment of certain liabilities and other obligations among Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels. In particular, the Separation and Distribution Agreement provided that, subject to certain terms and conditions: 

•The assets that have been retained by or transferred to Wyndham Hotels (“SpinCo assets”) include, but are not limited to:

•all of the equity interests of Wyndham Hotels;

•any and all assets reflected on the audited combined balance sheet of the Wyndham Hotels businesses;

•any and all contracts primarily relating to the Wyndham Hotels businesses; and

•all rights in the “Wyndham” trademark and “The Registry Collection” trademark, and certain intellectual property related thereto. 

•The liabilities that have been retained by or transferred to Wyndham Hotels (“SpinCo liabilities”) include, but are not limited to: 

•any and all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise, and subject to certain exceptions) to the extent primarily related to, arising out of or resulting from (i) the operation or conduct of the Wyndham Hotels businesses or (ii) the SpinCo assets;

•any and all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) relating to, arising out of or resulting from any form, registration statement, schedule or similar disclosure document filed or furnished with the SEC, to the extent such filing is either made by Wyndham Hotels or made by us in connection with the Spin-off, subject to each party’s indemnification obligations under the Separation and Distribution Agreement with respect to any misstatement of or omission to state a material fact contained in any such filing to the extent the misstatement or omission is based upon information that was furnished by such party;

•any and all liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from any indebtedness of Wyndham Hotels or any indebtedness secured exclusively by any of the Wyndham Hotels assets; and

15
•any and all liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) reflected on the audited combined balance sheet of the Wyndham Hotels businesses. 

•Wyndham Hotels assumed one-third and Travel + Leisure Co. assumed two-thirds of certain contingent and other corporate liabilities of Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels (“shared contingent liabilities”) in each case incurred prior to the Distribution, including our liabilities related to, arising out of or resulting from (i) certain terminated or divested businesses, (ii) certain general corporate matters of Travel + Leisure Co., and (iii) any actions with respect to the separation plan or the Distribution made or brought by any third party.

•Wyndham Hotels is entitled to receive one-third and Travel + Leisure Co. is entitled to receive two-thirds of the proceeds (or, in certain cases, a portion thereof) from certain contingent and other corporate assets of Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels (“shared contingent assets”) arising or accrued prior to the Distribution, including our assets related to, arising from or involving (i) certain terminated or divested businesses, and (ii) certain general corporate matters of Travel + Leisure Co. 

•In connection with the sale of our European vacation rentals business, Wyndham Hotels assumed one-third and Travel + Leisure Co. assumed two-thirds of certain shared contingent liabilities and certain shared contingent assets.

•Except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement, the corporate costs and expenses relating to the Spin-off will be paid by the party with whom such costs were incurred, from a separate account maintained by each of Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure Co. and established prior to completion of the Spin-off on terms agreed upon by Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure Co. and, to the extent the funds in such separate account are not sufficient to satisfy such costs and expenses, be treated as shared contingent liabilities (as described above).

•All of our assets and liabilities (whether accrued, contingent or otherwise) other than the SpinCo assets and SpinCo liabilities, subject to certain exceptions (including the shared contingent assets and shared contingent liabilities), have been retained by or transferred to Travel + Leisure Co., except as set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement or one of the other agreements described below. 

Release of Claims and Indemnification. Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels have agreed to broad releases pursuant to which each releases the other and certain related persons specified in the Separation and Distribution Agreement from any claims against any of them that arise out of or relate to events, circumstances or actions occurring or failing to occur or alleged to occur or to have failed to occur or any conditions existing or alleged to exist at or prior to the time of the Distribution. These releases are subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement and the ancillary agreements. The Separation and Distribution Agreement provides for cross-indemnities that, except as otherwise provided in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, are principally designed to place financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Wyndham Hotels’ business with Wyndham Hotels, and financial responsibility for the obligations and liabilities of Travel + Leisure Co.’s business with Travel + Leisure Co. Specifically, each party will, and will cause its subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other party, its affiliates and subsidiaries and each of its and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents for any losses arising out of, by reason of or otherwise in connection with: 

•the liabilities each such party assumed or retained pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement; 

•any misstatement of or omission to state a material fact contained in any party’s public filings, only to the extent the misstatement or omission is based upon information that was furnished by the indemnifying party (or incorporated by reference from a filing of such indemnifying party) and then only to the extent the statement or omission was made or occurred after the Spin-off; and 

•any breach by such party of the Separation and Distribution Agreement or any ancillary agreement unless such ancillary agreement expressly provides for separate indemnification therein, in which case any such indemnification claims will be made thereunder.

The amount of each party’s indemnification obligations are subject to reduction by any insurance proceeds received by the party being indemnified. Except in the case of tax assets and liabilities related to the sale of our European vacation rentals business, indemnification with respect to taxes are governed solely by the Tax Matters Agreement.

Employee Matters Agreement

We are party to an Employee Matters Agreement with Wyndham Hotels that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure Co. following the Spin-off. The Employee Matters Agreement addresses the allocation of employees between Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure Co. as well as other employment, compensation 

16
and benefits-related matters. As of January 1, 2021, Wyndham Hotels’ employees no longer participate in Travel + Leisure Co.’s plans or programs, and Wyndham Hotels has established plans or programs for their employees as described in the Employee Matters Agreement. 

Tax Matters Agreement

We have a Tax Matters Agreement with Wyndham Hotels that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Wyndham Hotels and Travel + Leisure Co. following the Spin-off with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. As a former subsidiary of Travel + Leisure Co., Wyndham Hotels has joint and several liability with us to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the combined U.S. federal income taxes of the Travel + Leisure Co. consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which Wyndham Hotels was part of that group. In general, the Tax Matters Agreement specifies that Wyndham Hotels will bear one-third, and Travel + Leisure Co. two-thirds, of this tax liability, and Wyndham Hotels has agreed to indemnify us against any amounts for which we are not responsible including subject to the next sentence. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the Spin-off is not tax-free. In general, if a party’s actions cause the Spin-off not to be tax-free, that party will be responsible for the payment of any resulting tax liabilities (and will indemnify the other party with respect thereto). The Tax Matters Agreement provides for certain covenants that may restrict our ability to pursue strategic or other transactions that otherwise could maximize the value of our business. Although valid as between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement will not be binding on the IRS.

License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement

In connection with the Spin-off, we entered into a license, development and noncompetition agreement with Wyndham Hotels, which, among other things, granted to Travel + Leisure Co. the right to use the “Wyndham” trademark, “The Registry Collection” trademark and certain other trademarks and intellectual property in our business. This right is generally limited to use in connection with our vacation ownership and vacation exchange businesses, with certain limited exceptions. This agreement has a term of 100 years with an option for us to extend the term for an additional 30 years. We will pay Wyndham Hotels certain royalties and other fees under this agreement. 

Additionally, the License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement governs arrangements between us and Wyndham Hotels with respect to the development of new projects and non-compete obligations. These non-compete obligations restrict us and Wyndham Hotels from competing with the other party’s business (subject to customary carve-outs) for the first 25 years of the term of the License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement, and we may extend the term of these non-compete obligations for an additional five year term if we achieve a certain sales target in the last full calendar year of the initial 25-year term. If either party acquires a business that competes with the other party’s businesses, Wyndham Hotels or Travel + Leisure Co., must offer the other party the right to acquire such competing business upon and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement. Additionally, if either party engages in a project that has a component that competes with the other party’s businesses, Wyndham Hotels or Travel + Leisure Co., must use commercially reasonable efforts to include the other party in such project, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement. In January 2021, Travel + Leisure Co. and Wyndham Hotels entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Wyndham Hotels waived its right to enforce certain noncompetition covenants in the License, Development and Noncompetition Agreement.
