PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The Company

With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company employs approximately 6,400 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to over 14 million people in 24 states. The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as the “Market-Based Businesses,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

On December 9, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), the Company sold all of the equity interests of the HOS subsidiaries. See Item 1—Business—Market-Based Businesses—Sale of Homeowner Services Group below and Note 6—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary, see Item 1—Business—Regulated Businesses—Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc. below and Note 6—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. The assets and related liabilities of the New York subsidiary were classified as held for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries.

Regulated Businesses

The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 14 states in the United States, with 3.4 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). Federal, state and local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,384 million for 2021, $3,255 million for 2020 and $3,094 million for 2019, accounting for 86%, 86% and 86%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

The Company completed the sale of its Michigan subsidiary on February 4, 2022.

Customers

The Company’s Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the Company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses. Examples of these customers are homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.

The vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage, typically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.

Residential customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i) commercial customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater for their own customers.

The following chart depicts the allocation of the Company’s Regulated Businesses’ operating revenue of $3,384 million by type, including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer, for the year ended December 31, 2021:

(a)Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts.

(b)Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.

Presented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the Company served by class as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, which represents approximately 14 million people served as of December 31, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Includes public authorities and other utilities and community water and wastewater systems under bulk contracts. Bulk contracts, which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above, generally result in service to multiple customers.

Customer growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.

Capital Investment

The Company plans to invest between $28 billion and $32 billion over the next 10 years for capital improvements, including acquisitions, to its Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 110-year replacement cycle by 2026, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,200 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2022 and 2026. In addition, from 2022 to 2026, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal, resiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company continues to invest significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. The benefit of investing in resiliency projects was seen firsthand in the aftermath of Tropical Depression Ida, when the Company’s New Jersey subsidiary reported that all its operating areas successfully withstood widespread flooding and drinking water quality was not impacted in any of its service areas. Specifically, the New Jersey subsidiary’s Raritan-Millstone Water Treatment Plant, which was fortified with a $37 million flood protection project in 2018, withstood a record flood and continued to provide potable water supply for approximately 1 million people in parts of seven counties in central New Jersey.

Regulation and Rate Making

The operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs being the promotion of the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations, mergers and acquisitions, and dispositions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and can change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.

Periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and the recognition in rates of that change.

The Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices:

Regulatory PracticesDescriptionStates Allowed

Infrastructure replacement surcharge mechanismsAllows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe and reliable services for the Company’s customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency.IA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA, WV

Future test yearA “test year” is a period used for setting rates, and a future test year describes the first 12 months that new rates are proposed to be effective. The use of a future test year allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis.CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY, PA, TN, VA

Hybrid test yearA historical test year sets rates using data from a 12-month period that ends prior to a general rate case filing. A hybrid test year allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year.MD, MO, NJ, WV

Utility plant recovery mechanismsAllows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction (“AFUDC”). In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects.CA, IL, KY, PA, TN, VA

Expense mechanismsAllows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control, to be recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding.CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ, PA, TN, VA

Revenue stability mechanismsAdjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility recovers the revenues authorized in its general rate case, regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently.CA, IL

Consolidated tariffsUse of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state, and is generally used to moderate the price impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements.CA, IA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, NJ, PA, VA, WV

Deferred accountingA regulators’ willingness to defer recognition of financial impacts when setting rates for utilities.All

7
The Company pursues enhancements to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments and to continue to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment using the regulatory practices described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply and enhance certain mechanisms where they already exist.

Acquisitions and Strategic Growth

The U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates, as of 2017, that there are approximately 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less.

A fundamental aspect of the Company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses, see Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using the Company’s existing management (although the Company typically retains the majority, if not all, of the employees of the acquired systems) and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of 93% water and 7% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing the Company to add wastewater customers where it already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers, as well as a line of sight to grow the Company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.

Increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality and water accountability regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment, financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements, among others, that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.

Sale of New York American Water Company, Inc.

On January 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its New York subsidiary to Liberty Utilities (Eastern Water Holdings) Corp. (“Liberty”), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated November 20, 2019, as amended, by and among the Company, the Company’s New York subsidiary and Liberty (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), Liberty purchased from the Company all of the capital stock of the Company’s New York subsidiary for a purchase price of $608 million in cash. The sale was approved by the New York State Department of Public Service on December 16, 2021. The Company’s regulated New York operations had approximately 127,000 customers in the State of New York. See Note 6—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Industry Legislation

On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (the “IIJA”) was signed into law and provides for up to $55 billion to aid in improving the country’s ailing water infrastructure, including $23.4 billion for drinking water and wastewater, $15 billion for lead service line replacement (through the drinking water state revolving fund), and $10 billion for the treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) and other contaminants of emerging concern. The bill also includes a low-income assistance program, which provides eligible low-income customers who receive their water from public and private entities to be eligible to participate in the program. The Company is awaiting further guidance on the distribution of these funds.

In December 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, a $900 billion COVID-19 relief and $1.4 trillion U.S. government appropriations package for 2021, which included $638 million for a low-income water assistance program and $2.8 billion for capitalization grants under the Clean Water and Drinking Water State Revolving Funds.

In 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey, including municipal and investor-owned utilities with more than 500 service connections. This law imposes requirements in areas such as asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager, or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. Enhanced WQAA legislation includes additional enforcement requirements for disclosure of results, requires the sale of systems for prolonged violations and imposes new cyber security requirements and asset management plans. The new amendments, which provide for both civil and criminal penalties for falsification of documents, were signed by the Governor with an effective date of November 8, 2021.

In 2018, Indiana passed a law to set minimum operational expectations for all water and wastewater utilities in the state, including municipal and investor-owned utilities. The law requires water and wastewater utilities to conduct rate analyses, develop capital asset management plans and conduct cybersecurity and water loss audits. It also requires water and wastewater utilities to participate in regional discussions and planning to assess opportunities for the more efficient use of water and wastewater utility assets and infrastructure. Water and wastewater utilities that fail to comply with the requirements of the law may be ineligible for grants and loans from the State Revolving Fund. Under the law, all new municipal and investor-owned utilities are required to be regulated by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for ten years from inception of operations.

In 2020, Missouri enacted the Water Safety and Security Act, which requires small and medium-sized water providers to create cybersecurity, valve inspection and hydrant inspection programs. Upon request by the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, the water providers must certify compliance with all regulations regarding water quality sampling, testing and reporting, hydrant and valve testing and reporting and cybersecurity plans and procedures.

The Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia have access to utility valuation legislation and regulation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, which allows the Company to offer municipalities a purchase price for their system assets that is reflective of the assets’ fair market value, while providing the Company with increased opportunity to recover the purchase price over the life of the purchased system assets, subject to PUC approval. In 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission implemented acquisition valuation rules that create a mechanism to value water and wastewater assets based upon replacement cost new less depreciation.

Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in a state. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility, support economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, the Company believes that consolidated tariffs bring cost-effective, high-quality services to a larger number of customers. Eleven of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.

Competition

The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs or other authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However, the Company’s Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic acquisitions. When pursuing acquisitions, the Company’s largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, include Essential Utilities, Inc., Suez North America, American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, the Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy and Corix.

Condemnation and Eminent Domain

All or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.

As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in Monterey, California successfully added “Measure J” to the November 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the Monterey water service system assets (the “Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. In August 2019, the MPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition; (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system; (3) evaluate whether the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD is in the public interest and sufficiently satisfies the criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J; (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition; and (5) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.

In November 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. On June 12, 2020, the MPWMD issued a draft environmental impact report for the potential acquisition of the Monterey system assets and a related district boundary adjustment that would be required if the MPWMD were to acquire and operate certain of the Monterey system assets located outside the MPWMD’s boundaries. On September 15, 2020, the MPWMD gave notice of its intention to appraise the Monterey system assets and related property interests. On September 29, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary declined to make the Monterey system assets and related property interests available for inspection or to comply with any of the other requests contained in the MPWMD’s notice. On October 7, 2020, the MPWMD issued a final environmental impact report (“FEIR”), and on November 4, 2020, the MPWMD certified the FEIR, which purports to analyze the environmental impacts of the MPWMD’s project to (1) acquire the Monterey system assets through the power of eminent domain, if necessary, and (2) expand its geographic boundaries to include all parts of this system. On November 25, 2020, the Company’s California subsidiary filed a petition challenging this certification in court. A hearing on the matter was held on August 30, 2021, and on November 19, 2021, the court denied the petition. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Challenge of Certification—Proposed Monterey System Final Environmental Impact Report.

On February 26, 2021, the MPWMD filed an application with the Local Agency Formation Commission of Monterey County (“LAFCO”) seeking approval to become a retail water provider and annex approximately 58 parcels of land into the MPWMD’s boundaries. On June 28, 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners voted to require a third-party independent financial study as to the feasibility of an acquisition by the MPWMD of the Monterey system assets. On December 6, 2021, LAFCO’s commissioners denied the MPWMD’s application to become a retail water provider, determining that the MPWMD does not have the authority to proceed with a condemnation of the Monterey system assets. On January 5, 2022, LAFCO’s commissioners confirmed the denial. On January 31, 2022, the MPWMD filed an application for reconsideration of LAFCO’s confirmation of denial. A hearing on the application has been set for February 28, 2022. 

Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the Company in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminent domain lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. The parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports. A valuation trial was originally scheduled for October 2021 but has been continued to June 2022.

10
Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some of these lawsuits have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.

Water Supply and Wastewater Services

The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only.

Presented in the chart below are the Company’s sources of water supply as of December 31, 2021:

Presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the Company’s Top Five States for the year ended December 31, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

11
The Company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.

The Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity to provide water service to its customers. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. The Company reviews current climate science and global models related to temperature, precipitation and sea level rise on an ongoing basis. Where actionable forecasts are available, the Company will use this information in its comprehensive planning studies and asset management plans. These studies and plans, which are used by the Company to develop its asset management and system reliability strategies, assess the climate risk and resiliency of the Company’s water and wastewater systems over short-, medium- and long-term time horizons, and include evaluations of the availability of water supplies and system capacity against a number of different factors, projections and estimates.

 In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. In California, where the state has been experiencing a multi-year drought, the Company utilizes multiple water supply options including numerous ground water wells in multiple aquifers as well as various long-term purchase water agreements with regional water suppliers to optimize supplies while assuring resiliency during dry years. An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, to be owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions and Note 17—Commitments and Contingencies—Contingencies—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.

Seasonality

Customer demand for the Company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Two of the Company’s jurisdictions, California and Illinois, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See Regulated Businesses—Regulation and Rate Making for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.

Market-Based Businesses

The Company’s Market-Based Businesses provide water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, and utility customers, and previously provided home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers through its former HOS business, which was sold on December 9, 2021. These businesses are not subject to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Company’s Market-Based Businesses were $563 million for 2021, $540 million for 2020 and $539 million for 2019, accounting for 14%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

12
MSG enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations. MSG is the Company’s remaining primary market-based business.

The Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its Contract Services Group (“CSG”).

Military Services Group

MSG operates on 17 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utilities Privatization Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to MSG is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission, and the construction of these assets is funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital for these assets historically has not been funded through the Company’s debt or equity issuances; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects under existing contracts, but the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement on existing contracts has limited the need for such financing. However, recent U.S. Army and Navy Utilities Privatization solicitations have included requirements for the successful bidder to finance discrete initial capital projects over either a five- or ten-year period after project completion. Three of MSG’s current contracts require such capital project financing, which the Company is currently addressing through internal sources of liquidity.

The contract price for six of MSG’s contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining 11 contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All 17 contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the MSG subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts, MSG would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs. MSG’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $6.2 billion, with an average remaining contract term of 41 years.

Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regulation

The Company’s water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by both its Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses, are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges, recycles and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under federal legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act, and under a variety of applicable state laws. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the federal standard. For example, while the EPA has issued a non-enforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid, or PFOS), the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection was the first state agency to establish a standard for perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, in 2018 and has since established maximum containment levels for PFOA and PFOS, with implementation occurring in January 2021. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.

The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices focused on compliance with environmental laws and regulations and the effective use of natural resources, recognizing that drinking water standards have generally, over time, increased in number and become increasingly more stringent. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, the Company’s capital and operating costs needed to comply with them will likely increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring of water quality issues. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $850 million over the next five years, including $180 million in 2022, for environmental control facilities, which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.

The Company’s operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, the Company’s water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs to the Company. The Company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder.

Safe Drinking Water Act

The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous, naturally occurring and manufactured chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for over 90 contaminants and water quality indicators for drinking water, and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.

To help formulate the basis for future regulations, the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional, unregulated contaminants under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the “Monitoring Rule”). The Company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring Rule in previous rounds, which occurs every five years, including the fourth round that concluded at the end of 2020. There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which lack a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/or cost-effective treatment options. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See Research and Development—Contaminants of Emerging Concern for additional information.

14
To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial contaminants, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and/or the by-products of their use in the disinfection process. Examples of these rules are the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule (the “Long-Term 2 Rule”), the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule, the Ground Water Rule, which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources and the revised Total Coliform Rule, which implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with all of these standards, which includes sample collection, data analysis, and, in some instances engineering planning and implementation of treatment enhancements. Recent monitoring as required by the Long-Term 2 Rule has indicated that up to 30 of the Company’s surface water systems have recently completed or need to implement additional disinfection protection mechanisms against Cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing ultraviolet light disinfection systems, and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $100 million to $150 million of investment will still be required to upgrade the remaining facilities for Cryptosporidium disinfection. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride, nitrosamines, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2022.

The Company conducted over 10 million water quality and turbidity tests in 2021 at its laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. The Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 67 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, the Company accounts for approximately one-third of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 66 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62 plants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 57 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award, and 39 plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards and have maintained this status for at least five years.

Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current cost requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.

Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act

In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace lead service lines (“LSLs”) in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA finalized revisions to the LCR (the “Revised LCR”) on January 15, 2021 that are designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. The Company is executing an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements, which were originally mandated by January 2024 but have been delayed until at least late 2024 pending EPA additional review. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with the Revised LCR will be determined once the EPA completes its additional review, but as previously noted, costs associated with compliance with federal water quality regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.

15
The Company currently estimates that less than 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or customer portion of the service line. The Company is replacing LSLs as part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. The Company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most of its service areas by the end of 2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most of its service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal. The IIJA was signed into law in November 2021 and provides for up to $15 billion for lead service line replacement through drinking water state revolving funds. The Company is awaiting further guidance on eligibility, the application process and the distribution of these funds. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal is dependent on several factors, including the Company’s planned water main and service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases, these and other factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement. Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line; full LSL replacement is also consistent with the Revised LCR. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level.

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to requirements applicable to the Company’s wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result in fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.

Research and Development

The Company’s Research and Development Program

The Company maintains an industry-leading research and development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, support its compliance activities, improve service quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, American Water’s R&D program has evolved into an industry-leading effort and has achieved numerous advancements in the science of drinking water, wastewater, and desalination. Through laboratory and industry resources and the team’s expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging concern, including but not limited to COVID-19, PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, a variety of pathogens (for example, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, enteric viruses, and various bacteria), microbial indicators and disinfection byproducts. The Company’s R&D personnel are located at the Company’s corporate headquarters and at two laboratory testing facilities in New Jersey and Illinois, the latter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which supports the Company’s R&D activities through testing and analysis.

The Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborates with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards and regulations. This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data. The Company’s engagement with the EPA provides it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing the Company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements. The Company also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, other state environmental agencies, and national and international water research foundations. The Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry, which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks business and operational growth.

Contaminants of Emerging Concern

Contaminants of emerging concern include numerous chemicals such as PFAS, pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides, endocrine disrupting compounds and industrial chemicals, as well as certain naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been assessed. Technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of these contaminants at trace levels. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has invited discussion about these contaminants among regulators and government agencies, which in turn shapes the public’s perception of drinking water quality.

The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 192 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that can affect humans. The Company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply, to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. The Company utilizes water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help detect potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:

•monitoring impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on environmental virus loads and removal efforts through wastewater systems;

•characterizing factors that contribute to the formation of potentially carcinogenic disinfection by-products to define best practices for their mitigation;

•using its research findings to communicate information to its customers regarding potential actions to limit occurrences of Legionella in their buildings; in this regard, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposure typically associated with customer-owned plumbing systems in large buildings;

•defining a framework to support management or possible future regulation of opportunistic pathogens;

•developing expanded monitoring methods for PFAS compounds and piloting treatment techniques;

•leading a PFAS risk communication strategy for the water sector;

•using innovative technologies to detect and manage algal blooms to help prevent taste and odor events and cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant;

•monitoring of taste and odor issues that impact customer satisfaction using expanded analytical methods to detect compounds, and evaluating and recommending treatment practices;

•implementing water source assessment tools, including sensors and data analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the identification of source water contamination events;

•developing methodology and advanced measurement techniques for contaminants of emerging concern to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and

•implementing activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange treatment to seek to control contaminants of emerging concern.

Human Capital Resources

Overview 

The Company’s people are a critical part of its business, and the Company’s investment in its people begins with recruitment of qualified and diverse talent. The Company believes that representing the communities in which it serves plays a key role in its ability to serve its customers and improves its talent. The Company promotes an inclusive culture where its employees are given the opportunity to develop to their fullest potential and understand that they directly contribute to the Company’s ability to operate, grow and serve its customers. The Company believes that investing in the safety, health and well-being of its employees is a key component of its people and culture goals, and that these investments in its people allow employees to generate great ideas, provide quality customer service and make a difference in the lives of the Company’s customers.

Employee Health and Safety

A longstanding value and strategy of the Company is safety. In this regard, the Company continues to focus on the safety of its employees and contractors so that they may return home from work in the same, or better, condition than when they arrived. The Company strives for all employees to feel emotionally safe, live a healthy lifestyle and be physically safe at work and at home. The Company assesses occupational health and safety to measure performance across the entire organization, with the ultimate goal of achieving zero incidents, injuries and fatalities for the Company’s employees and contractors.

To uphold the Company’s commitment to safety, the Company’s employees completed over 100,000 hours of employee safety training during 2021. Additionally, through frequent labor-management meetings, the Company encourages open exchanges to explore new ways to further enhance safety on the job. All employees are empowered to demonstrate safety leadership by taking the time they need to complete a task safely and to use “Stop Work Authority” — the power to stop working immediately whenever they believe a task is unsafe — to personally mitigate the hazard or issue or collaborate with management to create a safe situation. The Company believes that this Stop Work Authority is so important that it is stated on the back of every employee’s identification badge.

For 2021, the Company had its lowest ORIR injury rate in its recorded history, achieving a 2% reduction compared to 2020, even though labor hours increased by 5%. Also, the number of injuries for purposes of the Company’s Days Away Restricted or Transferred (“DART”) rate decreased by 14% compared to 2020. For 2021, the Company’s ORIR was 0.97 (64 injuries) and its DART rate was 0.54 (36 injuries), compared to an ORIR of 0.99 (63 injuries) and a DART rate of 0.63 in 2020.

In 2021, American Water teams led by promoting safety leading indicator activities, including pre-job safety briefings and near miss reporting, and by achieving internal Certified Safe Worker designations. Near miss reports, where employees report potential hazards or incidents in a safe and secure manner, increased by 27% in 2021 over 2020, and 99% of near miss incident corrective actions were completed within 30 days, meeting the Company’s 2021 goal. The Company utilizes near miss reporting and timely corrective actions as key measurements of employee engagement and safety performance.

Understanding that some employees may have delayed seeking preventative or other medical care due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a 2021 priority for the Company was to encourage employees to increase their utilization of preventative exams. Through the Company’s marketing efforts and targeted incentives in its myWellness program, the Company sought to encourage employees to take preventative health actions. The number of total preventative care exams completed by the Company’s employees increased by 15% during 2021 compared to 2020.

Supporting Employees During the COVID-19 Pandemic

American Water remains committed to the health, well-being and safety of its employees and families, as well as its customers and communities. The Company’s Emergency Crisis Response Team (“ECRT”) continued to deploy a COVID-19 contact tracing program to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at work. The ECRT consistently monitors current events and the latest public health guidance and adjusts workplace safety measures and the Company’s COVID-19 guidance accordingly. During the pandemic, American Water provided temporary medical and emotional health benefits, including paid time off and emergency leave. The Company also supported employees and their families during the uncertainty of the pandemic by providing additional resources, such as enhanced well-being support, workplace flexibility, back-up dependent care, caretaker database discounts and academic support. American Water did not lay off any employees due to the pandemic.

As an essential business that must continue to provide water and wastewater services during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company continued to focus on the care and safety of its employees, contractors, vendors and others who work at or visit the Company’s worksites. In 2021, as COVID-19 vaccines became more readily available, the Company began planning for the reintegration of those who had been working remotely back to its work facilities, and also began to implement safety protocols based on current COVID-19 health guidance for the return of employees to perform work in customers’ homes. Furthermore, the Company has continued to support employee health and safety by providing safety training and resources, continuing to enforce safety protocols such as maintaining social distancing, requiring the use of face coverings at work, and encouraging good hygiene and frequent handwashing and cleaning of work areas. The Company continues to receive input from its employees via pulse surveys throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, which has also helped to shape the Company’s pandemic-related responses and a flexible return to hybrid work where possible. Throughout the fall of 2021, managers and employees who had been working remotely during the pandemic began to return to the Company’s offices and facilities with increasing frequency, in preparation for a three-day in-person, two-day remote work week, where feasible.

Inclusion, Diversity and Equity

In 2021, the Company continued to evolve its inclusion and diversity strategic framework to include equity. The Company defines equity as fair treatment, access, opportunity and advancement for all people, while also eliminating barriers that may prevent some groups from full participation. The Company promotes an environment where inclusion, diversity and equity are embedded in its culture. At all levels, the Company strives to understand, respect, value and provide equal opportunity to each employee. The Company seeks to foster an environment where employees’ differences are embraced and celebrated. The Company holds as an essential concept the right of employees to proudly share their ideas and unique perspectives in an environment built on mutual respect, equity and inclusion. The Company is committed to diversity among its workforce, executive and senior management leadership teams, by reflecting the diversity of the communities in which the Company serves. The Company expects all of its leaders to lead with inclusion, diversity and equity.

During 2021, the Company published its first Inclusion & Diversity Report. The report shares the Company’s diversity strategies, practices, policies and programs from across the business and includes more than 100 data points related to building a culture of inclusion. The following graphic highlights the Company’s principal employee inclusion, diversity and equity metrics for 2021 based on its employee headcount as of January 1, 2022, and which are based on responses from employees who voluntarily self-reported this information to the Company.

During 2021, 85.6% of the Company’s hiring candidate pools were diverse. For this purpose, diversity refers to gender, race, ethnicity, disability and/or veteran/military status, based on voluntary, self-identified employee information.

The Company maintains active memberships with groups such as Hiring our Heroes, Military Spouse Employment Partnership, American Corporate Partners, CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, Disability:IN, Paradigm for Parity, and Out and Equal, to further enhance its ability to recruit and retain diverse employees. Among this year’s recognitions, the Company was designated as a 2021 Military Friendly® Top 10 Gold Employer and recognized by Military Times for its industry-leading efforts on hiring and supporting U.S. military veterans. The Company was also a top scorer in the 2021 Disability Equality Index for the third consecutive year and was recognized by U.S. Veterans Magazine as a veteran-friendly company and as an organization with a veteran-friendly supplier diversity program.

In keeping with the Company’s values, the Company does not tolerate discrimination, harassment or retaliation by or toward any employee, vendor, customer or other person in its workplace. All employees are required to complete anti-harassment, workplace respect and dignity, unconscious bias and inclusion and diversity training. In addition, annual Code of Ethics training is provided to all employees, which includes education on using the Company’s anonymous hotline for reporting potential Code of Ethics violations.

In 2021, the Company launched four employee business resource groups (“EBRGs”), which represent diverse employee demographics (Women, African American/Black, LGBTQ+ and Disabilities) throughout the Company. EBRGs offer opportunities for employees to share ideas and best practices, and to create measurable and long-lasting positive impacts on the Company’s culture. The Company’s Inclusion and Diversity Advisory Council oversees the formation, goals and actions of the EBRGs to support the Company’s inclusion diversity and equity priorities.

To further its commitment to inclusion, diversity and equity, and in response to feedback from employees about work-life balance, in 2021, the Company announced a new Inclusion Holiday Swap benefit, to allow the opportunity for all employees to swap a Company holiday with another day of their choosing that more closely reflects their personal values, beliefs or culture. In addition, the Company is evaluating the implementation of workforce diversity goals in certain of its compensation programs.

Total Rewards

Employees are considered the Company’s greatest assets and the Company views their overall well-being to be as important as their physical safety. American Water’s health and well-being programs aim for employees to go home in the same or better condition than when they came to work. Health and well-being programs are approached holistically by offering the following benefits, among others: medical, prescription, dental, vision, disability and life insurance coverage, as well as a health and wellness program and a menu of additional voluntary benefits. The Company’s Total Rewards programs are designed to reflect many aspects of employee health and well-being, cultivate an inclusive workforce and motivate, attract and retain talent to seek to achieve the Company’s strategic business priorities.

As part of Total Rewards, the Company provides a comprehensive compensation and benefit program designed to recognize the vital roles the Company’s employees play. Further, all of the Company’s employees, including those who are union-represented, 

22
participate in the Company’s Annual Performance Plan, to promote alignment in bonus compensation to the Company’s short-term performance goals. Moreover, all employees who average 30 hours or more per week receive full-time benefits. Approximately 90% of all benefit eligible employees are enrolled in the Company’s healthcare benefits. Full-time employees pay approximately 16% of the total cost of medical, dental and vision coverage. The Company offers its non-union employees who average 20 to 30 hours per week medical, dental and vision coverage at 50% of the total cost. Additional medical benefits include coverage for applied behavior analysis, autism treatment, transgender services and hearing aids, as well as a fertility assistance benefit to assist employees in building a family. The Company also offers additional employment benefits, including holiday, vacation and sick time, which are at levels generally greater than or equal to those offered by other companies in the utility industry. For example, the Company offers its employees up to two weeks of paid leave in connection with the birth, adoption or foster placement of a child, or to take care of a sick family member.

The Company believes that good emotional and mental health is fundamental, and offers a behavioral health benefit to assist employees and their families to maintain their well-being. Additionally, the Company offers an employee assistance program (EAP) that provides all employees and their eligible dependents with access to a variety of support resources free of charge. The EAP provides confidential support through its Work-Life Specialists to help individuals who are experiencing a variety of challenges, including financial, legal, family and emotional needs. The EAP provides guidance, resources and expert referrals based on an individual’s needs. In addition, the Company provides all employees and their families with access to an interactive online wellness program that supports and encourages a healthy lifestyle both at work and at home. In 2021, the Company enhanced its internal myWellness website to include additional tools and activities for employees, including customized programs and action cards tailored to an individual’s self-identified health needs.

Talent Development

The Company provides learning opportunities and work experiences to equip its employees with the tools, skills, and competencies they need to operate safely and effectively and to grow professionally. To this end, the Company has established an Employee Experience and Talent Development team to help develop and deploy programs that are designed to attract, motivate, develop and retain talented employees, and foster a learning culture. The Company requires every employee, including its union-represented employees, to complete a minimum of 25 hours of training each year (an increase in the 20-hour requirement for 2020). Approximately 98% of active full-time employees hired before October 1, 2021 met this requirement for 2021, with over 331,000 hours of total training completed during the year, including approximately 109,000 hours of safety training. In addition to required role-based training, managers assist employees to identify professional development opportunities to help them reach their full potential and grow their careers. Additionally, in 2021, approximately 58% of the Company’s internal employee transfers and promotions were diverse (defined as female, minority, disability, military, military spouse, and LGBTQ+ status, based on voluntary employee self-identification), which reflects the Company’s commitment to employee development and career growth as well as the Company’s focus on diversity, inclusion and equity, and a desire for its employees to reflect the communities in which it operates.

Developing talent and ensuring a pipeline to executive leadership is a critical priority for the Company. During 2021, the Company engaged in succession planning activities for the Company’s critical positions and executive leaders. These succession plans aid in providing continued leadership for the growth and future of the Company’s business, while also seeking to promote diversity, retention and development. In addition to succession of executive leadership roles, in 2022, the Company plans to focus on talent reviews, which will include identification of critical skill and competency areas, a focus on diverse emerging talent, and a discussion of strengths, gaps, and development plans. Talent reviews will be conducted for a select group of employees, including employees who are being assessed for senior leadership or other critical roles.

Employee Experience 

The Company’s employee value proposition (“EVP”) focuses on employee experience as an influencer of an employee’s opinions and emotional response about the Company as an employer. The Company continually seeks to shape and refine its employee experience, and therefore its EVP, by offering an inclusive employee culture, employee development opportunities and competitive compensation and benefits. In developing its current EVP, the Company identified components that it believes are important to its employees and then solicited and received feedback from over 400 Company employees on those components to understand better the aspects that they value from their employer. From this employee outreach, and as a part of its EVP, the Company developed weCare, which is comprised of the following five components: deeper connections, personal growth, shared purpose, flexibility and well-being.

Workforce Data

As of January 1, 2022, the Company had approximately 6,400 employees. For 2021, the Company’s employee turnover rate, which the Company defines as the ratio of the number of separated employees to the 12-month average headcount during 2021, was 13.1%, up from 7.4% in 2020. American Water seeks to reduce employee turnover by assessing its EVP and through its efforts to foster the Company’s employee experience.

23
As of January 1, 2022, approximately 47% of the Company’s workforce was represented by unions, which include 73 collective bargaining agreements with 14 different unions. Additionally, in 2022, the Company has begun to negotiate two new collective bargaining agreements, which would cover approximately 180 employees. During 2022, 21 of the Company’s collective bargaining agreements are set to expire in accordance with their terms and the Company expects to be able to negotiate these agreements during the year. The Company collaborates with union leadership on topics such as safety, customer, technology and employee benefits in forums such as the Joint Healthcare Committee, National Labor Management Committee and the annual Labor Management Conference.

Board Oversight

The Executive Development and Compensation Committee (“ED&CC”) of the Board of Directors establishes and reviews the Company’s overall compensation philosophy and oversees the compensation and benefits plans and programs for its executive officers. The ED&CC oversees the process of planning for executive officer succession. It also provides oversight of the Company’s inclusion, diversity and equity programs and initiatives. Further, the ED&CC is responsible for reviewing and assessing, at least annually, the Company’s culture and related culture engagement, its organizational and leadership development plans and programs, and its programs designed to identify, attract and retain high-potential employees.
