ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS

Investors should review carefully the following material risk factors and the other information contained in this report. The risks that the Ameren Companies face are not limited to those in this section. There may be further risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be material that may adversely affect the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of the Ameren Companies.

REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS

We are subject to extensive regulation of our businesses.

We are subject to federal, state, and local regulation. The extensive regulatory frameworks, some of which are more specifically identified in the following risk factors, regulate, among other matters, the electric and natural gas utility industries; the rate and cost structure of utilities, including an allowed ROE; the operation of nuclear power plants; the construction and operation of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities; the acquisition, disposal, depreciation and amortization of assets and facilities; the electric transmission system reliability; and wholesale and retail competition. In the planning and management of our operations, we must address the effects of existing and proposed laws and regulations and potential changes in our regulatory frameworks, including initiatives by federal and state legislatures, RTOs, utility regulators, and taxing authorities. Significant changes in the nature of the regulation of our businesses, including expiration or discontinuation of, or significant changes to, existing regulatory mechanisms, could require changes to our business planning and management of our businesses and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Failure to obtain adequate rates or regulatory approvals in a timely manner; failure to obtain necessary licenses or permits from regulatory authorities; the impact of new or modified laws, regulations, standards, interpretations, or other legal requirements; or increased compliance costs could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

The electric and natural gas rates that we are allowed to charge are determined through regulatory proceedings, which are subject to intervention and appeal. Rates are also subject to legislative actions, which are largely outside of our control. Certain events could prevent us from recovering our costs in a timely manner or from earning adequate returns on our investments.

The rates that we are allowed to charge for our utility services significantly influence our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated. The utility rates charged to customers are determined by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and the FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, customer intervention, and economic conditions, as well as social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding customer rates are largely outside of our control. We are exposed to regulatory lag and cost disallowances to varying degrees by jurisdiction, which, if unmitigated, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Rate orders are also subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that we will ultimately be allowed to charge for our services. From time to time, our regulators may approve trackers, riders, or other recovery mechanisms that allow electric or natural gas rates to be adjusted without a traditional regulatory rate review. These mechanisms could be changed or terminated.

Ameren Missouri’s electric and natural gas utility rates and Ameren Illinois’ natural gas utility rates are typically established in regulatory proceedings that take up to 11 months to complete. Ameren Missouri’s electric and natural gas utility rates established in those proceedings are primarily based on historical costs and revenues. Ameren Illinois’ natural gas rates established in those proceedings are based on 

20
estimated future costs and revenues. Thus, the rates that we are allowed to charge for utility services may not match our actual costs at any given time.

Rates include an allowed return on investments established by the regulator, including a return at the applicable WACC on rate base, and an amount for income taxes based on the currently applicable statutory income tax rates and amortization associated with excess deferred income taxes. Although rate regulation is premised on providing an opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on rate base, there can be no assurance that the regulator will determine that our costs were prudently incurred or that the regulatory process will result in rates that will produce full recovery of such costs or provide for an opportunity to earn a reasonable return on those investments. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois, and the utility industry generally, have an increased need for cost recovery, primarily driven by capital investments, which is likely to continue in the future. The resulting increase to the revenue requirement needed to recover such costs and earn a return on investments could result in more frequent regulatory rate reviews and requests for cost recovery mechanisms. Additionally, increasing rates could result in regulatory or legislative actions, as well as competitive or political pressures, all of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Ameren Illinois expects to use the IEIMA performance-based formula ratemaking framework to establish annual customer rates effective through 2023. Effective for rates beginning in 2024, Ameren Illinois will establish electric distribution rates through either a traditional regulatory rate review or an MYRP. As a result of its participation in the IEIMA performance-based formula ratemaking, Ameren Illinois’ ROE for its electric distribution service through 2023 and its electric energy-efficiency investments is directly correlated to yields on United States Treasury bonds. Additionally, Ameren Illinois is subject to certain performance standards. With respect to its natural gas delivery service business, unless extended, Ameren Illinois’ QIP will expire after December 2023.

Ameren Illinois expects to continue to use the current IEIMA performance-based formula ratemaking framework to establish annual customer rates effective through 2023 and reconcile the related revenue requirements through an IEIMA reconciliation. The IETL resulted in changes to the regulatory framework applicable to Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business by giving Ameren Illinois the option to file an MYRP with the ICC by mid-January 2023, with rates effective beginning in 2024, among other things. Subject to a constructive outcome regarding the ICC’s determination of performance metrics, Ameren Illinois anticipates filing an MYRP for rates effective beginning in 2024. An MYRP would establish rates for a four-year period, and Ameren Illinois has the option to file for an MYRP every four years. For rates effective beginning in 2024, Ameren Illinois will be required to establish future rates through a traditional regulatory rate review or an MYRP with the ICC, which might result in rates that do not produce a full or timely recovery of costs or provide for an adequate return on investments and would expose Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business to the risks described in the immediately preceding risk factor. By law, Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution revenues are decoupled from sales volumes regardless of the process used to establish electric distribution rates, which ensures that the electric distribution revenues authorized in a regulatory rate review are not affected by changes in sales volumes. Ameren Illinois also has an electric energy-efficiency program rider, which includes a return at the applicable WACC on its program investments, that is subject to performance-based formula ratemaking. The ICC annually reviews Ameren Illinois’ rate filings for reasonableness and prudency. If the ICC were to conclude that Ameren Illinois’ costs were not prudently incurred, the ICC would disallow recovery of such costs.

The allowed ROE under the IEIMA and electric energy-efficiency formula ratemaking recovery mechanisms is based on the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds plus 580 basis points. Therefore, Ameren Illinois’ annual ROE for its electric distribution business is directly correlated to the yields on such bonds, which are outside of Ameren Illinois’ control. A 50 basis point change in the annual average of the monthly yields of the 30-year United States Treasury bonds would result in an estimated $11 million change in Ameren’s and Ameren Illinois’ annual net income, based on Ameren Illinois’ 2022 projected year-end rate base, including electric energy-efficiency investments.

Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business is also subject to performance standards. Failure to achieve the standards would result in a reduction in the company’s allowed ROE calculated under the formula ratemaking recovery mechanisms. The performance standards applicable to electric distribution service under the IEIMA include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages, a reduction in the number of estimated bills, a reduction of consumption from inactive meters, and a reduction in bad debt expense. The allowed ROE for electric distribution service may be decreased for penalties up to 38 basis points in 2022 and up to 10 basis points in 2023 if these performance standards are not met. The allowed ROE on energy-efficiency investments can be increased or decreased up to 200 basis points, depending on the achievement of annual energy savings goals. Any adjustments to the allowed ROE for energy-efficiency investments will depend on annual performance for a historical period relative to energy savings goals. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, there were no performance-related basis point adjustments that materially affected financial results. With respect to the MYRP, the ICC-determined ROE would be subject to annual adjustments during the four-year period based on certain performance metrics, with aggregate symmetrical performance-based ROE incentives and penalties ranging from 20 to 60 basis points annually.

21
While the ICC has approved a plan for Ameren Illinois to invest approximately $100 million per year in electric energy-efficiency programs through 2025, the ICC has the ability to reduce the amount of electric energy-efficiency savings goals in the future plan program years if there are insufficient cost-effective programs available, which could reduce the investments in electric energy-efficiency programs.

The QIP provides Ameren Illinois with recovery of, and a return on, qualifying natural gas infrastructure investments that are placed in service between regulatory rate reviews. Infrastructure investments under the QIP earn a return at the applicable WACC. Ameren Illinois’ QIP is subject to a rate impact limitation of a cumulative 4% per year since the most recent delivery service rate order, with no single year exceeding 5.5%. If the rate impact limitation was met in a particular year, the amount of rate base causing the QIP rate to exceed the limitation would be exposed to regulatory lag until a year when that amount could be recovered under QIP or is added to rate base as a part of a regulatory rate review. Upon issuance of a natural gas delivery service rate order, QIP rate base is transferred to base rates and the QIP is reset to zero. Without legislative action, the QIP will expire after December 2023. If Ameren Illinois is unable to recover investments under the QIP or there is no other regulatory change, Ameren Illinois will be subject to increased regulatory lag on its natural gas infrastructure investments that are placed in service between regulatory rate reviews, which could adversely affect Ameren’s and Ameren Illinois’ investment plans and results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

As a result of the election to use the PISA, Ameren Missouri’s electric rates are subject to a rate cap. Additionally, Ameren Missouri’s investment plan assumes use of PISA through December 2028, which is subject to MoPSC approval that has not yet been requested.

As a result of Ameren Missouri’s election to use the PISA, its rate increases are limited to a 2.85% compound annual growth rate in the average overall customer rate per kilowatthour, based on the electric rates that became effective in April 2017, less half of the annual savings from the TCJA that was passed on to customers as approved in a July 2018 MoPSC order. Both the rate cap and the PISA election are effective through December 2023, unless Ameren Missouri requests and receives MoPSC approval of an extension through December 2028.

Increased capital investments and operating costs could cause customer rates to exceed the rate cap. In addition, a decrease in off-system sales, which are included in net energy costs within the FAC, could also contribute to customer rates exceeding the rate cap. Off-system sales are affected by generation availability, which is affected by planned and unplanned outages at Ameren Missouri’s energy centers, curtailment of generation resulting from unfavorable economic conditions, the addition of new generation sources, and retirements of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers, among other things. If rate changes from the FAC or the RESRAM riders would cause rates to temporarily exceed the 2.85% rate cap, the overage would be deferred for future recovery in the next regulatory rate review; however, rates established in such regulatory rate review would be subject to the rate cap. Any deferred overages approved for recovery would be recovered over a period of 20 years following approval of amounts in a regulatory rate review. Excluding customer rates under the MEEIA rider, which are not subject to the rate cap, Ameren Missouri would incur a penalty equal to the amount of deferred overage that would cause customer rates to exceed the 2.85% rate cap. A penalty incurred as the result of exceeding the rate cap could adversely affect Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Ameren Missouri’s planned capital expenditures of up to $9.2 billion from 2022 through 2026 are based on the assumption of continued constructive regulatory frameworks, including an assumption that Ameren Missouri requests and receives MoPSC approval of an extension of the PISA through December 2028. If Ameren Missouri does not obtain approval to use the PISA through December 2028, it could adversely affect Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s investment plans and results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

We are subject to various environmental laws. Significant capital expenditures may be required to achieve and to maintain compliance with these environmental laws. Failure to comply with these laws could result in the closing of facilities, alterations to the manner in which these facilities operate, increased operating costs, delays and increased costs of building new facilities, or exposure to fines and liabilities.

Our electric generation, transmission, and distribution and natural gas distribution and storage operations must comply with a variety of statutes and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety including permitting programs implemented via federal, state, and local authorities. Such environmental laws address air emissions; discharges to water bodies; the storage, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste materials; siting and land use requirements; and potential ecological impacts. Complex and lengthy processes are required to obtain and renew approvals, permits, and licenses for new, existing, or modified facilities. Additionally, the use and handling of various chemicals or hazardous materials require release prevention plans and emergency response procedures. Further, we are subject to risks from changing or conflicting interpretations of existing laws, modification to existing laws, new laws, and new or modified permit terms.

We are also subject to liability under environmental laws that address the remediation of environmental contamination on property currently or formerly owned by us or by our predecessors, as well as property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. Such properties include MGP sites and third-party sites, such as landfills. Additionally, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws against us. They could allege injury from exposure to hazardous materials, allege a failure to comply with environmental laws, seek to compel remediation of environmental contamination, or seek to recover damages resulting from that contamination.

22
Environmental regulations have a significant impact on the electric utility industry and compliance with these regulations could be costly for Ameren Missouri, which operates coal-fired power plants. As of December 31, 2021, Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers represented 10% and 20% of Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s rate base, respectively. Clean Air Act regulations that apply to the electric utility industry include the NSPS, the CSAPR, the MATS, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which are subject to periodic review for certain pollutants. Collectively, these regulations cover a variety of pollutants, such as SO2, particulate matter, NOx, mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases, and CO2 emissions from new power plants. Regulations implementing the Clean Water Act govern both intake and discharges of water and may require evaluation of the ecological and biological impact of our operations and could require modifications to water intake structures or more stringent limitations on wastewater discharges. Depending upon the scope of modifications ultimately required by state regulators, these capital expenditures could be significant. The management and disposal of coal ash is regulated under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the CCR Rule, which require the closure of our surface impoundments at Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers. The individual or combined effects of existing and new environmental regulations could result in significant capital expenditures, increased operating costs, or the closure or alteration of operations at some of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers.

In January 2011, the United States Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, filed a complaint against Ameren Missouri in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri alleging that in performing projects at its coal-fired Rush Island Energy Center in 2007 and 2010, Ameren Missouri violated provisions of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law. In January 2017, the district court issued a liability ruling against Ameren Missouri and, in September 2019, entered a remedy order. That remedy order included a requirement to install a flue gas desulfurization system at the Rush Island Energy Center, which was upheld through an appeals process by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in the fourth quarter of 2021. Based on its assessment of available legal, operational and regulatory alternatives, Ameren Missouri has determined not to further appeal the court rulings and, in December 2021, filed a motion with the district court to modify the remedy order to allow the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center in advance of its previously expected useful life in lieu of installing a flue gas desulfurization system. The district court is under no deadline to issue a ruling revising the remedy order. In January 2022, the MISO completed a preliminary assessment regarding potential impacts of the retirement to the regional electric power system, which indicated transmission upgrades and voltage support would be needed in advance of the retirement to address reliability concerns. In February 2022, Ameren Missouri expects to formally notify the MISO of its intent to retire the Rush Island Energy Center. Upon receipt of the formal notification, the MISO will conduct a final reliability assessment. The MISO must also separately approve the specific upgrades and transmission support required to address reliability concerns noted in the assessment. Related to this matter, in February 2022, the MoPSC issued an order directing the MoPSC staff to review Ameren Missouri’s planned accelerated retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center, including potential impacts on the reliability and cost of Ameren Missouri’s service to its customers, Ameren Missouri’s plans to mitigate the customer impacts of the accelerated retirement, and the prudence of Ameren Missouri’s actions and decisions with regard to the Rush Island Energy Center, among other things. The MoPSC staff is under no deadline to complete this review. As of December 31, 2021, the Rush Island Energy Center had a net plant balance of approximately $0.6 billion and a rate base of approximately $0.4 billion. In addition, Ameren Missouri expects to file an update to the 2020 IRP with the MoPSC in the first half of 2022 to reflect the planned acceleration of the retirement of the Rush Island Energy Center from 2039, the retirement year for the facility as reflected in the 2020 IRP and reflected in depreciation rates approved by the December 2021 MoPSC electric rate order. Ameren Missouri is unable to predict the ultimate resolution of this matter; however, such resolution could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri.

The EPA’s Affordable Clean Energy Rule repealed the Clean Power Plan and replaced it with a new rule that established emission guidelines for states to follow in developing plans to limit CO2 emissions and identified certain efficiency measures as the best system of emission reduction for coal-fired electric generating units. In January 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, and ruled that the EPA had the discretion to consider emission reduction measures that include efficiency measures and generation shifting to lower carbon emissions. The United States Supreme Court agreed to review the court of appeals’ ruling and oral arguments will occur in February 2022 with a decision expected by mid-2022. A decision by the United States Supreme Court could impact the EPA’s development of new regulations to address carbon emissions from coal- and natural gas-fired electric generating units. At this time, Ameren Missouri cannot predict the outcome of the legal challenge or future rulemakings. As such, any impact on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren and Ameren Missouri is uncertain.

The EPA’s CCR Rule establishes requirements for the management and disposal of CCR from coal-fired power plants and will result in the closure of surface impoundments at Ameren Missouri’s energy centers. In January 2022, Ameren Missouri received notice of a proposed determination by the EPA that it has rejected Ameren Missouri’s requests to extend the timeline for operating certain impoundments located at the Sioux and Meramec energy centers. Compliance with the CCR Rule’s requirements for closure of the impoundments would be required 135 days after the EPA issues a final determination, which Ameren Missouri expects to be issued in the spring of 2022. If Ameren Missouri was no longer able to use the surface impoundments at the Sioux or Meramec energy centers, Ameren Missouri would not be able to operate the energy centers unless an alternative for handling the CCR material is in place. Ameren Missouri plans to retire the Meramec Energy Center in 2022, and is accelerating its construction plans to build a CCR Rule-compliant impoundment at the Sioux Energy Center to allow for continued operations. Additionally, Ameren Missouri is seeking a reliability determination from the MISO, which, if granted, would extend the deadline to comply with the requirement to close the impoundments and allow the energy centers to operate.

23
The IETL established emission standards that became effective in September 2021. Ameren Missouri's natural gas-fired energy centers in Illinois will be subject to limits on emissions, including CO2 and NOx, equal to their unit-specific average emissions from 2018 through 2020, for any rolling twelve-month period beginning October 1, 2021, through 2029. Further reductions to emissions limits will become effective between 2030 and 2040, which could limit the operations of Ameren Missouri's five natural gas-fired energy centers located in the state of Illinois, and will result in the closure of one or more energy centers earlier than anticipated. These energy centers are utilized to support peak loads. Subject to conditions in the IETL, these energy centers may be allowed to exceed the emissions limits in order to maintain reliability of electric utility service as necessary. Ameren Missouri is reviewing the emission standards and the effect they may have on its generation strategy, including any increases in capital expenditures or operating costs, and changes to the useful lives of the five natural gas-fired energy centers. Ameren Missouri expects to file an update to the 2020 IRP with the MoPSC in the first half of 2022 to reflect, among other things, the impact of these new emissions standards.

Ameren and Ameren Missouri have incurred, and expect to incur, significant costs with respect to environmental compliance and site remediation. New or revised environmental regulations, enforcement initiatives, or legislation could result in a significant increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, decreased revenues, penalties or fines, reduced operations or closure of some of Ameren Missouri’s coal-and natural gas-fired energy centers, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity and financing needs, and higher financing costs. Actions required to ensure that Ameren Missouri’s facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws could be prohibitively expensive for Ameren Missouri if the costs are not fully recovered through rates. Environmental laws could require Ameren Missouri to close or to alter significantly the operations of its energy centers. If Ameren Missouri requests recovery of capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance through rates, the MoPSC could deny recovery of all or a portion of these costs, prevent timely recovery, or make changes to the regulatory framework in an effort to minimize rate volatility and customer rate increases. Capital expenditures and costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might result in Ameren Missouri closing coal-fired energy centers earlier than planned. If these costs are not recoverable through base rates or other regulatory mechanisms, it could lead to an impairment of assets and reduced revenues. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial positions, and liquidity.

We are subject to business and financial risks related to the impact of climate change legislation, regulation, and emission reduction goals.

There is increasing concern and activism among various external stakeholders, both nationally and internationally, about climate change, including public concerns about the potential environmental impacts from the combustion of fossil fuels, as well as pressure from public interest groups regarding limiting the use of natural gas. State and federal authorities, including the United States Congress, have considered initiatives to further restrict greenhouse gases to address global climate change. Additionally, international agreements could lead to future federal or state legislation or regulations. In 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reached consensus among approximately 190 nations on an agreement, known as the Paris Agreement, that establishes a framework for greenhouse gas mitigation actions by all countries, with a goal of holding the increase in global average temperature to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and an aspiration to limit the increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Biden administration has announced a new policy commitment regarding a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the United States, but rulemaking to achieve such reductions has not yet been implemented. Actions taken to implement the Paris Agreement could result in future additional greenhouse gas reduction requirements in the United States. In addition, the Biden administration has announced plans to implement new climate change programs, including potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions targeting the utility industry.

As a result of our diverse fuel portfolio, our emissions of greenhouse gases vary among our energy centers, but coal-fired power plants are significant sources of CO2 emissions. Future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of, or impose taxation on, greenhouse gases could result in a significant increase in capital expenditures and operating costs, decreased revenues, penalties or fines, or reduced operations of some of Ameren Missouri’s coal- and natural gas-fired energy centers, which, in turn, could lead to increased liquidity and financing needs, and higher financing costs. Moreover, to the extent Ameren Missouri requests recovery of these costs through rates, its regulators might deny some or all of, or defer timely recovery of, these costs. Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations related to climate change might force Ameren Missouri to close some coal-fired energy centers earlier than planned, which could lead to possible loss on abandonment and reduced revenues. As a result, mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Ameren established a goal of achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Ameren is also targeting a 50% CO2 emission reduction by 2030 and an 85% reduction by 2040 from the 2005 levels. Achievement of these goals is dependent on many factors, including the pace and extent of development and deployment of low- to zero-carbon energy technologies and carbon capture technologies, and the cost of those technologies; natural gas prices; new transmission infrastructure; and constructive energy policies, including those that address investment in energy infrastructure, global climate change, incentives for clean energy technologies, and environmental regulations. Additional factors associated with operational risks for the construction and acquisition of electric and natural gas infrastructure may also affect the achievement of these goals, as further discussed below. The strategy to achieve these goals also relies on continuing to pursue a diverse portfolio including low-carbon and carbon-free resources and energy-efficiency resources; continuing to participate in efforts to help advance the development of technologies such as carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration; the use of hydrogen fuel for electric production and 

24
energy storage, next generation nuclear, and large-scale long-cycle battery energy storage; and constructively engaging with legislators, regulators, investors, customers, and other stakeholders to support outcomes leading to a net-zero future.

We are subject to federal regulatory compliance and proceedings, which could result in increasing costs and the potential for regulatory penalties and other sanctions.

We are subject to FERC regulations, rules, and orders, including standards required by the NERC. As owners and operators of bulk power transmission systems and electric energy centers, we are subject to mandatory NERC reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards. In addition, our natural gas transmission, distribution, and storage facilities systems are subject to PHMSA rules and regulations. Compliance with these reliability standards, rules, and regulations may subject us to higher operating costs and may result in increased capital expenditures. We may also incur higher operating costs to comply with potential new regulations issued by these regulatory bodies. If we were found not to be in compliance with these mandatory NERC reliability standards, PHMSA rules and regulations, or FERC regulations, rules, and orders, we could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. The FERC can impose civil penalties of approximately $1.4 million per violation per day for violation of its regulations, rules, and orders, including mandatory NERC reliability standards. The FERC also conducts audits and reviews of Ameren Missouri’s, Ameren Illinois’, and ATXI’s accounting records to assess the accuracy of their respective formula ratemaking process, and it can require refunds to customers for previously billed amounts, with interest.

OPERATIONAL RISKS

The construction and acquisition of, and capital improvements to, electric and natural gas utility infrastructure, along with Ameren Missouri’s ability to implement its Smart Energy Plan, which is aligned with its 2020 IRP, involve substantial risks.

We expect to make significant capital expenditures to maintain and improve our electric and natural gas utility infrastructure and to comply with existing environmental regulations. We estimate that we will invest up to $18.0 billion (Ameren Missouri – up to $9.2 billion; Ameren Illinois – up to $8.6 billion; ATXI – up to $0.2 billion) of capital expenditures from 2022 through 2026. For additional information on these estimates, see Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Expenditures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report. Investments in Ameren’s rate-regulated operations are expected to be recoverable from customers, but they are subject to prudence reviews and are exposed to regulatory lag of varying degrees by jurisdiction.

Our ability to complete construction projects successfully within projected estimates, including schedule, performance, and/or cost, and to implement Ameren Missouri’s Smart Energy Plan, which may include acquisition of generation facilities after they are constructed, is contingent upon many factors and subject to substantial risks. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: project management expertise; escalating costs and/or shortages for labor, materials, and equipment, including changes to tariffs on materials; the ability of suppliers, contractors, and developers to meet contractual commitments timely; changes in the scope and timing of projects; the ability to obtain required regulatory, project, and permit approvals; the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements, and transmission connections at an acceptable cost in a timely fashion; unsatisfactory performance by the projects when completed; the inability to earn an adequate return on invested capital; the ability to raise capital on reasonable terms; and other events beyond our control, including construction delays due to weather. With respect to the transition of Ameren Missouri’s generation fleet and achievement of the carbon emission reduction targets outlined in the 2020 IRP, factors also include MoPSC approval for the retirement of energy centers and new or continued customer energy-efficiency programs; the ability to enter into build-transfer agreements for renewable generation and acquire that generation at a reasonable cost; levels of customer participation in the energy-efficiency programs; the cost and commercial availability of wind, solar, and other renewable generation and storage technologies; the ability to qualify for, and use, federal production or investment tax credits; changes in environmental laws or requirements, including those related to carbon emissions; and energy prices and demand.

Any of these risks could result in higher costs, the inability to complete anticipated projects, or facility closures, and could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities are subject to operational risks.

Our financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. Operation of electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities involves many risks, including:

•facility shutdowns due to operator error, or a failure of equipment or processes;

•longer-than-anticipated maintenance outages;

•failures of equipment that can result in unanticipated liabilities or unplanned outages, such as the unplanned outage resulting from non-nuclear operating issues related to the Callaway Energy Center’s generator that occurred from December 2020 to August 2021;

•aging infrastructure that may require significant expenditures to operate and maintain;

25
•an energy center that might not be permitted to continue to operate if pollution control equipment is not installed by prescribed deadlines or does not perform as expected;

•lack of adequate water required for cooling plant operations;

•labor disputes;

•disruptions in the delivery of electricity to our customers;

•inability to maintain reliability of our electric utility services as coal-fired energy centers are retired and renewable energy generation is placed in service;

•suppliers and contractors who do not perform as required under their contracts;

•failure of other operators’ facilities and the effect of that failure on our electric system and customers;

•inability to comply with regulatory or permit requirements, including those relating to environmental laws;

•handling, storage, and disposition of CCR;

•unusual or adverse weather conditions or other natural disasters, including those that may result from climate change, such as severe storms, droughts, floods, tornadoes, earthquakes, icing, sustained high or low temperatures, such as the extremely low temperatures experienced in mid-February 2021, solar flares, and electromagnetic pulses;

•the level of wind and solar resources;

•inability to operate wind generation facilities at full capacity resulting from requirements to protect natural resources, including wildlife;

•the occurrence of catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, acts of sabotage or terrorism, civil unrest, pandemic health events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other similar events;

•accidents that might result in injury or loss of life, extensive property damage, or environmental damage;

•ineffective vegetation management programs;

•cybersecurity risks, including loss of operational control of Ameren Missouri’s energy centers and our transmission and distribution systems and loss of data, including sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information, through insider or outsider actions;

•limitations on amounts of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with operating our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities;

•inability to implement or maintain information systems;

•failure to keep pace with and the ability to adapt to rapid technological change; and

•other unanticipated operations and maintenance expenses and liabilities.

The foregoing risks could affect the controls and operations of our facilities or impede our ability to meet regulatory requirements, which could increase operating costs, increase our capital requirements and costs, reduce our revenues, or have an adverse effect on our liquidity.

Ameren Missouri’s ability to obtain an adequate supply of coal could limit operation of its coal-fired energy centers.

Ameren Missouri owns and operates coal-fired energy centers. About 98% of Ameren Missouri’s coal is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, which has a limited number of suppliers. Deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail congestion, staffing and equipment issues, infrastructure maintenance, derailments, weather, and supplier financial hardship. Coal suppliers in the Powder River Basin are experiencing financial hardship because of a decrease in demand resulting from increased natural gas and renewable energy generation, and the impact of environmental regulations and concerns related to coal-fired generation. These financial hardships have resulted in bankruptcy filings by certain coal suppliers in recent years. As of December 31, 2021, coal inventories at the Sioux and Rush Island energy centers were near targeted levels, and coal inventories at the Labadie Energy Center were below targeted levels due to transportation disruptions in 2021. Ameren Missouri is actively managing inventories at the Meramec Energy Center in preparation for its expected 2022 retirement. However, additional disruptions in the delivery of coal, failure of our coal suppliers to provide adequate quantities or quality of coal, or lack of adequate inventories of coal, including low-sulfur coal used to comply with environmental regulations, could have adverse effects on Ameren Missouri’s electric generation operations. If Ameren Missouri is unable to obtain an adequate supply of coal under existing agreements, it may be required to purchase coal at higher prices or be forced to reduce generation at its coal-fired energy centers, which could adversely affect Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. 

Ameren Missouri’s ownership and operation of a nuclear energy center creates business, financial, and waste disposal risks.

Ameren Missouri’s ownership of the Callaway Energy Center subjects it to risks associated with nuclear generation, including:

•potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from radiological releases associated with the operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling, and disposal of radioactive materials;

•continued uncertainty regarding the federal government’s plan to permanently store spent nuclear fuel and, as a result, the need to provide for long-term storage of spent nuclear fuel at the Callaway Energy Center;

•limitations on the amounts and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the Callaway Energy Center or other United States nuclear facilities;

26
•uncertainties about contingencies and retrospective premium assessments relating to claims at the Callaway Energy Center or any other United States nuclear facilities;

•public and governmental concerns about the safety and adequacy of security at nuclear facilities;

•limited availability of fuel supply and our reliance on licensed fuel assemblies from the one NRC-licensed supplier of Callaway Energy Center’s assemblies;

•costly and extended outages for scheduled or unscheduled maintenance and refueling, such as the unplanned outage resulting from non-nuclear operating issues related to the Callaway Energy Center’s generator that occurred from December 2020 to August 2021;

•uncertainties about the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear facilities at the end of their licensed lives;

•the adverse effect of poor market performance and other economic factors on the asset values of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and the corresponding increase, upon MoPSC approval, in customer rates to fund the estimated decommissioning costs; and

•potential adverse effects of a natural disaster, acts of sabotage or terrorism, including a cyber attack, or any accident leading to a radiological release.

The NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety requirements for nuclear facilities. In the event of noncompliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines or to shut down a unit, or both, depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Revised safety requirements promulgated from time to time by the NRC could necessitate substantial capital expenditures at the Callaway Energy Center. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could adversely affect Ameren’s and Ameren Missouri’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation of any domestic nuclear unit and could also cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or requirements on the industry, which could increase costs and result in additional capital expenditures. While the Callaway Energy Center is in compliance with the current NRC standards relating to seismic design and risk, these standards also require Ameren Missouri to address periodic changes to seismic hazard data and evaluation methods for the impact of an earthquake on its Callaway Energy Center due to its proximity to a fault line, which could require seismic risk evaluation updates and installation of additional capital equipment.

Our natural gas distribution and storage activities involve numerous risks that may result in accidents and increased operating costs.

Inherent in our natural gas distribution and storage activities are a variety of hazards and operating risks, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems and cybersecurity risks, which could cause substantial financial losses, including fines and penalties. In addition, these hazards could result in serious injury, loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmental impacts, and impairment of our operations, which in turn could lead us to incur substantial losses. The location of distribution mains and storage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, business centers, industrial sites, and other public gathering places, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. A major domestic incident involving natural gas distribution, and storage systems could result in additional capital expenditures and/or increased operations and maintenance expenses for us and increased regulation of natural gas utilities. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Significant portions of our electric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities and natural gas transmission and distribution facilities are aging. This aging infrastructure may require significant additional maintenance or replacement. Ameren Missouri could be adversely affected if it is unable to recover the remaining investment, if any, and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs.

Our aging infrastructure may pose risks to system reliability and expose us to expedited or unplanned significant capital expenditures and operating costs. All of Ameren Missouri’s coal-fired energy centers were constructed prior to 1978, and the Callaway Energy Center began operating in 1984. The age of these energy centers increases the risks of unplanned outages, reduced generation output, and higher maintenance expense. Further, Ameren Missouri would be adversely affected if the MoPSC does not allow recovery of the remaining investment and decommissioning costs associated with the retirement of an energy center, as well as the ability to earn a return on that remaining investment and those decommissioning costs. In addition, as discussed above, Ameren Missouri expects the retirement date of its Rush Island Energy Center to be accelerated from the date reflected in depreciation rates approved in the December 2021 MoPSC electric rate order. Aging transmission and distribution facilities are more prone to failure than new facilities, which results in higher maintenance expense and the need to replace these facilities with new infrastructure. Even when the system is properly maintained, its reliability may ultimately deteriorate and negatively affect our ability to serve our customers, which could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight. The frequency and duration of customer outages are among the IEIMA performance standards. Any failure to achieve these standards will result in a reduction in Ameren Illinois’ allowed ROE on electric distribution assets. The higher maintenance costs associated with aging infrastructure and capital expenditures for new or replacement infrastructure could cause additional rate volatility for our customers, resistance by our regulators to allow customer rate increases, and/or regulatory lag in some of our jurisdictions, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

27
Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, technological advances, and other factors could reduce energy demand from our customers.

Without a regulatory mechanism to ensure recovery, declines in energy usage could result in an under-recovery of our revenue requirement or an increase in our customer rates, as the revenue requirement would be spread over less sales volumes, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. Such declines could occur due to a number of factors, including:

•customer energy-efficiency programs that are designed to reduce energy demand;

•energy-efficiency efforts by customers not related to our energy-efficiency programs;

•increased customer use of distributed generation sources, such as solar panels and other technologies, which have become more cost-competitive, with decreasing costs expected in the future, as well as the use of energy storage technologies; and

•macroeconomic factors resulting in low economic growth or contraction within our service territories, which could reduce energy demand.

Decreased use of our generation, transmission, and distribution services might result in stranded costs, which ultimately might not be recovered through rates, and therefore, could lead to an impairment or abandonment of assets.

FINANCIAL, ECONOMIC, AND MARKET RISKS

Ameren’s holding company structure could limit its ability to pay common stock dividends and to service its debt obligations.

Ameren is a holding company; therefore, its primary assets are its investments in the common stock of its subsidiaries, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI. As a result, Ameren’s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends on the earnings of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to Ameren. Similarly, Ameren’s ability to service its debt obligations is dependent upon the earnings of its operating subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings and other payments, including payments of principal and interest under affiliate indebtedness. The payment of dividends to Ameren by its subsidiaries in turn depends on their results of operations, and other items affecting retained earnings, and available cash. Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for payments required pursuant to the terms of affiliate borrowing arrangements and cash payments under the tax allocation agreement) to Ameren. Certain financing agreements, corporate organizational documents, and certain statutory and regulatory requirements may impose restrictions on the ability of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and ATXI to transfer funds to Ameren in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.

Significant increases in prices of commodities, labor, services, materials, and supplies and other costs, including costs associated with our defined benefit retirement and postretirement plans, health care plans, and other employee benefits, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

A part of our core strategy focuses on disciplined cost management, including prudently monitoring all of our expenses. However, we have observed and expect future inflationary pressures related to prices of commodities, labor, services, materials, and supplies and other costs, including in the areas of health care and pension costs. These inflationary pressures could impact our ability to control costs, to make substantial investments in our businesses, to recover costs and investments, to earn our allowed ROEs within frameworks established by our regulators, and/or to maintain affordability of our services for our customers. Significant increases in our costs could increase our financing needs and otherwise adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

Related to benefits, Ameren has defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees and has postretirement benefit plans covering non-union employees hired before October 2015 and union employees hired before January 2020. Assumptions related to future costs, returns on investments, interest rates, timing of employee retirements, and mortality, as well as other actuarial matters, have a significant impact on our customers’ rates and our plan funding requirements. Ameren’s total pension and postretirement benefit plans were overfunded by $717 million as of December 31, 2021. Ameren expects to fund its pension plans at a level equal to the greater of the pension cost or the legally required minimum contribution. Based on its assumptions at December 31, 2021, its investment performance in 2021, and its pension funding policy, Ameren, Ameren Missouri, and Ameren Illinois do not expect to make material contributions in the aggregate over the next five years. These estimated contributions may change based on actual investment performance, changes in interest rates, changes in our assumptions, changes in government regulations, and any voluntary contributions. In addition to the costs of our pension plans, the costs of providing health care benefits to our employees and retirees have increased in recent years. We believe that our employee benefit costs, including costs of health care plans for our employees and former employees, will continue to rise. Future legislative changes related to health care could also significantly change our benefit programs and costs.

28
GENERAL RISKS

Our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the international public health emergency associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity. While our electric sales volumes, excluding the estimated effects of weather and customer energy-efficiency programs, increased in 2021, compared to 2020, and total sales volume levels were more comparable to pre-pandemic levels, there has been a shift in sales volumes by customer class, with an increase in residential sales, and a decrease in commercial and industrial sales. The continued effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity in subsequent periods will depend on its severity and longevity, future regulatory or legislative actions with respect thereto, and the resulting impact on business, economic, and capital market conditions. In addition, although restrictions on social activities and nonessential businesses implemented in our service territories in 2020 have been relaxed, additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, economic activity has been disrupted in the service territories of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois.

The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to affect total electric sales volumes and sales by customer class. Pursuant to the PISA, Ameren Missouri’s electric rates are limited to a 2.85% rate cap. Long-term declines in sales volumes, along with increased capital investments and operating costs, could result in Ameren Missouri’s inability to recover amounts exceeding the rate cap. While the revenues from Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business, residential and small nonresidential customers of Ameren Illinois’ natural gas distribution business, and Ameren Illinois’ and ATXI’s electric transmission businesses are decoupled from changes in sales volumes, earnings at Ameren Missouri and those associated with Ameren Illinois’ large nonresidential natural gas customers are exposed to such changes.

Our customers’ payment for our services has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a decrease to cash from operations. For most of the period from March 2020 through June 2021, the ICC limited disconnection activities and late fees for customer nonpayment to varying degrees based on customer class. A March 2021 ICC order also required Ameren Illinois to offer deferred payment arrangements extending to 18 months to all residential customers through June 2021. Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution and natural gas distribution businesses have bad debt riders, which provide for recovery of bad debt write-offs, net of any subsequent recoveries. Ameren Missouri does not have a bad debt rider or tracker, and thus its earnings are exposed to increases in bad debt expense, absent regulatory relief. However, Ameren Missouri has not experienced and does not expect a material impact to earnings from increases in bad debt expense.

In addition, suppliers and contractors may not perform as provided under their contracts. This could cause delays in construction projects, or the performance of necessary maintenance to our electric and natural gas infrastructure, which could lead to failures of equipment that can result in unanticipated liabilities or unplanned outages. Delays in our construction projects could also result in reduced planned capital expenditures and decreased rate base growth.

Also, our businesses depend on skilled professional and technical employees. Our operations could be adversely affected if a large portion of our employees contracted COVID-19 or became quarantined at the same time. This could lead to facility shutdowns and disruptions in the delivery of electricity and natural gas to our customers. In addition, remote working arrangements increase our data security risks, including loss of data related to sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information, through insider or outsider actions. Further, compliance with any future vaccine mandates associated with COVID-19 may result in labor shortages, including shortages in skilled professional and technical labor, supply chain disruptions, delays in contractors’ performance or completion of work, and/or increased costs for us, our contractors, or our suppliers.

Ameren cannot predict the extent or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic or its effects on the global, national, or local economy, the capital markets, or its customers, suppliers, business continuity plans, results of operations, financial position, liquidity, planned rate base growth, or sales volumes.

Customers’, investors’, legislators’, and regulators’ opinions of us are affected by many factors, including system reliability, implementation of our strategic plan, protection of customer information, rates, media coverage, and ESG practices, as well as actions by other utility companies. Negative opinions developed by customers, investors, legislators, or regulators could harm our reputation.

Our results are influenced by the expectations of our customers, investors, legislators, and regulators. Those expectations are based, in part, on the reliability and affordability of our utility services. Service interruptions and facility shutdowns can occur due to failures of equipment as a result of severe or destructive weather or other causes. The ability of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois to respond promptly to such failures can affect customer satisfaction. In addition to system reliability issues, the success of modernization efforts, our ability to safeguard sensitive customer information and protect our systems from cyber attacks, and other actions can affect customer satisfaction. The level of rates, the timing and magnitude of rate increases, and the volatility of rates can also affect customer satisfaction.

29
Our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan, including the transition of Ameren Missouri’s generation fleet and achievement of the carbon emission reduction targets outlined in the 2020 IRP, may affect customers’, investors’, legislators’, and regulators’ opinions and actions. Additionally, negative perceptions or publicity resulting from increasing scrutiny of ESG practices could negatively impact our reputation, investment in our common stock, or our access to capital markets. Customers’, investors’, legislators’, and regulators’ opinions of us can also be affected by media coverage, including social media, which may include information, whether factual or not, that damages our brand and reputation.

If customers, investors, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us and our utility services, this could result in increased costs associated with regulatory oversight and could affect the ROEs we are allowed to earn, as well as the access to, and the cost of, capital. Additionally, negative opinions about us or other utility companies could make it more difficult for our businesses to achieve favorable legislative or regulatory outcomes. Negative opinions could also result in sales volume reductions or increased use of distributed generation by our customers. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

We are subject to employee work force factors that could adversely affect our operations.

Our businesses depend upon our ability to employ and retain key officers and other skilled professional and technical employees. Certain specialized knowledge that focuses on skilled-craft and STEM-related disciplines is required to construct and operate generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Further, a significant portion of our work force is nearing retirement. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 26%, 27%, and 25% of Ameren’s, Ameren Missouri’s, and Ameren Illinois’ total employees were 55 years old or older, respectively. We are also party to collective bargaining agreements that collectively represent about 48%, 58%, and 55% of Ameren’s, Ameren Missouri’s and Ameren Illinois’ total employees, respectively. All of the Ameren Missouri collective bargaining unit contracts expire in 2022. The Ameren Illinois collective bargaining unit contracts expire in 2022 and 2023, which cover 92% and 8% of represented employees, respectively. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large portion of our non-field employees have been primarily working from home since March 2020. While our workforce has largely been stable, we experienced an increase in our attrition rate in 2021. Certain events, such as significant delays in finding appropriate replacement talent, inadequately trained replacement employees, a mismatch of skill sets to future needs, any work stoppage experienced in connection with negotiations of collective bargaining agreements, or challenges with transitioning working arrangements, could adversely affect our operations.

Our operations are subject to acts of terrorism, cyber attacks, and other intentionally disruptive acts.

Like other electric and natural gas utilities, our energy centers, fuel storage facilities, transmission and distribution facilities, and enterprise information systems may be affected by malicious acts, terrorist activities and other intentionally disruptive acts, including cyber attacks, which could disrupt our ability to produce or distribute our energy products. There have been attacks in the industry on energy infrastructure, such as substations and related assets, in the past, and there may be more attacks in the future as technology becomes more prevalent in energy infrastructure and the threat landscape continues to expand. Any such incident could limit our ability to generate, purchase, or transmit power or natural gas and could have significant regional economic consequences. Any such disruption could result in a significant decrease in revenues, a significant increase in costs including those for repair, or adversely affect economic activity in our service territory which, in turn, could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

There has been an increase in the number and sophistication of physical and cyber attacks across all industries worldwide. Cyber attacks could include viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware and other ransom-based attacks, improper access by third parties, attacks on email systems, and attacks leading to data loss, operational control, or exploitation of vulnerabilities specific to internally developed systems or to those provided and/or maintained by our suppliers, among various other security breaches. A security breach at our physical assets or in our information systems could affect the reliability of the transmission and distribution system, disrupt electric generation, including nuclear generation, and/or subject us to financial harm resulting from theft or the inappropriate release or destruction of certain types of information, including sensitive customer, employee, financial, and operating system information. Many of our suppliers, vendors, contractors, and information technology providers have access to systems that support our operations and maintain customer and employee data. A breach of these third-party systems could adversely affect our business as if it was a breach of our own system. If a significant breach occurred, our reputation could be adversely affected, customer confidence could be diminished, and/or we could be subject to increased costs associated with regulatory oversight, fines or legal claims, any of which could result in a significant decrease in revenues or significant costs for remedying the impacts of such a breach. Our generation, transmission, and distribution systems are part of an interconnected grid. Therefore, a disruption caused by a cyber incident at another utility, electric generator, RTO, or commodity supplier could also adversely affect our businesses. Insurance might not be adequate to cover losses that arise in connection with these events. In addition, new regulations could require changes in our security measures and result in increased costs. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.

30
Our businesses are dependent on our ability to access the capital markets successfully. We might not have access to sufficient capital in the amounts and at the times needed, as well as on reasonable terms.

We rely on the issuance of short-term and long-term debt and equity as significant sources of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flow, as well as to refinance existing long-term debt. The inability to raise debt or equity capital on reasonable terms, or at all, could negatively affect our ability to maintain or to expand our businesses. Events beyond our control, such as depressed economic conditions, the COVID-19 pandemic, or extreme volatility in the debt, equity, or credit markets, might create uncertainty that could increase our cost of capital or impair or eliminate our ability to access the debt, equity, or credit markets, including our ability to draw on bank credit facilities. Any adverse change in our credit ratings could reduce access to capital and trigger collateral postings and prepayments. Such changes could also increase the cost of borrowing and the costs of fuel, power, and natural gas supply, among other things, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
