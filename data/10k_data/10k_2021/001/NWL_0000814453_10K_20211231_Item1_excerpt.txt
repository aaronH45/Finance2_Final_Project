GENERAL

Newell Brands is a leading global consumer goods company with a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Rubbermaid, FoodSaver, Calphalon, Sistema, Sharpie, Paper Mate, Dymo, EXPO, Elmer’s, Yankee Candle, Graco, NUK, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, First Alert, Spontex, Coleman, Campingaz, Oster, Sunbeam and Mr. Coffee. Newell Brands' beloved brands enhance and brighten consumers lives at home and outside by creating moments of joy, building confidence and providing peace of mind. The Company sells its products in nearly 200 countries around the world and has operations on the ground in over 40 of these countries, excluding third-party distributors.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

The Company is continuing to execute on its turnaround strategy of building a global, next generation consumer products company that can unleash the full potential of its brands in a fast-moving omni-channel environment. The strategy, developed in 2019, is designed to:

•Drive sustainable top line growth by focusing on innovation, sharpening brand positioning, strengthening the international businesses, enhancing digital marketing and omni-channel capabilities, and building customer relationships; 

•Improve operating margins by driving productivity and overhead savings, while reinvesting in the business; 

•Accelerate cash conversion cycle by focusing on cash efficiency and improving key working capital metrics;

•Strengthen the portfolio by investing in attractive categories that are aligned with its capabilities and strategy and optimizing product mix; and

•Strengthen organizational capabilities and employee engagement by building a winning team and focusing the best people on the right things.

The Company is implementing this strategy while addressing key challenges such as shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; significant inflationary and supply chain pressures, and an evolving regulatory landscape. The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its impact to the Company’s business resulted in the acceleration of the turnaround initiatives in many respects.

Continued execution of these strategic imperatives, in combination with new initiatives aimed to build operational excellence, will better position the Company for long-term sustainable growth. One such initiative that was announced in the third quarter of 2021 is Project Ovid, a multi-year, customer centric supply chain initiative to transform the Company's go-to-market capabilities in the U.S., improve customer service levels and drive operational efficiencies. This initiative is expected to leverage technology to further simplify the organization by harmonizing and automating processes. Project Ovid is designed to optimize the Company’s distribution network by creating a single integrated supply chain from 23 business-unit-centric supply chains. The initiative is intended to reduce administrative complexity, improve inventory and invoicing workflow for our customers and enhance product availability for consumers through omni-channel enablement. This new operating model is also expected to drive efficiencies by better utilizing the Company's transportation and distribution network. 

Sale of Connected Home & Security Business

On February 6, 2022, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Connected Home & Security (“CH&S”) business unit to Resideo Technologies, Inc. for a purchase price of $593 million, subject to customary working capital and transaction adjustments.

The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.

Coronavirus (COVID-19)

The COVID-19 pandemic, which began in late 2019, has continued to disrupt the Company’s global operations, similar to those

of many large, multi-national corporations in three primary areas:

Supply chain. Of its 135 manufacturing and distribution facilities, approximately 20 were temporarily closed at the end of the first quarter of 2020, the most significant of which were its South Deerfield, Massachusetts, Home Fragrance plant, its Mexicali, Mexico and India Writing facilities, and its Juarez, Mexico Connected Home and Security facility, all of which were closed in accordance with applicable government guidelines. The majority of the Company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities reopened during the second and third quarter of 2020 and have since been operating at or near capacity with inventory levels replenished. The Company does, however, continue to face significant product, supply and labor shortages, capacity constraints and logistical challenges across its businesses, including port congestion, constrained shipping container availability and delays in carrier pickup, which have negatively impacted the Company's ability to satisfy demand for its products, creating order backlog in a number of categories. The Company also continues to face significantly higher than expected inflation for commodities, primarily resin, sourced finished goods, transportation and labor, which had a negative high-single-digit-percentage impact to costs of products sold for 2021. These various disruptions are expected to persist, at least in the near-term. To help mitigate the negative impact of inflation to the operating performance of its businesses, the Company has secured selective pricing increases, accelerated productivity initiatives and deployed overhead cost containment efforts.

Retail. While the Company’s largest retail customers experienced a surge in sales as their stores remained open, a number of secondary customers, primarily in the specialty and department store channels, temporarily closed their brick and mortar doors in March 2020, and began to reopen in certain regions where conditions improved towards the end of the second quarter of 2020. These dynamics, in combination with some retailers’ prioritization of essential items, have had a meaningful impact on the Company's traditional order patterns. In addition, the Company temporarily closed its Yankee Candle retail stores in North America as of mid-March of 2020 due to COVID-19. These stores reopened by the end of the third quarter of 2020 and have remained open since.

Consumer demand patterns. During the quarantine phase of the pandemic in 2020, consumer purchasing behavior strongly shifted to certain focused categories. Certain of the Company’s product categories benefited from this shift, primarily in Food, Commercial and Home Appliances. Some of the Company’s other businesses were negatively impacted but have seen positive momentum with an increase in demand post lockdowns, in particular Writing, Baby and Home Fragrance. While the seasonality of its businesses reverted to historical trends in 2021, uncertainty still remains over the volatility and direction of future consumer demand patterns.

The Company believes the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's future sales, operating results, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition will continue to be driven by numerous evolving factors that the Company cannot accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including severity and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new strains and variants of the coronavirus, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, especially in areas where conditions have recently worsened and work restrictions, operational or travel bans have been reinstituted, the rate at which vaccines are administered to the general public, the timing and amount of fiscal stimulus and relief programs packages that may become available to the general public in the future, and any changes in consumer demand patterns for the Company's products as the impact of the global pandemic lessens.

With the spread of new strains and variants of the coronavirus, the Company continues to monitor developments, including government requirements and recommendations at the national, state, and local level on whether to reinstate and/or extend certain initiatives previously implemented to help contain the spread of COVID-19 and currently plans to mandate vaccinations for its U.S. employees.

OTHER INFORMATION

Multi-Product Offering

The Company’s broad product offering in multiple categories permits it to more effectively meet the needs of its customers. With families of leading brand names and profitable and innovative new products, the Company can assist volume purchasers in selling a more profitable product mix. As a potential single source for an entire product line, the Company can use program merchandising to improve product presentation, optimize display space for both sales and income, and encourage impulse buying by retail consumers.

Raw Materials and Sourced Finished Goods

The Company has multiple foreign and domestic sources of supply for substantially all of its material requirements. The raw materials and various purchased components required for its products have generally been available in sufficient quantities, although the Company did experience capacity constraints around certain raw materials and finished goods in 2021 driven by global conditions, including continued demand volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which are expected to continue into 2022. The Company’s product offerings require the purchase of resin, corrugate, glass, plastic, expanded polystyrene, extinguisher powder, nylon, paper, plastic resin, sawdust, tin plate, wax and wood, natural rubber, electrical components, glass fiber, magnesium, adhesives, various paper-related packaging materials and metals, including steel, stainless steel, aluminum and copper. The Company’s resin purchases are principally comprised of polyethylene, polypropylene and copolyester.

The Company also relies on third-party manufacturers as a source for finished goods. Historically, the Company has experienced inflation in sourced product costs due to currency fluctuations and increased input and labor costs. During 2021, the Company experienced significant inflationary pressures for its sourced finished goods driven by global conditions, including demand volatility related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is expected to continue into 2022. For a limited number of product lines, a single

manufacturer or a limited number of manufacturers may supply substantially all the finished goods for a product line. In particular, certain businesses within the Company’s Learning and Development segment rely on third-party manufacturers for substantially all of their products. Specifically, the Baby business unit has a single source of supply for products that comprise a majority of its sales and which owns the intellectual property for many of those products.

Backlog

The dollar value of unshipped orders is not material.

Seasonal Variations

Sales of the Company’s products tend to be seasonal, with sales, operating income and operating cash flow in the first quarter generally lower than any other quarter during the year, driven principally by reduced volume and the mix of products sold in the first quarter. The seasonality of the Company’s sales volume combined with the accounting for fixed costs, such as depreciation, amortization, rent, personnel costs and interest expense, impacts the Company’s results on a quarterly basis. In addition, the Company tends to generate the majority of its operating cash flow in the third and fourth quarters of the year due to seasonal variations in operating results, the timing of annual performance-based compensation payments, customer program payments, working capital requirements and credit terms provided to customers. 

The Company's sales and operating results were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, negatively impacting the Company's performance during the first half of 2020, with improved performance thereafter. While the seasonality of its businesses reverted back to historical patterns in 2021, uncertainty still remains over the volatility of the direction of future consumer demand patterns.

Patents and Trademarks

The Company has many patents, trademarks, brand names and tradenames that are, in the aggregate, important to its business. The Company’s most significant brands include Aprica, Baby Jogger, Calphalon, Campingaz, Coleman, Contigo, Crockpot, Dymo, Elmer’s, EXPO, First Alert, FoodSaver, Graco, Mapa, Marmot, Mr. Coffee, NUK, Oster, Paper Mate, Parker, Quickie, Rubbermaid Commercial Products, Rubbermaid, Sistema, Spontex, Sunbeam, WoodWick, Sharpie and Yankee Candle.

Customers/Competition

The Company’s principal customers are large mass merchandisers, discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, direct-to-consumer channels, specialty retailers and wholesalers, commercial distributors and e-commerce retailers. The dominant share of the market represented by large mass merchandisers, together with consumer shopping patterns, contributes to a market environment in which dominant multi-category and e-commerce retailers have strong negotiating power with suppliers. This environment may limit the Company’s ability to recover cost increases through pricing.

Current trends among retailers include fostering high levels of competition among suppliers, reducing current inventory levels, demanding innovative new products and products tailored to each of their unique requirements and requiring suppliers to maintain or reduce product prices and deliver products with shorter lead times. Other trends, in the absence of a strong new product development effort or strong end-user brands, are for retailers to import generic products directly from foreign sources and to source and sell products under their own private label brands, which compete with the Company’s products. The combination of these market influences has created an intensely competitive environment in which the Company’s principal customers continuously evaluate which product suppliers to use, resulting in downward pricing pressures and the need for big, consumer-meaningful brands, the ongoing introduction and commercialization of innovative new products, continuing improvements in category management and customer service, and the maintenance of strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company competes with numerous manufacturers and distributors of consumer products, many of which are large and well-established. Our Yankee Candle retail stores compete primarily with specialty candle and personal care retailers and a variety of other retailers, including department stores, gift stores and national specialty retailers that sell candles.

The Company’s principal methods of meeting its competitive challenges are creating and maintaining leading brands and differentiated products that deliver superior value and performance; delivering superior customer service and consistent on-time delivery and producing and procuring products at a competitive cost. In addition, the Company has an experienced management team that focuses on building consumer loyalty and increased consumer demand through increased investment in consumer insights and using those insights to develop innovative products and product features that meet consumers’ needs. The Company's service and delivery levels in 2021 were negatively impacted by product, supply and labor shortages, capacity constraints and logistical challenges across its businesses, all of which the Company expects to continue in 2022.

5

The Company has also positioned itself to respond to the competitive challenges in the retail environment by developing strong relationships with large, high-volume purchasers. The Company markets its strong multi-product offering through virtually every category of high-volume retailers, including discount, drug/grocery and variety chains; warehouse clubs; department, hardware and specialty stores; home centers; office superstores; contract stationers; and e-commerce retailers. The Company’s largest customer, Walmart Inc. and subsidiaries (“Walmart”), accounted for approximately 15% of net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Amazon, the Company's second largest customer, accounted for approximately 13%, 12%, and 9% of net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s top-ten customers in alphabetical order in 2021 included: Amazon, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Costco, Kroger, Lowe’s, Office Depot, Staples, Target, The Home Depot and Walmart.

The Company's strong employee base, along with its commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of the Company’s success.

The Company's employees are responsible for upholding the Company's goal of creating a safer, sustainable, productive, and consumer-focused future. The Company's values of Truth, Transparency, Teamwork and Trust guide our own actions as well as our relationships with consumers, customers, suppliers and each other. They are grounded in a people-first philosophy enabling the Company to deliver results, drive long-term sustainability and promote a winning culture. The Company tracks and reports internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices.

The Company embraces diversity, inclusion and belonging, and strongly believes that a truly consumer-focused workforce should be as diverse as the consumers it serves and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds of all team members. To attract a global and diverse workforce, the Company strives to build a culture where employees can bring their whole selves to work. Employee resource groups (“ERGs”) are Company-sponsored groups of employees that support and promote certain mutual objectives of both the employees and the Company, including inclusion and diversity and the professional development of employees. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. At December 31, 2021, the Company had the following six ERGs:

•BEACON (Black and African ancestry); 

•RAY (Women);

•OPEN (LGBTQ);

•NAAPA (Asian-American); 

•HOLA (Hispanic and Latinx); and

•VETS (Veterans and Military Family Members).

In 2022, we will continue to expand and introduce additional ERGs across the globe. 

The Company is focused on recruitment of diverse candidates and on internal talent development of its diverse leaders so they can advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the Company. The Company has adopted a policy requiring diverse slates for recruitment at the Director level and above. Also, during 2021, the Company conducted a fully digital, enterprise-wide engagement survey, which was given to all employee groups including professional, clerical and factory hourly employees and was 

6

available in 33 languages, which focused on measuring engagement and inclusion. The results showed that the majority of the scores were equal to or above the global benchmarks. 

The Company continues to emphasize employee development and training, and strives to align and deliver its People Agenda with its business strategies to recruit, develop and retain the right talent, skills and capabilities to deliver on its commitments. To empower employees, the Company provides a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources needed to be successful. Our Grow@Newell eLearning platform, which is an online portal, supplements the Company's talent development strategies with access to instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. The Company has a robust talent and succession planning process and has established specialized programs to support the development of its talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering, and operations. On an annual basis, the Company conducts an Organization and Leadership Review process with its Chief Executive Officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for its most critical roles. 

The Company believes its management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute its strategy and advance its product and technology leadership. The Chief Executive Officer and Executive Committee have meaningful industry experience. They partner and work closely with an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the consumer products industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of key management and executive employees, see the Risk Factors section below.
