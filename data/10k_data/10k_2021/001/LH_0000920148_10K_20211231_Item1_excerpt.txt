Strategic Review of Company Structure and Capital Allocation Strategy

In March 2021, the Company announced the undertaking of a comprehensive review by its board of directors (the Board) and management team of Labcorp's structure and capital allocation strategy. The review reflected the Board's and management team's view that the Company's value was not appropriately reflected in its stock price. As a part of this review, the Board and management worked with outside advisors, held extensive discussions with third parties, and considered a wide range of options, including significant acquisitions, divestitures, spinning off businesses, as well as spinning and merging those businesses with strategic partners. Ultimately, the Board unanimously concluded that the Company's existing structure is in the best interest of all stakeholders at this time and represents compelling opportunities to grow and create significant shareholder value. In December 2021, the Company announced the Board's conclusion, as well as actions that the management team and the Board are taking to enhance shareholder returns. These actions include: 

•initiating a dividend in the second quarter of 2022, with a target dividend payout ratio of between 15 to 20% of adjusted earnings;

•authorizing a $2.50 billion share repurchase program. As part of this program, $1.0 billion is being repurchased under an accelerated share repurchase plan that is expected to be complete by the end of April 2022;

•implementing a new LaunchPad business process improvement initiative, targeting savings of $350.0 million over the next three years;

•providing a longer-term outlook in connection with the announcement of the Company's 2021 year-end results in addition to the Company's annual guidance;

•providing additional business insights through enhanced disclosures beginning with Labcorp's results for the first quarter of 2022; and

•continuing a commitment to profitable growth through investments in science, innovation, and new technologies.

Management and the Board are committed to continuing to evaluate all avenues for enhancing shareholder value.

The updated capital allocation plan enables the Company to continue investment in key growth areas, including oncology, Alzheimer's disease, autoimmune disorders, and women's health. This plan is expected to fuel growth through innovation by using Labcorp's unparalleled data and insights to bring scientific advancements—both Labcorp-developed and those of other scientists—to market at scale. It reflects the Board's confidence in the Company's strong balance sheet and cash flow generation profile, as well as the Board's commitment to deploying capital to enhance value for shareholders, patients, providers, and pharmaceutical customers worldwide.

Index

The Company is expanding its important role in the rapidly evolving healthcare market by strengthening its market-leading positions across its portfolio of capabilities, growing strategic opportunities that drive new business, and differentiating its unique offerings, capabilities, and financial performance. To do so, Labcorp is focusing these efforts across the following strategic priorities:

1.Leveraging the Company's Diagnostic and Drug Development Capabilities 

Together, Dx’s and DD’s core capabilities and scientific and technological expertise empower the Company to create compelling solutions for clients and patients. The Company’s collective strength allows it to help pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device partners design better clinical studies, execute those studies faster through enhanced patient recruitment, take greater advantage of virtual and hybrid study options, and satisfy post-market surveillance requirements. For example, insights gained through diagnostics support drug development operations by assisting in the identification of patterns in disease progression, as well as individuals who would benefit from enrollment in certain clinical trials. Further, the Company's connections with a broad and diverse range of patients and healthcare providers allow it to both expand clinical trial participation opportunities to typically underrepresented communities, and to make clinical trials a viable treatment option for patients whose current treatment options may be limited or inadequate. 

In addition, the Company can advance companion and complementary diagnostics and other precision medicine innovations that match patients with targeted treatments based on genomics and other individual characteristics due to the experience, resources and data harnessed by both Dx and DD. Through comprehensive integration of those capabilities, the Company has a unique opportunity to extend its position as a market leader in the development and commercialization of new therapies and tests by providing data, insights, and answers for doctors, drug developers, and the public. 

2. Embedding Data and Digitalization Throughout the Company's Business 

The healthcare and life sciences industries remain among the most significantly impacted by technological advancements. By maximizing the use of advances in artificial intelligence, data, digitalization, and analytics, the Company strives to improve operating efficiency and create new, differentiated products and services that the Company believes will help its customers and deliver better care to patients.

The Company is using artificial intelligence to better identify and predict trends such as the timing and location of demand shifts for certain tests. In doing so, the Company is supporting an efficient use of supplies, staffing, and the Company’s advanced logistics used to route testing to the most appropriate laboratories and quickly deliver results. Artificial intelligence capabilities and advanced logistics continue to play an important role in the Company’s response to periods of heightened demand for COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. 

The Company creates, and has access to, significant volumes of data. By applying advanced analytics, the Company can help its customers improve their processes and reach better outcomes. The Company’s repository of test results help study sponsors assess patients' eligibility for clinical trials more quickly and accurately, enroll those patients faster, shorten the time needed for regulatory submission, and accelerate the availability of new medicines. Data is also being used by the Company to advance science and the public's understanding of certain treatments and illnesses, including chronic kidney disease.

Digitalization continues to be an area of focus for the Company as it responds to the use of technology-enabled tools and services by healthcare providers, patients and pharmaceutical companies for absorbing, handling, and disseminating information. These services include decentralized clinical trials, which offer the potential to remove barriers that may have slowed or prevented studies from being conducted in the past. Decentralized clinical trials can also make trial participation an option for more people, including individuals from underrepresented populations. Digitalization enabled many of the Company's employees to transition to remote work in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and maintain their remote work environment in 2021 with no discernible loss of productivity. Digitalization is also helping to reduce physical, study-related paperwork, which generates positive emissions impacts. 

In the U.S., the Company continues to improve its patients' experience in patient service centers (PSCs) by creating a seamless digital journey from appointment scheduling to results delivery. With an average of 3 million patients served in a given week, the Company strives to enhance their experience using its digital channels. In addition, the Company enhanced its digital capabilities through the acquisition of Ovia Health, a leading digital platform trusted by millions of individuals for family planning, pregnancy, and parenting support. 

3. Intensify Customer Focus

Labcorp serves a broad range of customers, including managed care organizations (MCOs), pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and diagnostics companies, governmental agencies, physicians and other healthcare providers, hospitals and health systems, employers, patients and consumers, contract research organizations (CROs), and independent clinical laboratories. The Company prioritizes a consistent, coordinated focus across all aspects of its operations, placing the customer at the center of its services, with the objective of becoming the customer's primary partner for solutions to their needs. In an 

10

Index

effort to provide a leading customer experience, the Company seeks customer feedback, communicates best practices and lessons learned, and provides robust employee training with respect to the needs of its customers.

Labcorp routinely introduces new products and services that benefit its customers. For example, in 2021, the Company began deploying the Labcorp Diagnostic Assistant, which delivers comprehensive lab results and clinical insights directly to the point of care. In April 2021, the Company opened an automated clinical trial kit production line in Belgium, doubling the automated production capacity of its industry leading central laboratory services business. The Company announced the opening of a new, integrated bioanalytical laboratory in Singapore during the fourth quarter of 2021, expanding customer access in the Asia-Pacific region. The Company also continued improving the patient experience in its U.S. PSCs, focusing its efforts to create a seamless digital journey from appointment scheduling to easier access to results. The Company will continue to explore and implement further actions to improve the experience for its customers.

4. Fortify the Company's Position as an Oncology Leader 

The field of oncology receives significant investment in research, development, and treatment. However, it remains an area of great unmet medical need. The Company believes the diagnosis and treatment of cancer will be the fastest-growing therapeutic area in the near future.

With the increased adoption of precision medicine, health and cancer care providers are relying on advanced testing to identify patients who will benefit from new, targeted treatments and therapies that are more effective and often have fewer side effects than chemotherapy and other traditional treatments. To harness the breadth of the Company's unique capabilities and further address this need, the Company formed an oncology business unit and launched an enterprise oncology platform in 2021. By focusing its diagnostic and drug development services on the fight against cancer, the Company is delivering targeted solutions that power better decisions and improved patient outcomes.

The Company is expanding its leadership in oncology through the introduction of new tests, strategic partnerships, acquisitions, and customer wins in clinical trials. In 2021, the Company launched OmniSeq INSIGHT, a comprehensive genomic and immune profiling, tissue-based test that integrates next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The Company capitalized on a previous investment in OmniSeq, announcing in July 2021 that it exercised its option to acquire the remaining ownership interest. In addition, the Company enhanced its precision diagnostic portfolio and its ability to increase access to oncology care globally by agreeing in late 2021 to acquire Personal Genome Diagnostics (PGDx), a provider of comprehensive liquid biopsy and tissue-based genomic products and services. PGDx offers the only diagnostic kit cleared by the FDA for pan-solid cancer comprehensive tumor profiling using a 500+ gene panel. The acquisition of PGDx closed in February 2022. The Company’s work in oncology has created meaningful business relationships across the healthcare ecosystem that it plans to enhance and grow. 

5. Pursue Opportunities with Short- and Long-Term and High-Growth Potential 

The Company has a long history of disciplined use of capital to invest in the growth of the business. The Company has made significant investments in the deployment of new technologies through both licensing and internal research and development, as well as strategic and tuck-in acquisitions in oncology, women's health, autoimmune disorders, diagnostic testing, and other important areas. Labcorp has also invested in establishing collaborative partnerships with other leading companies and organizations that share the Company’s goals and expectations. 

The Company continually evaluates its business and the broader healthcare and life sciences markets to proactively identify and assess:

•potential growth opportunities; 

•business areas that might not support continued growth and should be revamped or divested; 

•acquisition targets that meet its criteria for quality, value, and return on investment; 

•new products that would successfully integrate with or extend the Company’s offerings; and

•a balanced formula for capital allocation. 

Through a continued focus on these priorities, reinforced through the Company's review of its structure and capital allocation strategy that concluded in December 2021, Labcorp expects to be in an optimal position to make disciplined choices that maximize shareholder value, better protect the Company from market fluctuations and outside impacts, and fuel significant and profitable short- and long-term revenue growth. 

COVID-19 Pandemic Response

The Company has been intensely focused on supporting the fight against COVID-19 since the earliest stages of the pandemic, and it continues to play a substantial role in ongoing response efforts. 

11

Index

Diagnostic Testing and Clinical Trial Leadership

In 2021, the Company further expanded access to testing for COVID-19 and aided pharmaceutical companies in the development of critical COVID-19 vaccines and therapies by harnessing its diagnostic and drug development capabilities.

The Company received FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for multiple innovations during the year, including the use of its Pixel by Labcorp® COVID-19 test home collection kit for children ages 2-17. The Company was granted FDA EUA for a combined home collection kit enabling individuals as young as 2 years of age to simultaneously be tested for COVID-19 and influenza A/B. It also received FDA EUA for observed self-collection of COVID-19 PCR tests in its PSCs, providing flexibility and convenience for individuals who want the certainty of a PCR test or need PCR test results for work, travel, or other purposes. These achievements built on the Company's first COVID-19-related FDA EUA, which was received on March 16, 2020, for COVID-19 PCR testing. Labcorp was the first commercial laboratory in the U.S. to launch and receive an EUA for such testing. The Company also received FDA EUA in April 2020 for the Pixel by Labcorp® COVID-19 test home collection kit, and in December 2020 for over-the-counter purchase of these home collection kits. 

Labcorp's additional contributions to the pandemic response in 2021 included: 

•assisting in the identification and monitoring of COVID-19 variants and spikes in confirmed cases; 

•facilitating mass vaccination programs and expanding access to at-home test collections for underserved populations through partnerships at the state and local level;

•partnering with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to raise awareness of monoclonal antibody therapies;

•facilitating access to at-home COVID-19 test collection kits in retail stores such as Walgreens, and through on-demand delivery services; and 

•introducing new test options and building on the Company's portfolio of antibody testing. 

The Company maintained its ability to quickly scale-up COVID-19 PCR testing capacity throughout the year, even during periods of reduced demand. In doing so, the Company was able to immediately and effectively respond to surges in positive cases and testing needs. The Company performed approximately 30 million COVID-19 PCR tests and 4 million antibody tests in 2021, and since the start of the pandemic has performed approximately 61.5 million COVID-19 PCR tests and 8 million antibody tests. 

In addition, the Company's expertise and understanding of COVID-19, developed through its diagnostic offerings, has allowed it to become a leader in supporting clinical trials of COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. By the end of 2021, the Company won approximately 700 COVID-19 trial and study opportunities, ranging from small, nonclinical programs to late-stage clinical trials.

Base Business 

The Company's non-COVID-19 testing business (Base Business) continued its recovery in 2021. Base Business was negatively impacted in the first and second quarters of 2020, began to recover in the third quarter of 2020 and experienced a flattening in Base Business recovery in the fourth quarter of 2020. Patients continued their return to pre-pandemic healthcare routines in 2021, and the Company's pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers resumed their important research and development work. Throughout 2021, the Company's Base Business recovery helped to more than offset a decrease in PCR and antibody COVID-19 testing (COVID-19 Testing).

COVID-19 Outlook

COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, an extensive impact on the global health and economic environments. The Company continues to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, given continued unpredictability, corresponding state, local and federal government restrictions and policies, the continued emergence of new variants that may cause increases in cases that may impact the Company, and the potential for shifts in customer behavior.

While the Company anticipates that COVID-19 will continue to impact its business in 2022 and potentially beyond, the Company expects that increases in vaccination rates and booster shots, the development of new therapeutics and greater availability of rapid COVID-19 tests should result in a continued, significant decline in demand for COVID-19 Testing, with the potential for increases in demand at different times and across different geographies. As a result, COVID-19 Testing demand is not predicted to match 2021 levels. 

Capital Allocation

The Company believes it has a strong track record of deploying capital to investments that enhance the Company's business and return capital to shareholders. 

12

Index

During 2021, the Company invested $496.9 million in strategic business acquisitions. The acquisitions have expanded the Company’s service offerings, expanded its customer and revenue mix, and strengthened and broadened the scope of its geographic presence. The Company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities that leverage the Company’s core competencies, complement existing scientific and technological capabilities, increase the Company’s presence in key geographic, therapeutic and strategic areas, and meet or exceed the Company’s financial criteria. 

During 2021, the Company repurchased 5.2 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $282.05 for a total cost of $1,668.5 million, which included $1,000.0 million paid in respect of an Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) program for which the Company received 80% of the shares calculated at the price at the inception of the ASR Agreements. At the end of 2021, the Company had outstanding authorization from the Board to purchase $1,631.5 of Company common stock. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.

During 2021, capital expenditures were $460.4 million. The Company also repaid $1,000.0 million of its Senior Notes along with $375.0 million of the outstanding 2019 Term Loan, and also issued $1,000.0 million of new Senior Notes. The Company expects capital expenditures in 2022 to be approximately 4.0% of revenues, primarily in connection with projects to support growth in the Company's core businesses, facility expansion and updates, projects related to its new LaunchPad initiative, and further acquisition integration initiatives. 

The Company will continue to evaluate all opportunities for strategic deployment of capital in light of market conditions.

Seasonality and External Factors

The Company experiences seasonality across its business. For example, testing volume generally declines during the year-end holiday period and other major holidays and can also decline due to inclement weather or natural disasters. Declines in testing volume reduce revenues, operating margins and cash flows. Operations are also impacted by changes in the global economy, exchange rate fluctuations, political and regulatory changes, the progress of ongoing studies and the startup of new studies, as well as the level of expenditures made by the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries in R&D. As discussed in more detail elsewhere in Item 1, COVID-19 impacted the Company in 2021. This impact included the effect of the Company’s response to the virus through its testing and drug development services, as well as the effect of COVID-19 on the global economy and demand for the Company’s non-COVID-19 services.

In 2021, approximately 15.3% of the Company's revenues were billed in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with the Swiss franc, British pound, Canadian dollar, and the euro representing the largest components of its currency exposure. Given the seasonality and changing economic factors impacting the business, comparison of the results for successive quarters may not accurately reflect trends or results for the full year.

The Company's Business

The Company experienced growth across all key financial metrics in 2021. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 The Company reports its business in two segments, Dx and DD. In 2021, Dx and DD contributed 64% and 36%, respectively, of revenues to the Company, and in 2020 contributed 65% and 35%, respectively. Nearly all of Dx’s revenues are generated in the U.S., with a smaller portion in Canada and a relatively small amount in the rest of the world. DD’s revenues are nearly evenly split between the U.S. and the rest of the world, with approximately 48% derived from the U.S. and approximately 52% from other countries. Although this allocation of revenues provides some protection from economic shifts in any one country, it is still heavily tilted towards the U.S. As a result, the Company continues to actively explore new and expanded business opportunities outside the U.S. to further diversify its sources of revenues. The Company's revenues by segment payers/customer groups and by geography for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Dx Segment 

During 2021, the Dx segment generated $10,363.6 million in total revenues and $2,988.5 million in operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 28.8%. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Dx is an independent clinical laboratory business. It offers a comprehensive menu of frequently requested core testing and specialty testing through an integrated network of primary and specialty laboratories across the U.S. This network is supported by a sophisticated information technology system, with more than 80,000 electronic interfaces to deliver test results, nimble and efficient logistics, and local labs offering rapid response testing. 

Dx also provides patient access points that are strategically and conveniently located throughout the U.S., including nearly 2,000 PSCs and more than 6,000 in-office phlebotomists located in customer offices and facilities. Although testing for healthcare purposes and customers who provide healthcare services represents the most significant portion of the clinical laboratory industry, clinical laboratories also perform testing for other purposes and customers, including employment and occupational testing, DNA testing to determine parentage and to assist in immigration eligibility determinations, environmental

testing, wellness testing, toxicology testing, pain management testing, and medical drug monitoring. Dx offers an expansive test menu that includes a wide range of clinical, anatomic pathology, genetic and genomic tests, and regularly adds new tests and improves the methodology of existing tests to enhance patient care. Dx also offers consumer-initiated wellness testing available online through its Labcorp OnDemand™ platform. The Pixel by Labcorp® COVID-19 PCR and combined COVID-19 + flu at-home collection kits are also available through Labcorp OnDemand. Dx typically processes tests for more than 3 million patient encounters each week. 

As part of an ongoing commitment to be an efficient and high-value provider of laboratory services, beginning in 2015, Dx implemented a comprehensive business process improvement initiative known as LaunchPad. The initiative was designed to reengineer the Company's systems and processes to create a sustainable and more efficient business model, and to improve the experience of all stakeholders. Dx achieved its goals for the initial phase of LaunchPad of delivering both short- and long-term savings, and of implementing system and process improvements that are expected to continue generating benefits for the foreseeable future. Dx subsequently extended LaunchPad, adding new enterprise-wide projects and establishing the initiative as an ongoing continuous improvement program. Dx’s LaunchPad initiative delivered approximately $200 million in net savings for the period of late 2018 through the end of 2021. As mentioned above in Part I of this Annual Report, the Company is implementing a new, enterprise-wide LaunchPad initiative, targeting savings of $350 million beginning in 2022 and ending in 2024.

The Dx business can be categorized into the following components:

Effect of U.S. Market Changes on the Clinical Laboratory Business

The delivery of, and reimbursement for, healthcare continues to change in the U.S., impacting all stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory business. Medicare (which principally serves patients who are 65 and older), Medicaid (which principally serves low-income patients) and insurers have increased their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. Measures to regulate healthcare delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have resulted in reduced prices, added costs and decreased test utilization for the clinical laboratory industry by imposing new, increasingly complex regulatory and administrative requirements. The government also has continued to adjust the Medicare and Medicaid fee schedules at the national and local level, and the Company believes that pressure to reduce government reimbursement will continue. 

Fees for most laboratory services reimbursed by Medicare are established in the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) and fees for other testing reimbursed by Medicare, primarily related to pathology, are covered by the Physician Fee Schedule (PFS). During 2021, approximately 8.5% of Dx’s revenue was reimbursed under the CLFS (8.8% in 2020), and approximately 0.4% was reimbursed under the PFS (0.4% in 2020). Over the past several years, Dx has experienced governmental reimbursement reductions as a direct result of several Congressional acts and regulatory initiatives. These laws include provisions designed to control healthcare expenses reimbursed by government programs through a combination of reductions to fee schedules, incentives to physicians to participate in alternative payment models such as risk-sharing, and new methods to establish and adjust fees.

The most significant of these developments was the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), which became law on April 1, 2014, and which went into effect on January 1, 2018. Beginning in 2018, under PAMA, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) set the CLFS using the weighted median of reported private payer prices paid to certain laboratories that receive a majority of their Medicare revenue from the CLFS and PFS and that bill Medicare under their own National Provider Identifier (NPI). Applicable labs, including Dx, were required to begin reporting their test-specific private payer payment amounts to CMS during the first quarter of 2017. CMS used that private market data to calculate weighted median prices for each test (based on applicable current procedural technology (CPT) codes) to represent the new CLFS rates beginning in 2018, subject to certain phase-in limits. For 2018-2020, a test price could not be reduced by more than 10.0% per year. PAMA resulted in a net reduction in reimbursement revenue of approximately $245.0 million between 2018-2020 from all payers affected by the CLFS.

Due to enactment of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) passed by Congress on March 27, 2020, the Medicare reimbursement cuts that would have occurred under PAMA in 2021 were delayed by one year. In 2021, Dx realized an increase of approximately $0.3 million in PFS revenue as a result of the provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations and Coronavirus Relief Package. In 2021, Dx realized an additional increase of approximately $5.8 million in aggregate Medicare reimbursement associated with the suspension of sequestration through December of 2021, as a result of provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations and Coronavirus Relief Package that were extended as a result of an Act to Prevent Across-the-Board Direct Spending Cuts.

On December 10, 2021, President Biden signed into law S. 610, the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act, which delayed by one additional year the data reporting requirements and Medicare reimbursement cuts that would have occurred under PAMA in 2022. In 2022, Dx anticipates that it will realize a decrease of approximately $0.4 million in PFS revenue, driven by reductions in reimbursement for flow cytometry procedures and a decrease of approximately $10.0 million in aggregate Medicare reimbursement associated with the phased in reinstitution of sequestration as a result of provisions included in the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act.

The Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act also included mitigations to several other non-PAMA Medicare cuts in addition to delaying Medicare reimbursement cuts under PAMA. It delayed the 4% Medicare cuts that would otherwise have occurred in 2022 under statutory “pay-as-you-go,” or PAYGO, rules to offset the cost of the American Rescue Plan Act by one year. In addition, it delayed the resumption of the 2% Medicare sequestration until April 1, 2022, and reduces to 0.75% the previous 3.75% reduction to PFS reimbursement that was scheduled for 2022. To offset the cost, the Medicare sequestration is increased to 2.25% for January-June of 2030, and to 3.0% for July-December 2030.

Pursuant to PAMA, for 2023-2025, a test price cannot be reduced by more than 15.0% per year. CLFS rates for 2026 and subsequent periods will not be subject to phase-in limits. The phase-in of rates for Clinical Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (CDLTs) established in 2018 will continue in 2023. New CLFS rates will be established in 2024 based on data from 2019 to be reported in 2023. New CLFS rates will be established in 2027 based on data from 2025 to be reported in 2026. CLFS rates for Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests will be updated annually.

The American Clinical Laboratory Association (ACLA) has filed a federal civil action challenging the legal basis for the data collection methodology CMS used to derive the data from which the median prices were calculated. Since the initial data 

16

Index

collection, CMS has revised its PAMA regulations to increase the number of hospital outreach labs that will be required to report private market data in future collections. Reports by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) on PAMA implementation have identified certain instances of actual or potential increased Medicare expenditures under PAMA, as well as potential alternative methodologies for data collection under PAMA, which could result in further efforts to amend PAMA by Congress. 

ACLA continues to work with Congress on potential legislative reform of PAMA, which if adopted could reduce the negative impact of PAMA as currently implemented by CMS. Under the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries (LAB) Act, MedPAC was required to conduct a study and make recommendations to Congress on ways to improve data collection, reporting, and rate setting under PAMA to achieve, in a less burdensome manner, CLFS rates that accurately and fairly reflect private market rates. MedPAC's June 2021 report to Congress included an analysis of potential statistical sampling methodologies that could accomplish that objective, and ACLA has incorporated the concept in PAMA reform proposals to Congress. The Company supports the ongoing efforts to prevent or lessen the negative impact of the changes to the CLFS pursuant to PAMA, and the full impact of those efforts, and what the long-term effect will be on the CLFS rates is not yet known.

Further healthcare reform could occur in 2022, including changes to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Medicare reform, as well as administrative requirements that may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services in ways that are currently unpredictable. 

In addition, market-based changes have affected and will continue to affect the clinical laboratory business. Reimbursement from commercial payers for diagnostic testing may shift away from traditional, fee-for-service models to alternatives, including value-based, bundled pay-for-performance, and other risk-sharing payment models. The growth of the managed care sector and consolidation of MCOs present various challenges and opportunities to Dx and other clinical laboratories. Dx's ability to attract and retain MCO customers has become even more important as the impact of various healthcare reform initiatives continues, including expanded health insurance exchanges and ACOs. 

The Company serves many MCOs. These organizations have different contracting philosophies, which are influenced by the design of their products. Some MCOs contract with a limited number of clinical laboratories and engage in direct negotiation of rates. Other MCOs adopt broader networks with generally uniform fee structures for participating clinical laboratories. In some cases, those fee structures are specific to independent clinical laboratories, while the fees paid to hospital-based and physician-office laboratories may be different, and are typically higher. MCOs may also offer Managed Medicare or Managed Medicaid plans. In addition, some MCOs use capitation rates to fix the cost of laboratory testing services for their enrollees. Under a capitated reimbursement arrangement, the clinical laboratory receives a per-member, per-month payment for an agreed upon menu of laboratory tests, or based upon the proportionate share earned by Dx from a capitation pool. When the agreed upon reimbursement is based solely on an established rate per member, revenue is not impacted by the volume of testing performed. Under a capitation pool arrangement, the aggregate value of an established rate per member is distributed based on the volume and complexity of the procedures performed by laboratories participating in the agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, capitated contracts with MCOs accounted for approximately $332.3 million, or 3.2%, of Dx's revenues. 

In addition to reductions in test reimbursement, the Company also anticipates potential declines in test volumes as a result of increased controls over the utilization of laboratory services by Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payers, particularly MCOs. MCOs are implementing, directly or through third parties, various types of laboratory benefit management programs, which may include lab networks, utilization management tools (such as prior authorization and/or prior notification), and claims edits, which impact coverage and reimbursement of clinical laboratory tests. Some of these programs address clinical laboratory testing broadly, while others are focused on certain types of testing, including molecular, genetic and toxicology testing. In addition, continued movement by patients into consumer-driven health plans may have an impact on the utilization of laboratory testing. Test volumes in 2022 could also decline compared to 2021 and 2020 if demand for SARS-CoV-2 testing declines.

Despite the overall negative market changes regarding reimbursement discussed above, the Company believes that the volume of clinical laboratory testing is positively influenced by several factors, including the expansion of Medicaid, managed care, and private insurance exchanges. In addition, the Company believes that increased knowledge of the human genome and continued innovation in laboratory medicine will continue to foster greater appreciation of the value of gene-based diagnostic assays. Additional factors that may lead to future volume growth include an increase in the number and types of tests that are readily available (due to advances in technology and increased cost efficiencies) for the diagnosis of disease, and the general aging of the U.S. population. Periodic infectious disease outbreaks such as the SARS-CoV-2 virus also have the potential to generate additional testing volume in the future. The Company also believes that it and other large, independent clinical laboratory testing companies will be able to increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to a number of market factors, primarily related to a continued drive to improve outcomes and reduce costs across the healthcare system, including but not limited to greater price transparency required under new “surprise billing” laws and regulations requiring

disclosure of hospital charges. Dx believes that its enhanced and growing esoteric menu of tests, leading position with companion diagnostics, broad geographic footprint, and operating efficiency provide a strong platform for growth.

DD Segment

During 2021, the DD segment generated $5,845.5 million in total revenue and $547.7 million in operating income, resulting in an operating margin of 9.4%.

Rebranding

In December 2020, the Company announced the evolution of its brand to signify the pivotal role the Company's capabilities play in society as a source of health answers. It underscores the Company's commitment to science and data, moving with urgency, empowering better health outcomes, and breakthrough and transformative approaches to patient care using the Company's diverse and global expertise. As part of the rebranding, the Company introduced a new company logo and associated its business unit brands with the Labcorp name. The Company’s drug development segment, formerly referred to as Covance Drug Development, became Labcorp Drug Development in June 2021. The Company's diagnostics segment, formerly referred to as LabCorp Diagnostics, transitioned to Labcorp Diagnostics and a new logo in 2021. 

Human Capital 

Mission and Culture

Labcorp believes in the power of science to change lives. The Company’s culture centers around its mission to improve health and improve lives. The Company's more than 75,500 employees serve clients in over 100 countries. They are essential to the Company’s ability to innovate and advance science and technology to empower patients, providers, and pharmaceutical companies to make clear and confident decisions. Labcorp’s employees are also critical to its ongoing support of the COVID-19 pandemic response through diagnostic testing and its work to aid pharmaceutical companies in the development of vaccines and treatments. Engaging the collective expertise and passion of its employees is vital to achieving the Company’s mission, which permeates its performance-driven, collaborative, inclusive, customer-centered, and inquisitive culture.

Workforce Demographics

The Company’s success depends on its sustained ability to attract, develop, and retain a highly specialized and skilled global workforce. Management believes that the Company has good working relationships with its employees. Employees are globally dispersed, with 75% in the U.S. and Canada, 12% in Asia, 13% in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and less than 1% in Latin America. Of the Company’s global workforce, 90% of employees are full time, and 10% are part time. Four percent of Labcorp’s global workforce is employed under a collective bargaining agreement. Depending on business demand and the talent-hiring environment, Labcorp supplements up to 12% of its workforce with contingent workers.

The challenges of 2021, felt globally, also presented the Company with significant challenges in acquiring and retaining talent. Despite these obstacles, Labcorp’s global workforce increased by more than 4%. The majority of Labcorp's hires are sourced through an internal talent acquisition team. In addition, the Company continues to grow its workforce through mergers and acquisitions. The Company implemented significant investments to retain talent and enable the organization to meet the business needs for growth, which are discussed further in the section below on “Compensation and Benefits.”

Throughout the pandemic, a significant portion of Labcorp’s employees have been working diligently to serve patients and customers. To ensure the safety and welfare of our employees, the majority of employees who do not work with patients, animals, in labs, or in logistics, continue to work remotely. This includes call center employees, customer service teams, sales teams, and corporate and functional teams. Going forward, the Company expects that a significant number of employees will continue working remotely, or through hybrid, in-office and remote work arrangements. The Company believes that flexibility in work location and arrangements expands the pool from which it can source experienced and valuable talent.

In early 2022, the Company initiated a Voice of the Employee Survey.

Compensation

As the Company’s business becomes increasingly complex, global, and dynamic, the Company believes that its compensation and benefits programs must be competitive and flexible to attract and retain the caliber of talent needed to continue to move the business forward. In 2021, the Company faced unique challenges to growing and maintaining its global workforce. The Company believes that its ability to expand the workforce in 2021 evidences that the Company's compensation and benefit strategies are market competitive and support the business needs to attract and retain talent.

The Company continually monitors market activity and employee movement within and outside of the core life sciences industry to maintain competitiveness, given the dynamic business environment and labor market challenges it faces.

Labcorp’s employees met the unique challenges faced by patients and clients as the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021. The Company invested more than $120 million to recognize and reward our global workforce, with particular focus placed on frontline workers. These investments included: 

•$51 million in market-based pay adjustments, including an increase in the minimum wage for all non-union employees in the U.S. to $15 per hour;

•$21 million to increase base wages up to an additional 1.5% to encourage participation in the 401(k) retirement savings plan for 37,000 U.S. employees earning less than $75,000 per year;

•$35 million in two separate, global “gratitude” bonuses for more than 61,500 employees; and

•$14 million in retention payments to employees in key global positions to encourage continued career development with the Company.

Employee Wellness

The Company also continued investing in the health and wellness of its global workforce, with particular emphasis on improving its U.S. health benefits program for employees. The Company’s efforts on this front included:

•no annual cost increase for the payroll contributions in its U.S. Healthy Value medical, dental and vision insurance plans, impacting approximately 36,000 covered employees and more than 30,000 dependents. For approximately 26,000 employees in the U.S. earning less than $50,000 per year, the Company further reduced the cost of monthly medical insurance contributions by $240 per year; 

•adding company-paid disability insurance coverage for short- and long-term disability for all U.S. employees;

•providing up to $4,560 in annual medical plan contribution discounts for over 36,000 employees and their spouses for committing to and maintaining a healthy and tobacco-free lifestyle; 

•encouraging health and wellness education and activities by providing up to $1,000 in Health Reimbursement Account contributions to approximately 31,000 employees and their spouses or partners. This included $100 for COVID-19 vaccines and $50 for Flu vaccines;

•reimbursing up to $300 in fitness-related costs for approximately 16,000 employees.

The Company continually educates its workforce on health issues of importance. For example, the Company provided a series of videos throughout 2021 from its medical experts covering the facts, safety, and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccines. Further, the Company has also prioritized continuous education on the importance of mental well-being, through communications and resources made available to all employees. The Company believes that its investments in compensation and wellness are crucial to maintaining competitive positioning and a productive and engaged workforce.

Development and Training

To meet the needs of patients and clients in the evolving and competitive diagnostics and drug development markets, the Company is committed to creating a work environment that supports a focus on the continuous development and training of its 

21

Index

employees. With this focus, the Company believes it is well-positioned in the long term to meet the demands of the regulatory environment and accelerate its ability to innovate and develop talent in a highly skilled and competitive talent market.

Labcorp's curriculum has three primary focus areas: regulatory training, technical training, and professional development. Regulatory training is required by laws and regulations for the Company to operate in certain areas within the life sciences industry and in certain jurisdictions. Technical training and professional development enable the Company to compete more effectively in the life sciences industry.

The Company maintains an extensive library of over 46,000 courses that are available virtually within its global learning management system. In 2021, Labcorp employees completed over 3.2 million hours of training, primarily consisting of regulatory and technical training. In addition, due to the Company’s access to sensitive and personally identifiable information, employees completed over 1.3 million IT security training courses, representing more than 300,000 total hours, with the goal of maintaining IT system safety and security for clients and patients.

Labcorp also invests in the professional development of its talent, and in retaining our best employees for future internal opportunities. In 2021, employees completed more than 65,000 hours of professional development.

Challenges in the talent labor market have reinforced the need to offer new and engaging learning resources. In 2021, the Company expanded its approach to tuition assistance, helping an additional 500 employees complete college degrees in the life science and healthcare fields. In addition, Labcorp added new relationships with leading learning partners that provide open, online courses. These partners provide video courses, job aides, and short, self-paced learning taught by industry experts.

Health and Safety

The nature of the Company's business requires employees to work directly with patients and animals. This includes the handling, processing, and testing of human or animal specimens on a daily basis. As the health and safety of employees is a primary concern, the Company has established numerous employee health and safety protocols, including engineering and administrative controls, policies, procedures, processes, and training to minimize the potential for, and the severity of, work-related injuries and illnesses.

In 2021, the Company reorganized its Environment, Health and Safety (EHS) function, combining Dx and DD programs to enable consistency and common policies, procedures, and areas of focus. The Company was able to maintain its work-related injury rate per 100 employees at a low 1.6, and to reduce its work-related lost work injury rate per 100 employees by 40%, from 0.5 to 0.3. The Company also implemented a common Corporate EHS Audit process, allowing it to assess locations against common expectations and performance criteria. In response to COVID-19, the Company modified the audit format so that it could be effectively performed virtually.

While COVID-19 presented continued challenges, the Company minimized the impact on staff and operations through careful planning and consistent global implementation of precautionary measures. These measures included additional cleaning and sanitization, social distancing, the use of protective equipment such as facemasks, face shields and respirators, the increased utilization of work from home, and leveraging video and communications technology.

Employee Giving

The Labcorp Charitable Foundation, a private, charitable 501(c)(3) organization established by the Company, invested in more than 70 programs in 2021 that align with the Company’s strategic mission to improve health and improve lives. The Foundation’s funding supports the focus areas of health, education, and community across the globe.

In addition, the Company's employees took advantage of many opportunities to support charitable causes and make a positive impact in their communities. 

Annually, U.S. colleagues have the opportunity to automatically direct a portion of each paycheck to one or more of six selected charities through the Employee Giving Campaign: the American Cancer Society, American Heart Association, American Diabetes Association, American Red Cross (Disaster Relief), United Way, and the National Urban League. Employee contributions support these charities to provide needed services in their local communities and across the nation. 

The Company's global colleagues also support the local communities where they live and work. For example, as India endured a second, severe wave of positive COVID-19 cases, Labcorp’s India Crisis Management Team helped 2,398 employees and their families get vaccinated. Additionally, in celebration of Earth Day, Labcorp colleagues in China took an active part in the American Chamber of Commerce Shanghai Annual E-waste Drive, in which employees donated personal electronics that they no longer use. The donated equipment was distributed to schools throughout rural communities in China to improve access to technology.

The Company provides its services to a broad range of customers across Dx and DD. The primary customer groups serviced by the Company include:

•Health Plans. The Company serves many health plans, including MCOs and other health insurance providers, each of which operate on a national, regional, or local basis. In certain locations, health plans may delegate to independent physician associations (IPAs) or other alternative delivery systems (e.g., ACOs) the ability to negotiate for services on behalf of certain members. 

•Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, Medical Device, and Diagnostics Companies. The Company provides development services to hundreds of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device, and diagnostics companies, ranging from the world's largest multi-nationals to emerging, small and mid-market companies. 

•Physicians and Other Healthcare Providers. Physicians who require clinical laboratory testing for their patients are a primary source of requests for Dx's testing services. 

•Hospitals and Health Systems. The Company provides hospitals and health systems with services ranging from core and specialty testing to supply chain and technical support services, and the opportunity to be a research partner for participation in studies and clinical trials with DD. In some cases, a hospital’s on-site laboratory may be operated or managed by an outside contractor or independent laboratory, including the Company. 

•Other Customers. The Company serves a broad range of other customers, including, but not limited to, governmental agencies, employers, patients and consumers, CROs, crop protection and chemical companies, academic institutions, independent clinical laboratories, and retailers. 

Sales, Marketing, and Customer Service

The Company offers its services through a sales force focused on serving the specific needs of customers in different market segments. The Company's sales force is responsible for both new sales and for customer retention and relationship building.

For Dx, these market segments generally include primary care, women's health, specialty medicine (e.g., infectious diseases, endocrinology, gastroenterology, and rheumatology), oncology, ACOs, and hospitals and health systems, with different representatives focused on each segment to better understand and respond to the unique needs of each clinical area. The DD global sales organization provides customer coverage across the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical device industries for services including lead optimization, preclinical safety assessment, analytical services, clinical trials, central laboratories, biomarkers, and companion diagnostics, market access and technology solutions. As part of the Company's ongoing strategic priority to maximize the value of its unique leadership in both diagnostics and drug development, sales representatives from each business segment work together on outreach to potential customers of each business, including hospitals and health systems that may purchase testing and participate in clinical trials, or pharmaceutical, biotechnology or medical device companies whose studies may benefit from use of Dx’s specialty testing or network of PSCs.

In mid-2021, Labcorp launched its “In Pursuit of Answers” campaign to emphasize the Company's commitment to its customers and the dedication of its employees. This campaign also highlights the Company's impact on public health, its new, unified brand, and its critical role in the fight against COVID-19.

Market Opportunity

Dx

The Company believes that in 2021, the U.S. clinical laboratory testing industry generated revenues of more than $80 billion. The clinical laboratory industry consists primarily of three types of providers: hospital-based laboratories, physician-office laboratories, and independent clinical and anatomical pathology laboratories, such as those operated by Dx.

The clinical laboratory business is intensely competitive. CMS has estimated that, as of January 2022, there were 9,254 hospital-based laboratories, 131,238 physician-office laboratories, and 8,430 independent clinical and anatomic pathology laboratories in the U.S. Dx competes with all of those laboratories.

Dx believes that the selection of a laboratory is primarily based on the following factors, all of which the Company believes it competes favorably in:

•quality, timeliness, and consistency in reporting test results;

•reputation of the laboratory in the medical community or field of specialty;

•contractual relationships with MCOs;

•service capability and convenience;

23

Index

•number and type of tests performed;

•connectivity solutions offered; and

•pricing of the laboratory’s services.

Dx believes that consolidation in the clinical laboratory testing business will continue. In addition, Dx believes that it and other large, independent clinical laboratory testing companies will be able to increase their share of the overall clinical laboratory testing market due to a number of factors, including cost efficiencies afforded by large-scale automated testing, mergers and acquisitions of complementary businesses, changes in payment models to performance and value-based reimbursement to deliver better outcomes at lower cost, and the increasing importance of large, integrated service networks. In addition, legal restrictions on physician referrals and physician ownership of laboratories, as well as ongoing regulation of laboratories, are expected to continue to contribute to the ongoing consolidation of the industry.

DD

 Drug development services companies like DD are also referred to as CROs and typically derive substantially all of their revenue from research and development (R&D), as well as marketing expenditures, of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries. 

Outsourcing of R&D services to CROs has increased in the past, and is expected to continue increasing in the future. Increasing pressures to improve return on investment, to increase R&D productivity, to stay abreast of scientific advances and to comply with stringent government regulations and attempts to reduce and control the price of prescription drugs have all contributed to this outsourcing to CROs. A CRO provides clients with flexibility in aligning resources to demand. In the face of mounting complexity, the investment and amount of time required to develop new products are significant and have been increasing. These trends create opportunities for DD and other CROs that can help make the development process more efficient.

The drug development industry has many participants ranging from hundreds of small providers to a limited number of large CROs with global capabilities. DD competes against these small and large CROs, as well as in-house departments of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical device and diagnostic companies, and to a lesser extent, selected academic research centers, universities and teaching hospitals.

DD believes that customers selecting a CRO often consider the following factors, all of which the Company believes it competes favorably in: 

•reputation for quality and regulatory compliance; 

•efficient, timely performance;

•expertise and experience in operations;

•application of technology and innovation;

•specific therapeutic and scientific expertise;

•data and analytical capabilities;

•post-approval and market access services; 

•ability to recruit patients;

•scope of service offerings; 

•strengths in various geographic markets; 

•price; 

•quality of facilities; 

•quality of relationships, including investigator and patient; 

•ability to manage large-scale clinical trials both domestically and internationally, including the recruitment of appropriate and sufficient clinical trial subjects; 

•size and scale;

•decentralized clinical trial capabilities;

•ability to develop companion diagnostics; and

•access to talent.

Quality

Dx and DD have comprehensive quality systems and processes appropriate for their respective businesses. The Company's quality programs are overseen by Dx's National Office of Quality, DD’s Global Regulatory Compliance and Quality Assurance Unit, DD's clinical trial services global vendor management department, DD's central laboratory services expanded laboratory management services department, and the Company's global supply chain management department and project management staff. The Company has procedures for monitoring its internal performance, as well as that of its vendors, suppliers, and other key stakeholders. In addition, various groups and departments within the Company provide oversight to monitor and control 

24

Index

vendor products and performance, and play an essential role in the Company’s approach to quality through improvements in processes and automation. 

Virtually all facets of the Company’s services are subject to quality programs and procedures, including accuracy and reproducibility of tests; turnaround time; customer service; data integrity; patient satisfaction; and billing. The Company’s quality programs include measures that compare current performance against desired performance goals to monitor critical aspects of service to its customers and patients. This includes licensing, credentialing, training and competency of professional and technical staff, and internal auditing. In addition to the Company's own quality programs, the Company’s laboratories, facilities and processes are subject to on-site regulatory agency inspections and accreditation evaluations, in addition to surveys and proficiency testing, by local or national government agencies; independent external accrediting programs; and inspections and audits by customers. 

Twenty eight of the Company's laboratories have received ISO-15189 accreditation, demonstrating that they meet international standards for quality and technical competence.

Information Systems 

The Company is committed to developing and commercializing technology-enabled solutions to support its operations and provide better care. The Company operates standard platforms for its core business services and its financial and reporting systems. These standard systems provide consistency within workflows and information as well as a high level of system availability, security, and stability. The primary laboratory systems include standardized support for molecular diagnostics, digital pathology and enhanced specialty laboratory solutions. The Company's centralized information systems are responsible for operational efficiencies, enabling the Company to achieve consistent, structured, and standardized operating results and effective patient care. 

In addition, the information systems used by Dx and DD are discussed in more detail in the sections dedicated to each of those segments.

Intellectual Property Rights

The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect its proprietary technology. The Company has filed and obtained numerous patents in the U.S. and abroad, and regularly files patent applications, when appropriate, to establish and protect its proprietary technology. Occasionally, the Company also licenses U.S. and non-U.S. patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others. The Company believes, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to its business as a whole.

Patents covering the Company's technologies are subject to challenges. Issued patents may be successfully challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or declared unenforceable so that patent rights would not create an effective competitive barrier. In addition, the laws of some countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. 

Parties may file claims asserting that the Company's technologies infringe on their intellectual property. The Company cannot predict whether parties will assert such claims against it, or whether those claims will harm its business. If the Company is forced to defend against such claims, the Company could face costly litigation and diversion of management’s attention and resources. As result of such disputes, the Company may have to develop costly non-infringing technology or enter into licensing agreements. These agreements, if necessary, may require financial or other terms that could have an adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.

Regulation and Reimbursement

General

Because the Company operates in a number of distinct environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, it is subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory requirements. Both the clinical laboratory industry and the drug development business are subject to significant governmental regulation at the national, state and local levels. As described below, these regulations concern licensure and operation of clinical laboratories, claim submission and reimbursement for laboratory services, healthcare fraud and abuse, drug development services, security and confidentiality of health information, quality, and environmental and occupational safety.

Regulation of Clinical Laboratories

Virtually all clinical laboratories operating in the U.S. must be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. In most cases, that certification is regulated by CMS through CLIA, which requires that applicable clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control, and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo 

25

Index

proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Clinical laboratories in locations other than the U.S. are generally subject to comparable regulation in their respective jurisdictions.

Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high-complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate-complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the FDA to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most CLIA requirements. All major and many smaller Company facilities hold CLIA certificates to perform high-complexity testing. The Company's remaining smaller testing sites hold CLIA certificates to perform moderate-complexity testing or a certificate of waiver. The sanctions for failure to comply with CLIA requirements include suspension, revocation, or limitation of a laboratory's CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business; cancellation or suspension of the laboratory's approval to receive Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement; as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could have a material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company is also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records.

The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all laboratory requirements applicable to its laboratories operating both within the U.S. and in other countries. The Company's laboratories have continuing programs to maintain operations in compliance with all such regulatory requirements, but no assurances can be given that the Company's laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections.

FDA and Other Regulatory Agency Laws and Regulations

Various regulatory agencies, including CMS and the FDA in the U.S., regulate the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution, storage, import, export, performance, and surveillance of diagnostic and therapeutic products and services, including certain products and services offered by the Company and the development of therapeutic products that comprise the majority of DD’s business. The FDA and other regulatory agencies periodically inspect and review the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic and therapeutic products, while CMS, certain state programs, and accreditation entities inspect and review the facilities, personnel, and procedures of clinical laboratories and their laboratory operations. The FDA and other regulatory agencies also periodically inspect clinical study sites and CROs that conduct clinical trials, including test facilities that perform tests on samples from human subjects enrolled in such clinical studies of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. These agencies have the authority to take various administrative and legal actions for noncompliance, such as fines, withdrawal of product approval, warning or untitled letters, seizures, recalls, injunctions, and other civil and criminal sanctions. 

Since 2014, there have been ongoing discussions and advocacy between stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory industry, the FDA, and Congress, about potential FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which are assays developed and performed in-house by clinical laboratories and can be made available to the public without pre-market review by the FDA (although COVID-19 diagnostic PCR LDTs have been subject to FDA pre-market requirements as a consequence of the national health emergency). Various regulatory and legislative proposals are under consideration, including some that could increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the Company is difficult to predict at this time.

There are similar national and regional regulatory agencies, and regulations, in the jurisdictions outside of the U.S. in which the Company operates. For example, the European Union In Vitro Diagnostics Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746 (EU IVDR)), scheduled to become applicable May 26, 2022, establishes a new legislative framework for in vitro diagnostic devices including a rule-based classification and quality and safety standards. The Company continues to assess and prepare for compliance with the EU IVDR, where applicable. 

DD’s laboratory facilities and Dx's clinical laboratory facilities that perform testing in support of clinical trials, must conform to a range of standards and regulations, including good laboratory practice (GLP) and good clinical practice (GCP), good manufacturing practice (cGMP), human subject protection and investigational product exemption regulations, and quality system regulation (QSR) requirements, as applicable. The preclinical and clinical studies that the Company conducts are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA as well as other regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates, which may include, without limitation, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the U.K., the European Medicines Agency, the National Medical Products Administration in China, and the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan, to determine compliance with GLP and GCP as well as other 

26

Index

applicable standards and regulations. If a regulatory agency determines during an inspection that the Company’s equipment, facilities, laboratories, operations, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and GLP and/or GCP standards, the regulatory agency may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. Noncompliance may result in, among other things, unanticipated compliance expenditures, or the regulatory agency seeking civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the Company, including suspension of its operations. 

Additionally, certain DD services and activities, such as chemistry, manufacturing, and controls (CMC) services and manufacturing of investigational medicinal products for use in certain Phase I studies managed by DD, must conform to cGMP. DD is subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and the MHRA, as well as other regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which the Company operates, in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. If a regulatory agency identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. Failure to maintain compliance with cGMP regulations and other applicable requirements of various regulatory agencies could result in, among other things, fines, warnings or untitled letters, unanticipated compliance expenditures, suspension of manufacturing, enforcement actions, product seizures or recalls, injunctions, or criminal prosecution. 

 Some Dx products are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA defines a medical device in part as an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article which is intended for the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in man. FDA regulates the development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post‑market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of products classified as medical devices separate from clinical diagnostic testing services offered under CLIA requirements. FDA regulatory requirements include: all of the relevant elements of the Quality System Regulation (which requires manufacturers to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures), labeling regulations, restrictions on promotion and advertising, Medical Device Reporting regulations (which requires the manufacturer to report to the FDA if its device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur), the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulations (which requires manufacturers to report certain recalls and field actions to the FDA), and other post-market requirements.

To ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, medical device manufacturers are subject to market surveillance and periodic, pre-scheduled and unannounced inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusal to grant clearance or approvals of new devices; withdrawal of clearance or approval; and civil or criminal prosecution. 

Animal Welfare Laws and Regulations

The conduct of animal research at DD’s facilities in the U.S. must be in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), which governs the care and use of warm-blooded animals for research in the U.S. other than laboratory rats, mice, and chickens, and is enforced through periodic inspections by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The AWA establishes facility standards regarding several aspects of animal welfare, including housing, ventilation, lighting, feeding and watering, handling, veterinary care, and recordkeeping. DD complies with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the USDA and similar agencies in foreign jurisdictions such as the European Union, the U.K., and China for the care and use of regulated species. If the USDA determines that DD’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable AWA standards, it may issue an inspection report documenting the deficiencies and setting deadlines for any required corrective actions. The USDA may impose fines, suspend and/or revoke licenses and registrations, or confiscate research animals. Other countries where the Company conducts business have similar laws and regulations with which the Company must also comply. In addition, certain of DD’s animal-related activities may be subject to regulation by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare of the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and similar organizations in other jurisdictions.

Payment for Clinical Laboratory Services

In 2021, Dx derived approximately 10.1% of its revenue directly from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs. In addition, Dx's other commercial laboratory testing business that is not directly related to Medicare or Medicaid nevertheless depends significantly on continued participation in these programs and in other government healthcare programs, in part because customers often want a single laboratory to perform all of their testing services. In recent years, both governmental and private-sector payers have made efforts to contain or reduce healthcare costs, including reducing reimbursement for clinical laboratory services.

Reimbursement under the Medicare PFS is capped at different rates in each Medicare Administrative Contractor's jurisdiction. Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement under the CLFS is set at a national rate that is updated every three years for most tests. State Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule limit for clinical laboratory services furnished to Medicaid recipients. Laboratories primarily bill and are reimbursed by Medicare and Medicaid directly for covered tests performed on behalf of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. For beneficiaries that participate in Managed Medicare and Managed Medicaid plans, laboratory bills are submitted to and paid by MCOs that manage those plans. Approximately 8.5% of Dx's revenue is reimbursed directly by Medicare under the CLFS.

Many pathology services performed by Dx are reimbursed by Medicare under the PFS. The PFS assigns relative value units to each procedure or service, and a conversion factor is applied to calculate the reimbursement. The PFS is also subject to adjustment on an annual basis. Such adjustments can impact both the conversion factor and relative value units. The Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR), the formula previously used to calculate the fee schedule conversion factor, would have resulted in significant decreases in payment for most physician services for each year since 2003. However, Congress intervened repeatedly to prevent these payment reductions, and the conversion factor was increased or frozen for the subsequent year. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA) permanently replaced the SGR formula and transitioned PFS reimbursement to a value-based payment system. MACRA retroactively avoided a 21.2% reduction in PFS reimbursement that had been scheduled for April 1, 2015, and provided for PFS conversion factor increases of 0.5% from July 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, and 0.5% in each of years 2016-2019, followed by no updates for 2020-2025, and updates that vary based on participation in alternative payment models in subsequent years. These changes to the conversion factor may be offset by reductions to the relative value units, as was the case with the 2016 PFS reductions. For 2022, Congress increased the conversion factor by 3.0% over the amount announced in the final rule, instead of allowing a 3.75% reduction to take effect. Approximately 0.4% of Dx's revenue is reimbursed under the PFS.

In addition to changes in reimbursement rates, Dx is also impacted by changes in coverage policies for laboratory tests and annual CPT coding revisions. Medicare, Medicaid and private payer diagnosis code requirements and payment policies negatively impact Dx's ability to be paid for some of the tests it performs. Further, some payers require additional information to process claims, employ third-party utilization management tools, or have implemented prior authorization policies which delay or prohibit payment. In 2021, there were limited coding and billing changes. While limited changes are expected to be implemented in 2022, the Company typically expects some delays in pricing and reimbursement as new codes are introduced.

Future changes in national, state and local laws and regulations (or in the interpretation of current regulations) affecting government payment for clinical laboratory testing could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 

Further healthcare reform could occur in 2022, including changes to the ACA and Medicare reform, as well as administrative requirements that may continue to affect coverage, reimbursement, and utilization of laboratory services in ways that are currently unpredictable. 

Privacy, Security and Confidentiality of Health Information and Other Personal Information

In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health information and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions. These regulations apply to health plans and healthcare providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and healthcare clearinghouses (covered entities). Six such regulations include: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule; (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule; and (vi) the Health Plan Identifier Rule. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with each of the HIPAA Rules identified above.

The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of PHI. 

On February 6, 2014, CMS and HHS published final regulations that amended the HIPAA Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to receive copies of their test reports from laboratories subject to HIPAA, or to request that copies of their test reports be transmitted to designated third parties. 

On December 12, 2018, HHS issued a request for information (RFI) seeking input from the public on how the HIPAA regulations and the Privacy Rule, in particular, could be modified to amend existing, or impose additional, obligations relating to the processing of PHI. Subsequent to the RFI, on January 21, 2021, HHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) containing potential modifications to the Privacy Rule addressing standards that may impede the transition to value-based 

28

healthcare and strengthen individuals' rights to access their health information. The public comment period for the NPRM was closed on May 6, 2021. The Company is monitoring the NPRM process. If modifications to the Privacy Rule are adopted, they may impact the Company's compliance obligations under HIPAA. 

The U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), which was enacted in February 2009, with regulations effective on September 23, 2013, strengthened and expanded the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also fundamentally changes a business associate’s obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when unsecured PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of a breach. 

 The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for healthcare providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identifier Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered healthcare providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain an NPI to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number and other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities for the purpose of identifying healthcare providers in standard electronic transactions. 

The Health Plan Identifier (HPID) was a unique identifier designed to furnish a standard way to identify health plans in electronic transactions. CMS published the final rule adopting the HPID for health plans required by HIPAA on September 12, 2012. Effective October 31, 2014, CMS announced a delay, until further notice, in enforcement of regulations pertaining to health plan enumeration and use of the HPID in HIPAA transactions adopted in the HPID final rule. On October 28, 2019, CMS published a final rule rescinding the adopted standard unique HPID and implementation specifications and requirements for its use and other entity identifier and implementation specifications for its use, effective December 27, 2019. This delay remains in effect. The Company will continue to monitor future developments related to the HPID and respond accordingly.

Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement by increasing the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, requiring HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents. 

The total cost associated with meeting the ongoing requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to the Company’s operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on the Company.

On May 1, 2020, HHS published a final rule making the information blocking provisions (Information Blocking Rules) of the 21st Century Cures Act effective on November 2, 2020. On November 4, 2020, HHS extended the effective date of the Information Blocking Rules to April 5, 2021. The Information Blocking Rules prohibit covered actors, including healthcare providers, from engaging in activity that is likely to interfere with the access, exchanges, or use of electronic health information (EHI) unless such activity falls into one of eight exceptions. The Information Blocking Rules provide for civil monetary penalties for noncompliance by healthcare IT vendors and, separately, “appropriate disincentives” for noncompliance by healthcare providers. The Company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Information Blocking Rules. 

In addition to the regulations described above, numerous other data protection, privacy and similar laws govern the confidentiality, security, use, and disclosure of personal information. These laws vary by jurisdiction, but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use, and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In the U.S., some state laws are more restrictive and, therefore, are not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory's licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties. 

Congress and state legislatures also have been implementing new legislation relating to privacy and data protection. For example, on June 28, 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA created transparency requirements and granted California residents several new rights with regard to their personal information. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) ballot initiative, which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA). The amendments introduced by the CPRA go into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential

statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. Other states have passed legislation similar to the CCPA, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA), effective January 1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA), effective July 1, 2023. Both the VCDPA and CPA heavily mirror the principles and requirements of the CCPA; however, neither provides for a private right of action. The Company implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and continues to assess the impact of the CPRA, VCDPA, and CPA on the Company’s business as additional information and guidance becomes available. 

Effective August 14, 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of HHS (SAMHSA) announced the finalization of proposed changes to the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulation, 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 2. This regulation protects the confidentiality of patient records relating to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment that are maintained in connection with the performance of any federally assisted program or activity relating to substance use disorder education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research. Under the regulation, patient identifying information may only be released with the individual’s written consent, subject to certain limited exceptions. The latest changes to this regulation seek to better facilitate care coordination, while maintaining more stringent confidentiality of substance use disorder information. The Company adopted changes to its policies and procedures necessary for compliance.

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Regulation (EU) 2016/679, became effective May 25, 2018, replacing Directive 95/46/EC. The GDPR established requirements applicable to the use and transfer of personal data and imposes penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR requires transparency with regard to the means and purposes of processing of personal data; collection of consent to process personal data in certain circumstances; the ability to provide records of processing upon request by a supervisory authority or data controller; implementation of appropriate technical and organizational measures to maintain security of personal data; notification of personal data breaches to supervisory authorities, data controllers, and individuals within expedient time frames; and performance of data protection impact assessments for certain processing activities. The GDPR also provides individual data subjects with certain rights, where applicable, including the right of access, the right to rectification, the right to be forgotten, the right to restrict or object to processing, and the right to data portability. The GDPR requires that personal data may only be transferred outside of the European Union to a country that offers an adequate level of data protection under standards set by the European Union, or where such transfer is otherwise pursuant to a legal framework approved by the European Union. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) released its decision in Data Protection Commission v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (Schrems II), which invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a legal framework for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union, and suggesting additional safeguards for the use of Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) as a legal framework for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission release updated SCCs, which, in part, adopted many of the additional safeguards highlighted in the Schrems II decision. Companies using SCCs for the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union are required to use the new SCCs for new transfers of personal data as of September 27, 2021, and for all transfers of personal data as of December 27, 2022. The Company has established processes and frameworks to manage compliance with the GDPR and other global privacy and data protection requirements, and to manage preparation for future enacted regulations. Compliance could impose significant costs on the Company.

In addition to the GDPR, numerous other countries have laws governing the collection, use, disclosure, and transmission (including cross-border transfer) of personal information, including medical information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection is complex and continually evolving. Data protection regulations have been enacted or updated in regions where the Company does business including in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, and in countries such as Canada, India, and the UK. Failure to comply with these regulations may result in, among other things, civil, criminal and contractual liability, fines, regulatory sanctions and damage to the Company’s reputation. 

Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations

Existing U.S. laws governing federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, OIG and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The U.S. government's enforcement efforts have been conducted under regulations such as HIPAA, which includes several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund U.S., state and local law enforcement efforts, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which includes requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the U.S. False Claims Act. Amendments to the False Claims Act, and other enhancements to the U.S. fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, have further increased fraud and abuse enforcement 

30

Index

efforts and compliance risks. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute. 

The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S. federal healthcare program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in U.S. federal healthcare programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations that specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government healthcare programs).

From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the healthcare industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other fraud and abuse laws. OIG Special Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions relevant to the Company set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the U.S. fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering or providing discounted laboratory services billed to referral sources in return for referrals of other tests that are billed to U.S. federal healthcare programs; (iii) providing free testing to physicians’ managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pickup and disposal of biohazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; (vi) providing free testing for healthcare providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing); (vii) rental of space in physician offices by equipment suppliers or other healthcare entities to which the physicians make referrals; (viii) compensation paid by laboratories to physicians for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries; and (ix) remuneration provided to physicians and other health care professionals by pharmaceutical and medical device companies in connection with company-sponsored speaker programs.

In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, in October 2018, the U.S. enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (EKRA), as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees is inconsistent with the federal anti-kickback statute and regulations, which permit payment of employee incentive compensation, a practice that is common in the industry. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued, and there is no additional DOJ or other government guidance to indicate how and to what extent it will be applied and enforced in the industry. The Company is working through its trade association to address the scope of EKRA.

Under another U.S. statute, known as the Stark Law or “physician self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or a compensation relationship with a commercial laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare or Medicaid patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: i) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; ii) payments by physicians to a laboratory for commercial laboratory services; iii) ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician's own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; iv) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and v) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.

In December 2020, the OIG and CMS published final rules to amend the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, respectively. The amendments were primarily intended to alleviate perceived impediments to coordinated care and value-based compensation arrangements through new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and new exceptions to the Stark Law, and have varying degrees of applicability to laboratories. The CMS final rule incorporates laboratories and permits support for value-based arrangements, under certain conditions for purposes of the Stark Law. However, the OIG final rule generally excludes laboratories from protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for 

31

Index

value-based arrangements. 

There are a variety of other types of U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims and that require certain companies to disclose payments and other transfers of value to certain healthcare professionals and providers. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws. The Company is unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that its arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other U.S. or state healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a U.S. healthcare program, or material loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on the Company's business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business.

Enrollment and re-enrollment in U.S. healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to certain program integrity requirements intended to protect the programs from fraud, waste, and abuse. In September 2019, CMS published a final rule implementing program integrity enhancements to provider enrollment requiring Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) providers and suppliers to disclose on an enrollment application or a revalidation application any current or previous direct or indirect affiliation with a provider or supplier that (1) has uncollected debt; (2) has been or is subject to a payment suspension under a federal health care program; (3) has been or is excluded by the OIG from Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP; or (4) has had its Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP billing privileges denied or revoked. This rule permits CMS to deny enrollment based on such an affiliation when CMS determines that the affiliation poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. CMS is phasing in this new affiliation disclosure requirement.

In November 2021, CMS published a final rule for the 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, which included further program integrity requirements. CMS finalized its proposal to expand the categories of parties within the purview of the denial and revocation provisions to include excluded administrative or management services personnel who furnish services payable by a federal healthcare program, such as a billing specialist, accountant, or human resources specialist. CMS also codified the billing privilege deactivation rebuttal process, under which a provider or supplier would have 15 calendar days from receipt of written notice of a deactivation to submit a rebuttal, and CMS could, in its discretion, extend the 15-day period to account for certain special situations. In addition, CMS defined factors it would use to determine whether revocation or suspension of billing privileges is appropriate due to a pattern or practice of non-compliant billing, which would be: (a) the percentage of submitted claims that were denied during the period under consideration; (b) whether the provider or supplier has any history of final adverse actions and the nature of any such actions; (c) the type of billing non-compliance and the specific facts surrounding said non-compliance (to the extent this can be determined); and (d) any other information regarding the provider's or supplier's specific circumstances that CMS deems relevant to the determination. This is a reduction in the number of factors that were previously considered and a revision of some previous factors. 

Environment, Health, and Safety

The Company is subject to licensing and requirements under laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations include the safe handling, use, transportation and disposal of potentially infectious and hazardous materials; the assessment of potential work-related risks and establishment of work practice and engineering controls, and providing protective clothing and equipment, training, and medical surveillance; designed to minimize risk to employee health and safety and the environment. 

The Company is committed to reducing its carbon footprint. Labcorp participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and the EcoVadis sustainable procurement rating processes and has committed to submitting a Science Based Target by the end of 2022. Energy-saving measures at Company facilities include for example, installation of more efficient boilers, chillers, ventilation systems and LED lighting, engaging in waste-to-energy disposition, and reducing waste going to landfills. Funding for these and similar projects continued through 2021 and are continuing in 2022.

The Company seeks to comply with all relevant environment, employee health and safety laws and regulations. Failure to comply could subject the Company to various administrative and/or other enforcement actions.  

Drug Testing

Drug testing for public sector employees is regulated by the SAMHSA, which has established detailed performance and quality standards that laboratories must meet to be approved to perform drug testing on employees of U.S. government contractors and certain other entities. To the extent that the Company’s laboratories perform such testing, each must be certified as meeting SAMHSA standards. The Company’s laboratories in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina; Raritan, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Southaven, Mississippi; and St. Paul, Minnesota are all SAMHSA certified. 

32

Index

Controlled Substances

DD handles controlled substances as part of the services it provides in preclinical testing and clinical trials. The use of controlled substances in testing for drugs of abuse is regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with these regulations as applicable. Violations of these rules may result in criminal and civil fines and penalties.

Compliance Program

The Company maintains a comprehensive, global compliance program that includes ongoing evaluation and monitoring of its compliance with the laws and regulations of the U.S. and the other countries in which it has operations. The objective of the Company’s compliance program is to develop, implement, monitor, and update compliance safeguards, as appropriate. Although the Company is subject to a broad range of regulations, its compliance program has a particular focus on regulations related to healthcare fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, physician self-referral, government reimbursement programs, anti-bribery/anti-corruption, anti-human trafficking, and trade sanctions, among others. Emphasis is placed on developing and implementing compliance policies and guidelines, personnel training programs, monitoring and auditing activities, and providing systems for reporting and investigation of potential or actual compliance concerns. The compliance program demonstrates the Company's commitment to conducting business at the highest standards of ethical conduct and integrity.

The Company seeks to conduct its business in compliance with all statutes, regulations, and other requirements applicable to its clinical laboratory operations and drug development business. The clinical laboratory industry and drug development industries are, however, subject to extensive regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. In addition, the applicability or interpretation of statutes and regulations may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science, healthcare technology, and healthcare organizations. Applicable statutes and regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would materially adversely affect the Company. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates, and authorizations necessary to operate, as well as potential liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.

Information Security

Information security is one of the Company's top priorities. Securing personal and health information is critical to the Company’s business operations and to future growth, as the Company is committed to using technology to improve the delivery of care. A security breach could have a material adverse operational, financial, regulatory, and reputational impact to the Company. The Company employs a secure technology framework that enables continuous operations of laboratory devices, computers, and communications systems. The Company has experienced and expects to continue to confront attempts by cybercriminals who seek access to its systems and data. 

The Company uses state-of-the art tools and advanced analytics to proactively identify and protect against potential information system disruptions and breaches; to monitor, test and secure key networks and services; and to facilitate prompt resumption of operations if a system disruption or interruption should occur. The Company has implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with global laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal and health information. Additionally, the Company maintains a comprehensive behavior management and communications program, which addresses the human element of cybersecurity by providing staff with extensive awareness, education, and training to help prevent cybercrime from succeeding through human error. 

The Company is exposed to risks related to information security arising from the information technology systems and operations of third parties, including the Company's vendors and partners. Therefore, a stringent process is followed for evaluating the cybersecurity status of vendors or third parties that will have access to the Company's data or information technology systems. The Company also carries cybersecurity and business interruption insurance.
