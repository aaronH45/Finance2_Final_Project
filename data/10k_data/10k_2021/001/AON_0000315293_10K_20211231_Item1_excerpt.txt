Item 1. Business

OVERVIEW

Aon plc (which may be referred to as “Aon,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, health, and wealth solutions. Through our experience, global reach, and comprehensive analytics, we are better able to help clients meet rapidly changing, increasingly complex, and interconnected challenges. We are committed to accelerating innovation to address unmet and evolving client needs, so that our clients are better informed, better advised, and able to make better decisions to protect and grow their business. Management is focused on strengthening Aon and uniting the firm with one portfolio of capability enabled by data and analytics and one operating model to deliver additional insight, connectivity, and efficiency.

Our clients are in over 120 countries and include all market segments and almost every industry. This diversification of our customer base helps provide us stability in different economic scenarios that could affect specific industries, customer segments, or geographies.

We have continued to focus our portfolio on higher-margin, capital-light professional services businesses that have high recurring revenue streams and strong cash flow generation. We endeavor to make capital allocation decisions based upon return on invested capital.

BUSINESS SEGMENT

The Company operates as one segment that includes all of Aon’s continuing operations, which, as a global professional services firm, provides advice and solutions to clients focused on risk, health and wealth through four principal products and services: Commercial Risk Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, Health Solutions, and Wealth Solutions. Collectively, these products and service lines make up our one segment: Aon United. In addition, the Company is continuing to expand on Aon United growth initiatives through its New Ventures Group.

In 2021, our consolidated total revenue was $12,193 million. This includes $6,635 million in Commercial Risk Solutions, $1,997 million in Reinsurance Solutions, $2,154 million in Health Solutions, and $1,426 million in Wealth Solutions, before intercompany eliminations.

In retail brokerage, our dedicated teams of risk professionals utilize comprehensive analytics capabilities and insights providing clients with risk advice for their organizations. We utilize Aon’s differentiated capabilities in industry sector- and segment-specific approaches to risk transfer options and deliver them through a variety of channels including bespoke solutions for complex needs, structured solutions for mid-market and small and medium-sized enterprises, and digital distribution including CoverWallet. Our specialty-focused organizational structure includes financial and professional lines, cyber, surety and trade credit, crisis management, transaction liability, and intellectual property. We develop market leading insights on the most efficient risk transfer vehicles for clients in today’s complex and integrated risk environment to enable clients to make better decisions. Global risk consulting and captive management is a global leader in supporting better management of companies’ risk profiles by identifying and quantifying the risks they face, mapping out optimal risk mitigation, retention and transfer solutions and thus enabling them to be more informed to make better decisions for their businesses. Affinity programs include development, marketing, and administration of customized and targeted insurance programs, facilities, and other structured solutions, including Aon Client Treaty. We collaborate with sponsors and other privileged distribution channels through which Aon can deliver differentiated, highly targeted, and highly valuable solutions for unique risk solutions.

This includes the development of more competitive, innovative, and efficient risk transfer options. Facultative reinsurance empowers clients to better understand, manage, and transfer risk through innovative facultative solutions and provides the most efficient access to the global facultative reinsurance markets. Capital markets is a global investment bank with expertise in insurance-linked securities, capital raising, strategic advice, restructuring, and mergers and acquisitions.

We partner with clients to deliver our scale and experience to help them effectively manage their investments, risk, and governance and potentially lower costs. We believe in the power of connecting participants to experts to make better informed and smarter decisions about their wealth.

Revenue and Compensation

Our business generates revenues primarily through commissions, compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies for services we provide to them, and fees from customers. Commissions and fees for brokerage services vary depending upon several factors, which may include the amount of premium, the type of insurance or reinsurance coverage provided, the particular services provided to a client, insurer, or reinsurer, and the capacity in which we act. Compensation from insurance and reinsurance companies includes: (1) fees for consulting and analytics services, and (2) fees and commissions for administrative and other services provided to or on behalf of insurers and reinsurers. Fees from clients for advice and consulting services are dependent on the extent and value of the services we provide. Payment terms are consistent with current industry practices.

Funds Held on Behalf of Clients

We typically hold funds on behalf of clients, including premiums received from clients and claims due to clients that are in transit to and from insurers. Certain funds held on behalf of clients are invested in interest-bearing premium trust accounts and can fluctuate significantly depending on when we collect and remit cash. The principal is segregated and not available for general operating purposes, although we may earn interest on these accounts.

Competition

Our business operates in a highly competitive and fragmented environment. We compete with numerous other global insurance brokers and consulting companies, including Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., WTW, Arthur J Gallagher & Company, and Lockton Companies, Inc., as well as numerous other global specialist, regional, and local firms in almost every area of our business. We also compete with insurance and reinsurance companies that directly market and service their insurance products without the assistance of brokers or agents. Additionally, we compete with other businesses that do not fall into the categories above, including large financial institutions and independent consulting firms and consulting organizations affiliated with accounting, information systems, technology, and financial services firms.

Seasonality

Due to buying patterns and delivery of certain products and services in the markets we serve, revenues recognized tend to be higher in the first and fourth quarters of each fiscal year.

Licensing and Regulation

Our business activities are subject to licensing requirements and extensive regulation under the laws of countries in which we operate, including U.S. federal and state laws. See the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report for information regarding how actions by regulatory authorities or changes in legislation and regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate may have an adverse effect on our business.

Regulatory authorities in the U.S. and most other countries in which our operating subsidiaries conduct business may require individuals, entities and related service providers to obtain a license from a government agency, including (but not limited to) licenses to operate as insurance producers, brokers, agents, and consultants, reinsurance brokers or managing general agents. 

Certain jurisdictions issue licenses only to resident entities or individuals. In such jurisdictions, if the Company has no licensed subsidiary, we may maintain arrangements with residents or business entities licensed to act in such jurisdiction. Such arrangements are subject to an internal review and approval process. 

Our subsidiaries must comply with laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which they do business. These laws and regulations are enforced by the FCA in the U.K., by federal and state agencies in the U.S., and by various regulatory agencies and other supervisory authorities in other countries through the granting and revoking of licenses to do business, the licensing of agents, the monitoring of trade practices, policy form approval, limits on commission rates, and mandatory remuneration disclosure requirements.

Insurance authorities in the U.K., U.S., and certain other jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate have enacted laws and regulations governing the investment of funds, such as premiums and claims proceeds, held in a fiduciary capacity for others. These laws and regulations generally require the segregation of these fiduciary funds and limit the types of investments that may be made with them.

Investment, securities, and futures licensing authorities also govern certain business activities. For example, in the U.S., we use Aon Securities LLC, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Aon, and a U.S.-registered broker-dealer and investment advisor, member of FINRA and Securities Investor Protection Corporation, for investment banking, capital advisory services and other broker-dealer activities. Similar operations exist in other jurisdictions outside of the U.S.

Further, pension and financial laws and regulations, including oversight and supervision by the FCA in the U.K., the SEC in the U.S., and regulators in other countries govern certain of the retirement-related consulting services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes Aon subsidiaries that provide investment advisory services regulated by various U.S. federal authorities including the SEC and FINRA, as well as authorities on the state level. In addition, other services provided by Aon and its subsidiaries and affiliates, such as trustee services and retirement and employee benefit program administrative services, are subject in various jurisdictions to pension, investment, securities, and insurance laws and regulations, and supervision.

Clientele

Our clients operate in many businesses and industries throughout the world. No one client accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated total revenues in 2021. Additionally, we place insurance with many insurance carriers, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of the total premiums we placed on behalf of our clients in 2021.

Human Capital Management

Our Culture

Our culture is driven by our values – committed as one firm to our purpose, united through trust as one inclusive, diverse team, and passionate about making our colleagues and clients successful. Our colleagues are the cornerstone of Aon's success. Collaboration and innovation drive our culture, bringing the best of Aon to clients in a holistic and seamless manner. Our Delivering Aon United strategy defines how Aon colleagues work together to deliver value to clients, setting a new standard for client leadership. Delivering Aon United is brought to life through our common client value creation model which scales strategies from across the firm to bring the best of Aon to clients.

Colleagues

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 50,000 employees and conducted our operations in more than 120 countries and territories. Our colleagues’ diverse talents, expertise, and insights contribute to the success of both our firm and our clients, and we seek to attract, grow, and retain the best talent in the industry. Our Inclusive People Leadership strategy is a central part of our Aon United Blueprint and is a key enabler to realizing our aspirations and purpose as a firm. At Aon, all colleagues are called upon to be leaders in embracing and modelling our Aon United values and behaviors. Inclusive People Leadership at Aon ensures that all colleagues – at every stage of their career journey – are equipped and motivated to deliver on our purpose and able to achieve their full potential.

Training and Development

We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain at the forefront of innovation and make Aon an attractive employer. Colleagues are invited to complete a variety of curricula to meet their career stage goals and developmental needs. We provide our colleagues what they need to learn, grow, and become the leaders our clients seek. From self-guided Aon University courses to advanced learning programs, the curriculum is aligned to the Aon United Blueprint and Inclusive People Leader strategy. While the COVID-19 pandemic changed how our colleagues work and collaborate, it did not slow us down. Aon’s investment in technology and use of virtual based learning and development programs during the pandemic has allowed us to continue these efforts despite much of our workforce remaining virtual during 2021.

Colleague Engagement and Retention

Providing an engaging and rewarding colleague experience is a top priority for our firm and understanding colleagues’ feedback helps us reach that goal. We use a variety of channels to facilitate open, on-going, and direct communication with colleagues. These channels include open forums and town halls with executives, surveys, and engagement through our Business Resource Groups. Business Resource Groups are our independent, voluntary, non-profit associations that provide input, take action, and help identify opportunities for our firm to further its diversity and inclusion commitments. 

In response to the challenging events of 2020, we updated our engagement survey process by offering more frequent pulse surveys to understand how colleagues are engaging with their teams, the firm, and clients. This outreach effort allows us to gather insights more rapidly and take timely action to address feedback. Our current practice is to conduct pulse surveys with subsets of the overall colleague population approximately six to eight times per year on timely or targeted issues, as well as an annual all-colleague engagement survey. The pulse surveys for 2021 were focused on topics such as manager and leadership support, especially in how we serve clients, colleague well-being, inclusion and diversity, and performance & rewards. Aon’s workforce feedback provides management a better understanding of evolving colleague viewpoints, and ensures we are taking appropriate steps to drive colleague engagement and retention. For discussion of the risks related to the attraction and retention of senior management and other professional personnel, see the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this report. 

Rewards

In addition to an inspired purpose and culture, we are proud to offer our colleagues a total rewards program that combines competitive pay, incentive opportunities, and benefits. Our compensation programs, including salary, recognition, cash and equity incentives, connect to our formal performance management and career development approach. These programs serve to reward colleagues for their impact both in what they accomplish for clients, colleagues, and shareholders and how they achieve those results. We maintain a global commitment to colleague well-being and play a key role in supporting colleagues across the physical, emotional, financial, and social spectrum. Our comprehensive benefit programs are competitive for the markets in which we operate and aligned with our values and culture. 

In recognition of our colleagues’ role in growing the firm, we introduced the Aon United Growth Ownership Plan in 2021. Through the plan, all eligible colleagues that were active on September 24, 2021, received a one-time, stock-based award, enabling Aon colleagues to share in the future success of our Aon United mission.

Our compensation philosophy aligns with our Aon United strategy and delivering long-term shareholder value creation. Our executive incentives are based on driving results, delivery of strategic initiatives, and leadership. Beginning in 2021, 20% of the short-term incentives for senior executives are based on quantifiable performance against firm-wide Inclusion and Diversity initiatives.

Inclusion and Diversity

We believe that diverse, inclusive teams produce better insight, better solutions, and ultimately the best outcomes for clients and Aon’s long-term success. 

10

We are focused on being a firm that is representative of the communities in which we operate. We achieve this by aligning I&D actions to the following pillars: Recruitment, Education, Promotion, and Representation. We strongly believe that only when colleagues can be their authentic selves will they reach their full potential.

Our commitment to I&D starts from the top with our Board of Directors, including its I&D Sub-Committee. Our Global Inclusive Leadership Council is sponsored by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief People Officer. Regional Inclusive Leadership Councils and our Executive Leadership Teams drive actions to increase the diversity of our teams, and colleague-led Business Resource Groups support execution and provide additional opportunities for colleagues to enhance our inclusive environment.

As of December 31, 2021, Aon’s global workforce was 54% women and 46% men, and the Aon Executive Committee which leads the firm was 45% women and 55% men. At the manager level, 26% of senior leaders and 42% of managers with one or more direct report were women. New colleague hires for the year were 52% women and 48% men. Aon’s U.S. workforce was 24% racially or ethnically diverse, calculated as a percentage of colleagues that have voluntarily disclosed their race or ethnicity to Aon. At the manager level, 13% of U.S. senior leaders and 17% of U.S. managers with one or more direct report were racially or ethnically diverse. New colleague hires for the year in the U.S. were 34% racially or ethnically diverse.

Our Apprenticeship Program

Apprenticeship programs help build a talent pipeline of highly skilled and diverse professionals while providing apprentices with advanced education and work experience. By removing some of the traditional barriers to entry-level employment, Aon can contribute to local workforce development and cultivate talent while improving retention rates in these entry-level roles. As a founding member of six apprentice networks within the U.S., we partner with companies and organizations to assist them in building their own programs through sharing best practices and learnings. Across these networks, we have over 100 organizations committed as of December 31, 2021.

Aon's two-year Apprenticeship Program, which was implemented in the U.K. and U.S. in 2012 and 2017, respectively, serves as an alternate route into a permanent role that normally requires a specific degree or professional experience. Aon provides motivated, high-potential individuals with the required training (on the job and in the classroom), professional skills development, mentorship, and experiential learning to bridge the gap. Over 440 Aon apprentices have been hired since the inception of the program across the U.S. and U.K. Both programs are certified apprenticeship programs, by the Department of Labor in the U.S. and the Department of Education in the U.K. In 2021, we expanded our U.S. program to include additional U.S. cities outside of Chicago's metropolitan area to the following six metropolitan areas hiring over 100 apprentices and partnering with seven additional community colleges: Houston, Minneapolis, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and Washington, DC.
