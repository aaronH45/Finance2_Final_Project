DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Overview

The Company was founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Washington under the guiding principle that success would come by offering customers the very best service, selection, quality and value. We aspire to be the best fashion retailer in a digitally-connected world by leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise for women, men, young adults and children focused on apparel, shoes, beauty, accessories and home goods. No matter how customers choose to shop, we are committed to delivering superior service, product and experience, including alterations, order pickup, dining and styling, to make shopping fun, personalized and convenient.

Nordstrom is a leading destination for a breadth of products across brands, styles and prices complemented by unmatched services and experiences. Nordstrom includes the following digital and physical properties:

•Nordstrom.com website and mobile application

•Nordstrom.ca website

•TrunkClub.com website

•94 Nordstrom stores in the U.S.

•six Nordstrom stores and seven Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada

•seven Nordstrom Locals

Nordstrom Rack is a premier off-price destination with an industry-leading off-price digital presence, offering in-demand product and a treasure hunt experience at compelling prices. Nordstrom Rack includes the following digital and physical properties:

•NordstromRack.com website and mobile application

•240 Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S.

•two Last Chance clearance stores

Nordstrom Rack purchases merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried at Nordstrom and also serves as an outlet for clearance merchandise from the Nordstrom banner. We plan to expand our offerings of the most coveted brands we carry, as well as source from new vendors, to ensure we have the selection our customers want. Currently, NordstromRack.com offers both a selection of Nordstrom Rack merchandise and limited-time flash sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands, which formerly existed on HauteLook.com prior to the first quarter of 2021 when it was consolidated into NordstromRack.com.

As a business, one of our key advantages lies in our ability to leverage an integrated network of physical and digital assets across both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack banners. This creates flexibility and convenience for our customers, no matter how they choose to shop – online, through our apps or in stores. This omni-channel platform is our differentiator, providing customers with four times more product available for next day pickup, the ability to pickup or return orders to any store location regardless of purchase origin, and our suite of personalized services.

As our business evolves, our market strategy is a key strategic growth priority. Our strategy leverages a strong store fleet and links our omni-channel capabilities at the local market level, positioning us physically closer to the customer and allowing us to drive customer engagement through better service and greater access to product. There are two elements to this strategy: first, we aim to provide customers a greater selection of merchandise available for next-day pickup or delivery without increasing inventory levels. Second, we are increasing engagement with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional convenient locations. In 2021, we expanded our strategy to 20 of our top markets, which encompass approximately 75% of our revenues.

We also receive credit card revenue through our program agreement with TD, whereby TD is the exclusive issuer of our consumer credit cards and we perform account servicing functions. Credit card revenues, net include our portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, pursuant to our program agreement with TD.

Products

In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. Additionally, we utilize alternative vendor partnership models beyond traditional wholesale arrangements that provide a broader assortment in new and existing categories without a corresponding increase in owned inventory. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise.

Nordstrom Rack invests in pack and hold inventory, which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons or to minimize inventory gaps from supply chain disruptions, allowing us to buy larger quantities of relevant items when available, then hold a portion of it to deploy in periods with high demand, tight supply or system constraints. This inventory is typically held for six months on average. 

Return Policy

We have a fair and reasonable approach to returns, handling them on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy. Almost all merchandise can be returned by mail or at any store location. We have no formal policy on how long we accept returns at Nordstrom stores, Nordstrom.com or Nordstrom.ca. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. Trunk Club allows customers five days from delivery to decide what items they would like to keep or send back for free if the items are in original condition. Trunks can be returned via mail or at any Nordstrom store. Our Nordstrom Rack stores and NordstromRack.com generally accept returns of apparel, footwear, accessories and home products up to 45 days from the date of purchase or date of shipment with the original price tag and sales receipt.

Loyalty Program

The Nordy Club is our customer loyalty program that incorporates a traditional point and benefit system, while providing customers exclusive access to products and events, enhanced services, personalized experiences and more convenient ways to shop. Customers accumulate points based on their level of spending and type of participation. Upon reaching certain point thresholds, customers receive Nordstrom Notes, which can be redeemed for goods or services across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack. The Nordy Club benefits vary based on the level of customer spend, and include Bonus Points days and shopping and fashion events.

We offer customers access to a variety of payment products and services, including a selection of Nordstrom-branded Visa® credit cards in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a Nordstrom-branded private label credit card for Nordstrom purchases. When customers use a Nordstrom-branded credit or debit card, they also participate in The Nordy Club and receive additional benefits, which can vary depending on the level of spend, including early access to the Anniversary Sale, enhanced alteration and stylist benefits and incremental accumulation of points toward Nordstrom Notes. 

Supply Chain Network

Our Supply Chain Network consists of: 

•fulfillment centers that primarily process and ship orders to our customers

•distribution centers that primarily process and ship merchandise to our stores and other facilities

•omni-channel centers that both fulfill customer orders and ship merchandise to our stores

We are continually expanding and enhancing our Supply Chain Network facilities and inventory management systems to support our omni-channel capabilities and provide greater access to merchandise selection and faster delivery. We select locations and customize inventory allocations to enable merchandise to flow more efficiently and quickly to our customers. Nordstrom online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom stores, distribution centers or omni-channel centers. Nordstrom in-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but when inventory is unavailable at that store, it may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers, distribution centers, omni-channel centers or from other Nordstrom stores. Nordstrom Rack online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers and distribution centers, but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom Rack stores. Both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack selectively use vendor dropship to supplement online offerings, which are then shipped directly from the vendor to the end customer.

Our first large-scale omni-channel center in Riverside, California, which supports our Nordstrom customers in the West Coast region, opened in 2020. Nordstrom Rack inventory and fulfillment will be added to this facility in the future. Our smaller Local Omni-channel Hub in Torrance, California was opened in 2019 and supports the greater Los Angeles market as part of our market strategy and has highly curated inventory that serves the specialized needs of that market. 

EMPLOYEES

We believe that creating an outstanding customer experience begins with creating an environment that celebrates and supports all employees. As we strive to attract and retain the best talent in the industry, we are committed to cultivating a workplace culture in which each of our employees is supported and feels confident bringing their full self to work.

In 2021, we employed an average of 60,000 full- and part-time employees. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 72,000 for the holiday season. All of our employees are non-union. 

Diversity, Inclusion & Belonging 

Our diversity, inclusion and belonging strategy focuses on four pillars: 

•Talent — increasing demographic diversity among our employees

•Culture — cultivating a greater sense of belonging throughout our organization

•Marketplace — consistently serving our customers through a lens of anti-racism and equity

•Leadership — setting consistent, future-oriented expectations for our leaders 

Over the past several years, we amplified our efforts in these areas and set specific goals to achieve by the end of 2025, which include: 

•Doubling our charitable giving to nonprofit organizations that promote anti-racism, bringing that total to approximately $1 million a year. 

•Delivering $500 million in retail sales from brands owned by, operated by or designed by Black and/or Latinx individuals. 

•Increasing representation of Black and Latinx individuals in people-manager roles by at least 50%.

•Leveraging our internship program and other initiatives to help us reach qualified candidates early in their careers, with a goal on average of at least 50% of participants in these programs coming from underrepresented populations.

We monitor and track progress against our strategy. Leading this work and driving accountability is our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Action Council, co-chaired by Erik B. Nordstrom, Chief Executive Officer, Peter E. Nordstrom, President and Chief Brand Officer and Farrell Redwine, Chief Human Resources Officer. The Council brings together a diverse mix of leaders from across our Company and a representative from our Board of Directors to monitor, assess and measure outcomes on Company-wide programs that drive our strategy forward.

Our Culture

We recognize the need for our employees to feel a sense of belonging and connection, especially throughout the past two years of continued isolation. One way we seek to facilitate this sense of connection is through our eight employee-led, Nordstrom-sponsored Employee Resource Groups that represent a variety of seen and unseen identities and serve to advance understanding and celebrate voices from across our organization.

Looking ahead, we are committed to strengthening our employees’ sense of belonging. We survey all employees annually regarding their sense of inclusion and psychological safety at work. With greater understanding of employees' challenges and perspectives, we can work toward building an ever-more supportive and inclusive culture. 

Employee Safety and Well-being 

The health and safety of our customers, employees and communities is something we take very seriously. At the onset of the pandemic, we worked quickly to close our stores, find new ways to support and protect our teams and customers and keep our employees informed throughout a tumultuous period. 

When our stores reopened, we implemented robust health and safety measures designed to keep our teams and our customers safe, including social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, sanitizing and daily health screenings. We also installed health advisors in each store location, fulfillment center and distribution center to support our employees and keep them informed. We continue to adjust our approach to health and safety in keeping with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local jurisdictional guidance and are prepared to make changes as the situation continues to evolve. 

The pandemic also underscored the importance of supporting our employees’ mental well-being in addition to their physical safety. We continue to offer a variety of mental, emotional and physical wellness resources to support our employees. 

Total Rewards 

To support our goals to retain and attract talented employees, we review our benefits and compensation approach annually. 

•Benefits: We offer a range of benefits to all employees upon meeting eligibility requirements, including health care, wellness programs, financial/retirement plans and time away. Throughout 2021, we provided a short-term disability paid benefit for employees with a confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 diagnosis, high-risk employees and employees who had first degree exposure. We also provided paid time off to quarantine following potential COVID-19 exposure in the workplace, and vaccination pay for employees to receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. In addition, we increased our focus on well-being by activating a multi-year strategy to bring our people new resources and tools to support total well-being including mental health support. 

•Compensation: We regularly review our pay in the markets in which we operate to ensure we are competitive, and update accordingly throughout the year.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

We believe we have a responsibility to support the many people and communities we serve. In 2020, we updated our Corporate Social Responsibility strategy with a new set of five-year goals focused on environmental sustainability, human rights and corporate philanthropy. These goals guide us as we work to address areas where our Company and industry have the most impact to create positive change.

In 2021, we made meaningful progress to advance our commitment toward responsible business. Specific highlights include: 

•Human Rights: We audited Nordstrom Made factories for compliance with our Partner Code of Conduct and implemented corrective action plans where necessary. We also strengthened our policies and programs to enhance human rights protections and launched a human rights impact assessment. 

•Women’s Rights: This year we hit a milestone: nearly 45% of Nordstrom Made products were produced in factories that offer women’s empowerment training, bringing us closer to our goal of producing 90% of Nordstrom Made products in factories that invest in women's empowerment by 2025. 

•Charitable Giving: We donated nearly $11 million to over 320 organizations located in communities where we operate. Our employees gave donations and volunteered their time to over 2,700 qualifying nonprofits and other organizations, many of which were supported with Company matching. Together with our customers and our employees, we used our platform to drive more than $14 million in nonprofit donations across the U.S. and Canada.

•Environmental Sustainability: We kept approximately 290 tons of clothing out of landfills through donation, resale or refurbishment, exceeding our goal of 250 tons. We also expanded BEAUTYCYCLE, our in-store beauty take-back and recycling program, to our Canadian stores, and took back over five tons of beauty packaging.

TRADEMARKS

Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Trunk Club, Zella, BP., Treasure & Bond, Halogen, Abound and Caslon. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.

SEASONALITY

Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations and cyclical trends in consumer spending. Our sales are typically higher in our second quarter, which usually includes most of the Anniversary Sale, and in our fourth quarter due to the holidays. In 2021, approximately one week of the Anniversary Sale shifted into our third quarter, and in 2020, as a result of COVID-19, the Anniversary Sale fell entirely in our third quarter. Results for any one quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to the Anniversary Sale, and we purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (typically from late November through December). Consistent with our seasonal fluctuations, our working capital requirements have historically increased during the months leading up to the Anniversary Sale and the holidays as we purchase inventory in anticipation of increased sales.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We regularly compete with other international, national, regional and local retailers, including internet-based businesses, omni-channel department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores and boutiques, which may carry similar lines of merchandise. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are what will always matter most to our customers: providing compelling product and outstanding service, both digitally and in stores, backed by people who care. This includes serving customers on their terms by providing a seamless digital and physical experience, offering compelling, curated and quality products across a range of price points, and by strategically partnering with relevant and limited distribution brands, all in top markets.
