Item 1. BUSINESS

Forward-Looking Statements

The U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a “safe harbor” for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information, so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those disclosed in the statement. Certain information of a non-historical nature contained in Items 1, 2, 3 and 7 of this Form 10-K includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding future financial performance, and the objectives and expectations of management. Forward-looking statements often include words such as “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks” or words of similar meaning, or future or conditional verbs, such as “will,” “should,” “could” or “may.” Forward-looking statements are neither historical facts nor assurances of future performance. Instead, such statements, including, but not limited to, our statements regarding business strategy, growth strategy, competitive strengths, productivity and profitability enhancement, competition, new product and service introductions and liquidity and capital resources, are based only on our current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding the future of our business, future plans and strategies, projections, anticipated events and trends, the economy and other future conditions, as well as on assumptions made by and information currently available to management, and involve various risks and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control.

Because forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control. Our actual results and financial condition may differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Therefore, you should not place undue reliance on any of these forward-looking statements. Any number of factors could affect our actual results and cause such results to differ materially from those contemplated by any forward-looking statements. Reference is made to “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K, for a discussion of certain factors that could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking information will in fact prove to be accurate. The order in which these factors appear should not be construed to indicate their relative importance or priority. We caution that these factors may not be exhaustive, accordingly, any forward-looking statements contained herein should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual results.

You should carefully consider these and other relevant factors and information which may be contained in this Form 10-K and in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, when reviewing any forward-looking statement. Investors should understand it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors or risks. As such, you should not consider the risks identified in our SEC filings, to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties.

Any forward-looking statement made in this Form 10-K is based only on information currently available to us and speaks only as of the date on which it is made. We do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to any forward-looking statements whether written or oral, that may be made from time to time, whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise.

General

Patterson Companies, Inc. is a value-added specialty distributor serving the U.S. and Canadian dental supply markets and the U.S., Canadian and U.K. animal health supply markets. Patterson operates through its two strategic business units, Patterson Dental and Patterson Animal Health, offering similar products and services to different customer bases. Each business has a strong competitive position, serves a highly fragmented market that offers consolidation opportunities and offers relatively low-cost consumable supplies, which makes our value-added business proposition highly attractive to our customers. We believe that we have a strong brand identity as a value-added, full-service distributor with broad product and service offerings, having begun distributing dental supplies in 1877.

Impacts of COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic, including closures and other steps taken by governmental authorities in response to the virus, has had a significant impact on our businesses. In March 2020, based upon the recommendations of the 

3
American Dental Association, the American Veterinary Medical Association and such organizations’ state-level counterparts, various dental and veterinary offices announced that they were performing only emergency or limited procedures, and rescheduled wellness exams and other elective procedures. In addition, many states and countries imposed restrictions on business operations to protect public health. Finally, the pandemic disrupted meat packing operations, which impacted our Animal Health segment. 

In response, management adapted our business practices with respect to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. Management also took proactive steps with respect to our liquidity position and near-term cost structure, including through incremental borrowings on our revolving credit facility to increase cash, reduction of non-critical capital expenditures, executive, board, and other senior-level employee compensation reductions, employee furloughs, discretionary spending deferrals and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act.

In our markets of the U.S., Canada, and the UK, restrictive measures have now been lifted or are expected to be lifted soon, sometimes subject to social distancing and capacity restrictions, due to the rapid pace of vaccination and improving local case rates. However, other areas around the world continue to suffer. Concerns remain that our markets could see a resurgence of cases triggering another shutdown, for example due to the emergence of a variant not effected by existing vaccines. In addition, COVID-19 continues to have a material effect on the macroeconomic environment, and there is continued uncertainty around its duration and ultimate impact.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report for further information on the impacts to our business and results of operations, our dividends, liquidity and debt arrangements, and associated risks and uncertainties.

Business Overview

The following table sets forth consolidated net sales (in millions) by segment. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our strategically located fulfillment centers enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs. Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.

Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of dental and animal health supply and distribution relationships. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition. The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore methods to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

Patterson became publicly traded in 1992 and is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Minnesota. We are headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota. Our principal executive offices are located at 1031 Mendota Heights Road, St. Paul, Minnesota 55120, and our telephone number is (651) 686-1600. Unless the context specifically requires otherwise, the terms the “Company,” “Patterson,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean Patterson Companies, Inc., a Minnesota corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.

The Specialty Distribution Markets We Serve

We provide manufacturers with cost effective logistics and high-caliber sales professionals to access a geographically diverse customer base, which is critical to the supply chain for the markets we serve. We provide our customers with an array of value-added services, a dedicated and highly skilled sales team, and a broad selection of products through a single channel, thereby helping them efficiently manage their ordering process. Due in part to the inability of our customers to store and manage large quantities of supplies at their locations, the distribution of supplies and small equipment has been characterized by frequent, small-quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially-complete order fulfillment. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue as distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seek to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

Dental Supply Market

The dental supply market we serve consists of geographically dispersed and highly fragmented dental practices. Customers range in size from sole practitioners to large group practices, often called Dental Service Organizations ("DSO's"). According to the American Dental Association and the Canadian Dental Association, there are approximately 202,000 dentists practicing in the U.S. and 21,000 dentists practicing in Canada. We believe the average dental practitioner purchases supplies from more than one supplier.

We believe the North American dental supply market continues to experience growth due to an increasing population, an aging population, advances in dentistry, demand for general, preventive and specialty services, increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, demand for infection control products, and insurance coverage by dental plans.

We support dental professionals through the many stock keeping units (“SKUs”) that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including equipment and technology installation and service, practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services, and continuing education, all designed to help make a dental practice more efficient.

Animal Health Supply Market

The animal health supply market is a mix of production animal supply, which primarily serves food producing animals, consisting of beef and dairy cattle, swine and poultry and other species such as sheep and goats, and companion animal supply, which serves pets, primarily dogs, cats and horses. Similar to the dental supply market, the animal health supply market is highly fragmented and diverse. Our production animal customers include large animal veterinarians, beef producers (cow/calf, stocker and feedlots), dairy producers, poultry producers, swine producers and retail customers. Our companion animal customers are primarily small animal and equine veterinary clinics, including independently owned, corporates and groups. According to the American Veterinary Medical Association, there are more than 70,000 veterinarians in private practice in the U.S. and Canada. Furthermore, there are approximately 20,000 veterinarians in the U.K. practicing in veterinary outlets; however, we believe there has been a shift in the U.K. market toward consolidation of veterinary practices. National Veterinary Services Limited, is the market leader in the U.K. veterinary market, with the highest percentage of buying groups and corporations as customers compared to its competitors, and the highest share position in that country overall.

The global animal health supply market continues to experience growth, and we believe that trend will continue for the foreseeable future. We support our animal health customers through the distribution of biologicals, pharmaceuticals, parasiticides, supplies, including our own private label brands, and equipment. We also supply a full portfolio of technologies, software, services and solutions to all segments and channels of our broad customer base. We actively engage in the development, sale and distribution of inventory, accounting and health management systems to enhance customer operating efficiencies and assist our customers in managing risk. Within the companion animal supply market, we anticipate increasing demand for veterinary services due to the following factors: the increasing number of households with companion animals, increased pet adoption rates and increased expenditures on animal health and preventative care, an aging pet population, advancements in animal health products and diagnostic testing, and extensive marketing programs sponsored by companion animal nutrition and pharmaceutical companies.

5
We anticipate the macroeconomic trend of global population growth and corresponding demand for protein will be favorable to the production animal segment in the future. Likewise, the rise in disposable income, especially in developing countries will be a key driver of future growth. However; product sales in the production animal supply market are more likely to be impacted by volatility in the market such as commodity prices, changes in weather patterns, and trends in the general economy. Many factors can influence how long cattle will graze and consequently the number of days an animal is on feed during a finishing phase. Supply and demand dynamics and economic trends can shift the number of animals treated, the timing of when animals are treated, to what extent they are treated and with which products they are treated. Historically, sales in this market have been largely driven by spending on animal health products to improve productivity, weight gain and disease prevention, as well as a growing focus on health and wellness of the animals, safety, and efficiency in livestock production.

Competition

The distribution industry is highly competitive. It consists principally of national, regional and local full-service distributors. Substantially all of the products we sell are available to customers from a number of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products. Some manufacturers also sell directly to end-users, thereby eliminating or reducing our role and that of other distributors.

We compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental and animal health products, on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services. To differentiate ourselves from our competition we deploy a strategy of premium customer service with multiple value-added components, a highly qualified and motivated sales force, highly-trained and experienced service technicians, an extensive breadth and mix of products and services, technology solutions allowing customers to easily access our inventory, accurate and timely delivery of product, strategic location of sales offices and fulfillment centers, and competitive pricing.

In the U.S. and Canadian dental supply market, we compete against Henry Schein, Inc., Benco Dental Supply Company, Burkhart Dental Supply and hundreds of distributors that operate on a regional or local level, or online. Also, as noted above, some manufacturers sell directly to end users. With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous offerings, including those from Henry Schein, Inc. and Carestream Dental.

In the U.S. and Canadian animal health supply market, our primary competitors are AmerisourceBergen/MWI Animal Health and Covetrus, Inc. We also compete against a number of regional and local animal health distributors, some manufacturers that sell direct to end users and several alternative channel market providers that sell through digital platforms to production animal operators, animal health product retailers and veterinarians. Additionally, major U.S. online e-commerce retailers such as Amazon and Chewy.com are becoming licensed as veterinary mail order pharmacies to offer pharmacy products directly to consumers in all 50 U.S. states. In the animal health practice management market, our primary competitors are IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. and Covetrus, Inc. We face significant competition in the animal health supply market in the U.K., where we compete on the basis of price and customer service with several large competitors, including Covetrus, Inc. and AmerisourceBergen. We also compete directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products or services directly to the customer. 

Successful distributors are increasingly providing value-added services in addition to the products they have traditionally provided. We believe that to remain competitive we must continue to add value to the distribution channel, while removing unnecessary costs associated with product movement. Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in competitive harm. Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.

Competitive Strengths

We have more than 140 years of experience in distributing products resulting in strong awareness of the Patterson brand. Although further information regarding these competitive strengths is set forth below in the discussion of our two strategic business units, our competitive strengths include:

•Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices. We sell approximately 200,000 SKUs to our customers, including many proprietary branded products. We believe that our proprietary branded products and our competitive pricing strategy have generated a loyal customer base that is confident in our brands. Our product offerings include consumables, equipment, software and various technologies. Our value-added services include practice management software, office design, equipment installation and maintenance, and financing.

6
•Focus on customer relationships and exceptional customer service. Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal visits by field sales representatives, interaction via phone with sales representatives, web-based activities including e-commerce and frequent direct marketing, emphasizing our broad product lines, competitive prices and ease of order placement. We focus on providing our customers with exceptional order fulfillment and a streamlined ordering process.

•Cost-effective purchasing and efficient distribution. We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitive-pricing provider of dental and animal health products. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels to satisfy customer demand for prompt and complete order fulfillment through our distribution of products from strategically located fulfillment centers.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to continue to expand as a leading value-added distributor of dental and animal health products and services. To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:

•Emphasizing our differentiated, value-added, full-service capabilities. We are positioned to meet virtually all of the needs of dental practitioners, veterinarians, production animal operators and animal health product retailers by providing a broad range of consumable supplies, technology, equipment and software and value-added services. We believe our knowledgeable sales representatives can create customer intimacy and loyalty by providing an informational, consultative approach to our customers, linking them to the industries we serve. Our value-added strategy is further supported by our equipment specialists who offer consultation on design, equipment requirements and financing, our service technicians who perform equipment installation, maintenance and repair services, our business development professionals who provide business tools and educational programs to our customers, and our technology advisors who provide guidance on integrating technology solutions.

•Using technology to enhance customer service. As part of our commitment to providing superior customer service, we offer our customers easy order placement. Although we offer computerized order entry systems that we believe help establish relationships with new customers and increase loyalty among existing customers, predominant platforms for ordering today include www.pattersondental.com, www.pattersonvet.com and www.animalhealthinternational.com. The use of these methods of ordering enables our sales representatives to spend more time with existing and prospective customers. Our Internet environment includes order entry, customer support for digital and our proprietary products, customer-loyalty program reports and services, and access to articles and manufacturers’ product information. We also provide real-time customer and sales information to our sales force, managers and vendors via the Internet. In addition, the Patterson Technology Center (“PTC”) differentiates Patterson from our competition by providing deep and thorough expertise in practice management software and other advanced equipment and technology clinical solutions. In addition to trouble-shooting through the PTC’s support center, customers can access various service capabilities offered by the PTC, including electronic claims and statement processing and system back-up capabilities.

•Continuing to improve operating efficiencies. We continue to implement programs designed to improve our operating efficiencies and allow for continued sales growth. This strategy includes our continuing investment in management information systems and consolidation and leveraging of fulfillment centers and sales branches between our operating segments. In addition, we have established shared sales branch offices in several locations.

•Growing through internal expansion and acquisitions. We intend to continue to grow by hiring established sales representatives, hiring and training skilled sales professionals, opening additional locations as needed, and acquiring other companies in order to enter new, or more deeply penetrate existing, markets, gain access to additional product lines, and expand our customer base. We believe both of our operating segments are well positioned to take advantage of expected continued consolidation in our markets. 

Dental Segment - Products, Services and Sources of Supply

Patterson Dental, one of the two largest distributors of dental products in North America, has operations in the U.S. and Canada. As a full-service, value-added supplier to over 100,000 dental practices, dental laboratories, educational institutions, and community health centers, Patterson Dental provides consumable products (including infection control, restorative materials, and instruments); basic and advanced technology and dental equipment; and 

7
innovative practice optimization solutions, including practice management software, e-commerce, revenue cycle management, patient engagement solutions, and clinical and patient education. Patterson Dental sells approximately 100,000 SKUs, of which approximately 3,500 are private-label products sold under the Patterson brand. Patterson Dental also offers customers a range of related services including software and design services, maintenance and repair, and equipment financing. Net sales and operating income were $2.5 billion and $180 million in fiscal 2022, respectively.

The following table sets forth the percentage of total sales by the principal categories of products and services offered to our dental segment customers: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Patterson Dental obtains products from hundreds of vendors, most of which are non-exclusive. While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products we sell, the concentration of business with key suppliers is considerable, as consolidation has increased among manufacturers. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, Patterson Dental's top ten supply vendors accounted for approximately 56%, 57% and 63% of the total cost of sales, respectively. The top vendor accounted for 24%, 25% and 22% of the total cost of sales in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Animal Health Segment - Products, Services and Sources of Supply

Patterson Animal Health is a leading distributor of animal health products in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. We sell approximately 100,000 SKUs sourced from over 2,000 manufacturers to over 50,000 customers in the highly fragmented animal health supply market. Products we distribute include pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, prescription and non-prescription diets, nutritionals, consumable supplies, equipment and software. We offer a private label portfolio of products to veterinarians, producers, and retailers through our Aspen, First Companion and Patterson Veterinary brands. We also provide a range of value-added services to our customers. Within our companion animal supply market, our principal customers are companion-pet and equine veterinarians, veterinary clinics, public and private institutions, and shelters. In our production animal supply market, our principal customers are large animal veterinarians, production animal operators and animal health product retailers. Consumer demand for alternative means of sourcing product through digital platforms is an evolving dynamic in our industry. We provide digital home delivery solutions to allow us to evolve with the market. Net sales and operating income were $4.0 billion and $114 million in fiscal 2022, respectively.

The following table sets forth the percentage of total sales by the principal categories of products and services offered to our animal health segment customers:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Patterson Animal Health obtains products from over 2,000 vendors globally. While Patterson Animal Health makes purchases from many vendors and there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of products, the concentration of business with key vendors is considerable, as consolidation has increased among manufacturers. In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, Patterson Animal Health’s top 10 manufacturers comprised approximately 66%, 70% and 70% of the total cost of sales, respectively, and the single largest supplier comprised approximately 23% in 2022 and 20% of the total cost of sales in 2021 and 2020.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

During fiscal 2022, we sold products or services to over 100,000 customers who made one or more purchases during the year. Our customers include dentists, laboratories, institutions, other healthcare professionals, veterinarians, other animal health professionals, production animal operators and animal health product retailers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of sales during fiscal 2022, and we are not dependent on any single customer or geographic group of customers. 

We have offices throughout the U.S. and Canada so that we can provide a presence in the market and decision-making near the customer. Patterson Animal Health also has a central office in the U.K. Our offices, or sales branches, are staffed with a complete complement of our capabilities, including sales, customer service and technical service personnel, as well as a local manager who has decision-making authority with regard to customer-related transactions and issues.

A primary component of our value-added approach is our professional sales and support organization. Due to the highly-fragmented nature of the markets we serve, we believe that our unique combination of field-based and call-center sales and support teams is critical to reaching potential customers and providing a differentiated customer experience. Our sales representatives play an indispensable and critical role in managing a practice’s supply chain and in introducing new products and technologies.

In the U.S. and Canada, customer service representatives in call centers work in tandem with our sales representatives, providing a dual coverage approach for individual customers. In addition to processing orders, customer service representatives are responsible for assisting customers with ordering, informing customers of monthly promotions, and responding to general inquiries. In the U.K., our customer service team is primarily responsible for handling customer inquiries and resolving issues.

To assist our customers with their purchasing decisions, we provide a multi-touchpoint shopping experience. From print to digital, this seamless experience is inclusive of products and services information. Patterson offers online and in-print showcases of our expansive merchandise and equipment offerings, including digital imaging and computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing ("CAD/CAM") technologies, hand-held and similar instruments, sundries, office design, e-services, repair and support assistance, as well as financial services. We also promote select products and services through publications, including On Target and Advantage in the U.S. and Patterson Post in Canada in our Dental segment, and Insight in the U.S. and The Cube in the U.K. in our Animal Health segment. Additional direct marketing tools that we utilize include customer loyalty programs, social media, and participation in trade shows.

We believe that responsive delivery of quality supplies and equipment is key to customer satisfaction. We ship consumable supplies from our strategically located fulfillment centers in the U.S. and Canada. In the U.K., orders are accepted in a centralized fulfillment center and shipped nationwide to one of our depots located throughout the country at which pre-packed orders are sorted by route for delivery to customers. Orders for consumable supplies can be placed through our sales representatives, customer service representatives or electronically 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Rapid and accurate order fulfillment is another principal component of our value-added approach. 

In order to assure the availability of our broad product lines for prompt delivery to customers, we must maintain sufficient inventories at our fulfillment centers. Purchasing of consumables and standard equipment is centralized, and our purchasing department uses a real-time perpetual inventory system to manage inventory levels. Our inventory consists mostly of consumable supply items and pharmaceutical products. 

Geographic Information

For information on revenues and long-lived assets of our segments by geographic area, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results

Our business in general is not seasonal; however, there are some products that typically sell more often during the winter or summer season. In any given month, unusual weather patterns (e.g., unusually hot or cold weather) could impact the sales volumes of these products, either positively or negatively. In addition, we experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, 

9
which could cause our stock price to decline. Quarterly results may be materially adversely affected by a variety of factors, including:

•timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;

•timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;

•timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;

•changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;

•supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;

•changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;

•costs of developing new applications and services;

•our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;

•uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;

•regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;

•loss of sales representatives;

•costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;

•costs associated with our self-insured insurance programs;

•general market and economic conditions, as discussed in Item 1A: Risk Factors, including pandemic, macro-economic conditions, increased fuel and energy costs, consumer confidence, as well as conditions specific to the supply and distribution industry and related industries;

•our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;

•difficulties of manufacturers in developing and manufacturing products;

•product demand and availability, or product recalls by manufacturers;

•exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;

•increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;

•fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;

•goodwill impairment;

•changes in interest rates;

•restructuring costs;

•the adoption or repeal of legislation;

•changes in accounting principles; and

•litigation or regulatory judgments, fines, forfeitures, penalties, equitable remedies, expenses or settlements.

Governmental Regulation

We strive to be compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial compliance. However, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future, as certain laws, regulations and guidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply, as well as future changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including political changes. President Biden’s administration (the “Biden Administration”) has indicated that it will be more aggressive in its pursuit of alleged violations of law, and it has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency guidance to pursue potential violations, as well as that it was more prepared to pursue individuals for corporate law violations, including an aggressive approach to anti-corruption activities. Changes to applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, as well as related administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to update or revise our operations, services, marketing practices, and compliance programs and controls, and may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial risks to us, or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards

Our dental and animal health supply businesses involve the distribution, importation, exportation, marketing and sale of, and third party payment for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard, we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of 

10
pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Among the U.S. federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDC Act”), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as laws regulating the billing of and reimbursement from government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and from commercial payers. We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.

The FDC Act, the Controlled Substances Act, their implementing regulations, and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion, sampling, pricing and reimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or recalling, reporting, and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state. Furthermore, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”

The federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements. Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), is being phased in over a period of 10 years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system by November 27, 2023, that will identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the U.S. The law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and continues to be implemented. The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt certain state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements.

The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities. The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs. The DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information. According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area. Current state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (“UDI”) system. The UDI rule phased in the implementation of the UDI regulations, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices. Most compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with a final set of requirements for low-risk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which will complete the phase in. However, in May 2021, the FDA issued an enforcement policy stating that it does not intend to object to the use of legacy identification numbers on device labels and packages for finished devices manufactured and labeled prior to September 24, 2023. The UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices (including, but not limited to, certain software that qualifies as a medical device under FDA rules), and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs. The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database. The UDI regulations and subsequent FDA guidance regarding the UDI requirements provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions. For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping and complaint files). Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label, and include certain of our businesses.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) permitting us to handle controlled substances. We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in 

11
recent times. We are subject to inspection by the DEA. There have also been increasing efforts by various levels of government globally to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or misbranded pharmaceuticals into the distribution system.

Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment. In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue. We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our fulfillment centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers. Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to delay product release, sale or distribution, or institute voluntary recalls of, or other corrective action with respect to, products we sell, each of which could result in regulatory and enforcement actions, financial losses and potential reputational harm. Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation, which may affect our interactions with customers, including the design and functionality of the products we distribute.

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions. In addition, certain of our businesses must operate in compliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and record keeping requirements in order to substantiate claims for payment under federal, state and commercial healthcare reimbursement programs.

Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.

As disclosed in our prior periodic reports, our subsidiary Animal Health International was the subject of an investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which resulted in Animal Health International pleading guilty to a strict-liability misdemeanor offense in connection with its failure to comply with federal law relating to the sales of prescription animal health products, and a total criminal fine and forfeiture of $52.8 million. In addition, Animal Health International and Patterson entered into a non-prosecution agreement for other non-compliant licensing, dispensing, distribution and related sales processes disclosed during the investigation and committed to undertake additional compliance program enhancements and provide compliance certifications through fiscal 2023. This matter may continue to divert management's attention and cause us to suffer reputational harm. We also may be subject to other fines or penalties, equitable remedies (including but not limited to the suspension, revocation or non-renewal of licenses) and litigation. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Antitrust and Consumer Protection

The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, as well as consumer protection laws that seek to protect consumers from improper business practices. At the U.S. federal level, the Federal Trade Commission oversees enforcement of these types of laws, and states have similar government agencies. Violations of antitrust or consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs also may bring, and have brought, civil lawsuits against us in the U.S. for alleged antitrust violations, including claims for treble damages. The Biden Administration has indicated increased antitrust enforcement and has been more aggressive in enforcement actions.

Health Care Fraud

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to 

12
federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Several states apply their false claims and anti-kickback laws to all payers, including goods and services paid for directly by consumers. Certain additional state and federal laws, such as the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician (or family member) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services (for example, durable medical equipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies. Violations of anti-kickback laws or the Stark Law may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims Act.

The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators,” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the U.S. (and, if applicable, particular states) under applicable false claim laws. Under the federal False Claims Act, relators can be entitled to receive up to 30% of the total recoveries. Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act, as well as potential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, criminal penalties, or imposition of a corporate compliance monitor which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties, as well as other fraud and abuse laws. With respect to measures of this type, the U.S. government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. We are also subject to certain U.S. and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years. While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, or failure to comply with applicable law, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Affordable Care Act and Other Insurance Reform

The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (as amended, the “ACA”) increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. The ACA also materially expanded the number of individuals in the U.S. with health insurance. The ACA has faced frequent legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate and Congressional action seeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. In 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its individual mandate provision requiring that people buy health insurance or else face a penalty, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision. In addition, one of the major political parties in the U.S. remains committed to seeking the ACA's legislative repeal, but legislative efforts to do so have previously failed to pass both chambers of Congress. Under President Trump's administration, a number of administrative actions were taken to materially weaken the ACA, including, without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating "premium support" for insurers providing policies under the ACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017 (the "Tax Act"), which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add back provisions and deductions, also effectively repealed the ACA's individual mandate by zeroing out the penalty for non-compliance. In the most recent ACA litigation, the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to the District Court for the Northern District of Texas for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual mandate. The Fifth Circuit's decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17, 2021. Without reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the ACA. Any outcomes of future cases that change the 

13
ACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or executive orders that do the same, could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry. For instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits, which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA. These changes are time-limited, with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022. The continued uncertain status of the ACA affects our ability to plan.

An ACA provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program (the “Sunshine Act”), has imposed reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by covered recipients in the reporting entity. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist, teaching hospital and non-practitioner identities.

The Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be unclear. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. In the U.S., government actions to seek to increase health-related price transparency may also affect our business. Our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.

In addition, recently there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President, executive branch agencies and various states, including that several related bills have been introduced at the federal level. Such legislation, if enacted, could have the potential to impose additional costs on our business.

As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the U.S. is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us. 

Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records

The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings. The 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), signed into law in December 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from FDA regulation, including clinical decision support software that meets certain criteria. In September 2019, the FDA issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products, which incorporated applicable Cures Act standards, including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the FDA as medical devices, and continues to issue new guidance in this area. Certain of our software and related products support practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.

In addition, certain of our practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns, and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) that becomes effective on January 1, 2023. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protections are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. Our businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of control claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area 

14
could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products to reflect these legal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Certain of our electronic practice management products must meet these requirements. Failure to abide by these and other electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.

Also, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted the pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in Europe, including individuals who are our customers, suppliers, and employees. The GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors, and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies that offer goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe (“Data Subjects”) or monitor their behavior (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues, and Data Subjects may seek damages. Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters such as employee personal data. With respect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data, breach notifications within 72 hours, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the storage, use or other processing of the personal data. The GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating notably to information, access, modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.

In the U.S., the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became effective in January 2020. The CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information of California residents. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. Regulations were released in August 2020, there remains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation, any of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business. Furthermore, California voters approved the CPRA in November 2020, which will amend and expand the CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information, and creating a new state agency to enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected by business on or after January 1, 2022.

Other states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance. Virginia and Colorado were both successful in passing privacy legislation in 2021, becoming effective on January 1, 2023 and July 1, 2023, respectively. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR, CCPA and CPRA requirements, our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as dentists, use to store and manage patient dental records. These customers, and we, are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records, and our products may also be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy or security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.

Various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes. Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, and comply with evolving legal 

15
requirements, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking. Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

E-Commerce

Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition. The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.

Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

International Transactions

U.S. and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the U.S.

There can be no assurance that laws and regulations that impact our business or laws and regulations as they apply to our customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business. As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the U.S. is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Proprietary Rights

We hold trademarks relating to the “Patterson®” name and logo, as well as certain other trademarks. Our U.S. trademark registrations have 10-year terms, and may be renewed for additional 10-year terms. We intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable.

Human Capital

People are the most important part of Patterson. Our employees are the reason we can confidently say we offer Trusted Expertise, Unrivaled Support to our customers every day. 

As of April 30, 2022, we had approximately 7,700 full-time employees, of which approximately 6,300 were employed in the U.S.

16
Our culture is driven by our purpose, vision, and values:

As a people-first organization, the overall well-being of our team is important to us. Patterson’s total reward philosophy is to provide market competitive pay and a range of benefit choices designed to meet our employees’ needs, reward for individual and business performance, and drive shareholder value. We support our employees’ health with medical, dental and vision plans, wellness programs to encourage healthy lifestyles and parental leave for new mothers, fathers and domestic partners. Patterson supports employees’ financial well-being with matching 401K contributions, company-paid short-term disability insurance, and educational offerings throughout the year. 

Our diverse talent acquisition programming includes a focus and commitment to hiring military personnel (both current and inactive). We recognize that the skills developed in the military are highly valuable and beneficial to Patterson, which is why we partner with more than 16 military organizations to find this top talent. We also partner with Minnesota organizations that introduce high school students from underserved communities into the workplace with internships in IT and other corporate functions, and we have a robust college internship program to establish a pipeline of future talent and give students real-world experience. 

To support the progression and career development of our employees, we offer multiple training and development opportunities including on-demand courses, facilitator-led programs, mentoring relationships, tuition reimbursement and leadership development programs. We have implemented targeted development programs for senior leadership as well as emerging leaders in the organization. In addition, Patterson’s Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) team promotes employee safety and environmental awareness through foundational systems and activities, including safety training courses.

We are passionate about taking action to support the communities in which we serve. We provide opportunities for and encourage employees to support local charitable organizations through volunteerism (including volunteer time off), team building, and donation and matching programs. In addition, the Patterson Foundation has donated millions of dollars to dental and animal health nonprofit organizations in order to increase access to oral health care and increase the availability of assistance dogs to veterans, first responders and individuals with disabilities. Quarterly grants are awarded with a preference to organizations where our employees volunteer and those our employees value in their communities.

We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce makes our company stronger, and we encourage our teams to bring their authentic selves to Patterson every day. Our UNITES team is a volunteer-led initiative that has driven various diversity and inclusion efforts, including the launch of employee-led affinity groups for our LGBTQA and under-represented employee populations. Acting on the recommendation of the affinity groups, Patterson will add Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a company-paid holiday in 2023 in recognition of this important day to honor the 

17
sacrifices he made for racial equality. Patterson has several programs in place to support the advancement of women in the workplace, both internally and in the industries we serve. Patterson has launched an enterprise-wide Inclusive Leader program that all leaders will participate in by the end of 2023. As of April 30, 2022, 42.0% of our U.S. workforce and 38.9% of our management was female. In addition, as of that date, 23.8% of our U.S. workforce and 16.1% of our management was ethnically diverse. 

To protect our employees and reduce the spread of COVID-19 in our communities during the pandemic, we implemented numerous guidelines and safety protocols. Every team member who could work remotely did so, and we implemented tools and resources to support our team members’ health and financial well-being by providing paid time off for those who were quarantined or those who needed to support distance learning for school-age children. During the pandemic, we expanded our medical plan to cover COVID-related health care and extended paid time off to provide additional time for recovery and quarantine, as needed. We also continued to offer services through our Employee Assistance Program and introduced an online tutoring program to assist parents with students who were impacted by COVID.
