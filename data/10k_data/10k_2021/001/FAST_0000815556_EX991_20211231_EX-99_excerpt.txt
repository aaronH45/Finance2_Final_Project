Journey TABLE OF CONTENTS Letters to Shareholders and Employees 1-3 10-Year Selected Financial Data and Financial Highlights 4-5 Stock and Financial Data 6 Stock Performance Highlights 7 A Focus on Productive Growth 8 A For more than 50 years, Fastenal has been on a journey to impact an ever-greater span of the supply chain for industrial and construction supplies and, in turn, provide ever-greater value to our customers. As illustrated in the statistics below, today that means managing our customers’ inventory locally so they can step away from those burdens. It means providing solutions that help them reduce their total cost of ownership and operate more productively. Above all, it means ensuring a resilient and efficient supply chain – from the source, to the last mile, to the point of use – so they can keep their businesses moving full speed ahead in a volatile world.  

SHAREHOLDER OF FASTENAL Thank you for being a Similar to prior years, we hope you find this annual report useful in understanding our business, our future, and most importantly, the “something special” that is the culture of the Blue Team. One year ago, we felt normalcy might be returning. New vaccines were arriving to help societies battle the pandemic, and the medical community was learning new methods to treat those afflicted with the virus. Unfortunately, things are rarely so simple. Societies are often underserved by those asked to lead and inform. We’re also subject to our own fears and biases, especially in times of stress. A virus created a generational challenge. At times, humanity has made it worse. Fortunately, we continue to find success as an organization, albeit not always in ways we expect. Holden Lewis, our chief financial officer, made an interesting comment a few months ago in a conversation with an investor. We were discussing the lower level of Onsite and FMI Technology signings during the pandemic period. (See lower right for descriptions of these and the other bolded terms on this page.) When asked about the cause, he explained customers sought our help in different ways during the last two years. In 2020, they asked for help keeping their employees and customers safe – this meant help with safety products. The Blue Team used our deep product knowledge, our extensive quality systems, and our vast supplier network to help customers find high-quality safety products. In 2021, supply chains were shattered, and the customer ask expanded to include more types of products. Our strength is finding solutions to these types of supply chain problems. During this period, we believe our opportunities fundamentally improved in two ways. First, we sold to a wider range of customers, adding new healthcare and government customers. This expanded marketplace is now familiar with the value of the Fastenal supply chain. Second, at the start of the pandemic, we closed the front doors to our local branches. (For background, we deliver most of our sales to customer facilities, so most of our product goes out the back door, so to speak.) We closed the front door to protect our employees and our customers. With the front door closed, and with customers quickly modifying their buying habits, we tweaked our existing branch format to create the Customer Service Branch (or CSB). We also developed a new branch format, the Customer Fulfillment Center (or CFC). These modified branch formats dovetail quite nicely with the needs of the marketplace, with our Onsite network, and with our distribution network. Our in-market servicing locations (CSBs, CFCs, and Onsite locations) are all complemented by our expanding Digital Footprint. We believe in transparency. Similar to last year, we felt it would be helpful to share a section from the Blue Team Report (the new name for our annual report to employees). The next two pages include the index and lead-in letter from the current report. As you can see from the index, there are a lot of great things going on at Fastenal. Similar to last year, the final item noted is an article by our founder, Bob Kierlin. Not surprising, Bob continues to actively support the Blue Team, even in retirement. We will always approach things in a simple way at Fastenal. Believe in people. Always strive to pursue a common goal: Growth Through Customer Service. And enhance our ability to serve by finding great people, asking them to join, and then giving them a reason to stay. Good luck in 2022, and thank you for your belief in the Blue Team at Fastenal. Go Blue! DANIEL L. FLORNESS President and Chief Executive Officer ONSITE A Fastenal servicing location dedicated to, and usually situated within, a customer facility. FMI TECHNOLOGY A suite of solutions to illuminate and efficiently manage customers’ planned product needs. Includes FASTStock (manual bin stock service enhanced with mobility technology), FASTBin (bin devices with embedded technology for remote inventory monitoring), and FASTVend (specialized devices providing access controls and asset and usage tracking, in addition to remote inventory monitoring). CSB Similar to our legacy branch model, there’s still a front room where walk-in customers (primarily contractors) can shop for products. The difference: a more targeted inventory profile and an industrial look and feel. CFC These branches function like “mini distribution centers,” with limited hours for will-call pickup, dense industrial shelving, and a lean market-based inventory strategy to support local supply chain needs. DIGITAL FOOTPRINT A combination of our sales through FMI Technology (see adjacent definition) plus that portion of our eCommerce sales that do not represent billings of FMI services. DEFINITIONS 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 1  

For the runners in the crowd, you will get where I’m going with this line of thought. For the rest of you, let me share some things I’ve learned from a little internet research. (Hopefully the following information is accurate; you know, I read it on the internet, so it must be true.) The human body can store a finite amount of glycogen, and these reserves typically run out after about 18 to 20 miles of running. At this point, your ability to take in carbohydrates before (and during) the race, your ability to stay hydrated during the race, your body’s ability to convert fat and protein to energy (a very inefficient process), and your attitude dictate what happens over the last six to eight miles. Fortunately for most of us, this is not something we regularly encounter; however, we all know the feeling of pushing beyond what we thought was possible. After two years of the pandemic, we are approaching the 18 to 20 mile mark. And yes, we can complete this marathon. Last year, my letter centered on five (non- virus) storylines that stood out for 2020. These qualities shone through during the toughest days of the pandemic, and they bear repeating as we push toward the finish line. 1. We run faster (and learn faster) than anyone else. 2. We don’t fracture; we rally to support each other. 3. When we point a finger, it’s usually at ourselves. 4. We have the skill set to help others, and the confidence to stay focused. 5. We always build for the future. One year ago, we had multiple vaccines in the final stages of approval (this comment applies to the planet, not just one or several societies), and we were in the starting days of vaccine deployment across the globe. The world breathed a sigh of relief … yet twelve months later, our headlines are still dominated by the pandemic. Why? It might be an outgrowth of an endless 24/7 media cycle, which often serves not to inform but rather to inflame the anxieties of society; and perhaps it centers on four words: trust, arrogance, inclusion, and blame. These concepts often determine success or failure when tackling a problem, and they take on special meaning in the context of the Blue Team. When thinking of Trust within the Blue Team, the concept to emerge is a belief in everyone’s ability to put self and others in balance and to discover the best solution to a problem. When thinking of Arrogance within the Blue Team, the concept to emerge is its opposite: humility. We are self-aware enough to appreciate we are all “full of it” periodically; therefore, we listen to and share ideas with each other to discover the best solution to a problem. When thinking of Inclusion within the Blue Team, the concept to emerge is a belief in people. We believe in the intentions of others, we believe in each other, and we believe having a variety of different perspectives helps us discover the best solution to a problem. When thinking of Blame within the Blue Team, what emerges is a two-part question: Why does it matter, and how does it help? Instead of pointing fingers, we take steps to discover the best solution to the problem, then act accordingly. Sorry for the serious nature of this year’s letter. Perhaps we are all impacted by the lack of human contact in the last two years.

Okay, that’s probably not a surprise to anyone; however, a marathon seems like a good metaphor for what we’re all living through right now. Doesn’t it sometimes feel like we’re hitting a wall, energy is low, and every new step (or new day) is a repeating and energy-draining event? THIS YEAR’S ARTICLES & TOPICS 2  

We are in this together – the Blue Team – and I personally miss the human side, the camaraderie of coming together. For a step on the lighter side, let’s get back to the marathon and the next leg (yes, pun intended) of the run. During the last two years, we have maintained our energy and our hydration by (1) learning new things, (2) creating safer work environments, (3) expanding how we go to market, and (4) modifying how we operate. All of these steps were taken to evolve how the Blue Team serves each other and the needs of the market tomorrow. Our expanding Digital Footprint is a great example. For background, our Digital Footprint is how we illuminate the supply chain for our customers and bring greater efficiency in the process. It includes eCommerce (transacting electronically using web verticals, eProcurement, etc.) and FMI Technology (Fastenal Managed Inventory): FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend. To put this into context, we believe 85% of our customers’ spend could eventually become part of our Digital Footprint. Two years ago, it was about 36% of sales. (This is an estimate; the reporting from our pre-mobility scanning technology wasn’t as crisp as what we’re able to capture today through our FASTStock solution.) Twelve months ago, our Digital Footprint had expanded to about 37% of sales, and today it is 46%. The momentum with our Digital Footprint is strong, and the marketplace is very receptive to the change. In the first half of 2022, it should break 50%, and we expect it to exceed 60% by the end of the year. Achieving this potential is all about our willingness and attitude to drive the change. As you can appreciate, a large Digital Footprint provides incredible amounts of usage information – what is being used, where it’s being used, when it’s being used, and who’s using it. This knowledge allows us to be more strategic about planning our customers’ supply chains, about staging our supply chain assets (inventory and equipment), about where we pick and consolidate a customer’s order (think LIFTs, Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals), about providing insight to our suppliers about expected needs, and about making suggested improvements. This knowledge also allows us to help make every customer’s supply chain more resilient and effective, and allows us to grow faster and serve more customers. Everyone wins in this scenario (well, everyone but our competitors). Growth creates opportunities, and these opportunities are filled through internal promotions because we learn and build our skill sets every day. Our Fastenal School of Business exists to serve you – please continue to prepare yourself in 2022. As in prior years, we celebrated some new milestones in 2021. Here’s a partial list: 1. We were named one of the safest companies by EHS Today magazine. 2. The Blue Team in Mexico and Singapore celebrated 20 years in business. 3. Our FMI Technology program hit new heights. FASTStock exceeded $550 million in annual sales, FASTBin broke $5 million in monthly sales in September, and FASTVend surpassed one billion vends in December. 4. Our company sales eclipsed $6 billion for the first time. 5. Our market capitalization (total shares outstanding x price per share) broke $30 billion in April. Within the Blue Team, I’m a more seasoned member. (That’s a nice way to say I’m old – 58.) I remember watching humans land and walk on the moon. I remember my grandmother talking about humans learning to fly during her lifetime. I witnessed space travel as it transitioned from fiction to possible to routine, and I also remember learning about Earth from the perspective of space. This started with verbal descriptions and books, then moved to visuals, first on my family’s old black and white television, later in full-color video. Bottom line, here is this beautiful blue planet – yep, it’s blue – and it serves as an incredible home for all of us. Please take care of each other in 2022, and please continue to take care of this beautiful planet. If you see ways for us to conserve resources, to operate more efficiently, or to bring ideas to the market, please speak up – your ideas and insights are valued. In the months to come, you will hear more about two sets of initials: ESG (environmental, social, and governance) and DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion). These terms have become more common in recent years; however, the underlying concepts aren’t new to the Blue Team. That said, aligning them with our core values will feel forced as long as they’re associated with detached and cold terminology. During 2022, we will work to transition to more meaningful and energizing language – words we can all relate to within Fastenal. Some early suggestions have been to brand ESG as simply Being Blue and to brand DEI as A Reason to Stay. Again, these are just initial thoughts. We will be engaging with the Blue Team to find the best branding. This may include a survey or two to solicit feedback and ideas. Let me close by saying thank you. Thank you for preparing yourself to get through the wall our global society is going to keep hitting until we transition from a pandemic to an endemic. This will happen; if for no other reason, because humanity needs it to happen. We will learn to live and succeed in the new normal. At Fastenal, we will do it in part by Being Blue and by giving everyone A Reason to Stay. Good luck in 2022, DAN FLORNESS President & Chief Executive OfficerMarathon 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 3

The information below provides details on how we define and calculate these measures, which are derived from GAAP financial measures contained in our financial statements. As of January 21, 2022, there were approximately 1,000 record holders of our common stock, which includes nominees or broker dealers holding stock on behalf of an estimated 411,000 beneficial owners. In 2021 and 2020, we paid dividends per share totaling $1.12 and $1.40, respectively. On January 18, 2022, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.31 per share to be paid on March 2, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 2, 2022. Our board of directors intends to continue paying quarterly dividends; however, any future determination as to payment of dividends will depend upon the financial condition and results of operations of the company and such other factors as are deemed relevant by the board of directors. In 2021, we did not purchase any shares of our common stock. In 2020, we purchased 1,600,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $32.54 per share.

HISTORICAL STOCK PERFORMANCE INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING (IPO) On August 20, 1987 (date of our initial public offering), 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $9,000. Approximately 34 years later, on December 31, 2021, those 1,000 shares, having split eight times, had become 192,000 shares worth $12,299,520, for a gain of approximately 23.7% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $1,705,824 in dividends since August 20, 1987, for a total gain of approximately 24.1% compounded annually. TEN YEARS On December 31, 2011, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $43,620. Ten years later, on December 31, 2021, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $128,120, for a gain of approximately 11.4% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $14,960 in dividends since December 2011, for a total gain of approximately 12.6% compounded annually. FIVE YEARS On December 31, 2016, 1,000 shares of our stock sold for $46,980. Five years later, on December 31, 2021, those 1,000 shares, having split once, were 2,000 shares worth $128,120, for a gain of approximately 22.2% compounded annually. In addition, the holder of these shares would have received $9,600 in dividends since December 2016, for a total gain of approximately 24.0% compounded annually. DIVIDENDS We have paid dividends in every year since 1991, and quarterly dividends since 2011. In addition, Fastenal paid a special one-time dividend during December 2020, 2012, and 2008. A SIMPLE PHILOSOPHY Since going public in 1987, we have maintained a consistent focus on avoiding, if feasible, the potentially dilutive impact of our activities on our shareholders. To this end, we have grown our organization principally with internal cash flow, have supported the Fastenal Company and Subsidiaries 401(k) and Employee Stock Ownership Plan with stock purchased in the open market, and, since creating a stock option program in 2003, have periodically purchased common stock in the open market to, among other things, offset the potential impact of our stock option grants. We have purchased approximately 49.4 million shares since 2003 and have granted our employees options to purchase approximately 30.7 million shares. (Note: These amounts have been adjusted to reflect the impact of stock splits.) This has allowed us to balance internal investment with cash returns to shareholders. For example, in the last five years we have enjoyed total sales of $26,348 million and total pre-tax earnings of $5,244 million. During this same time period, we spent approximately $4,925 million to compensate a group of great employees, we supported our customers’ needs by adding approximately $931 million in operational working capital assets (accounts receivable, net, plus inventory) and by spending approximately $825 million in net capital expenditures (purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds of sales), and we returned $2,994 million to our shareholders. The latter was principally through dividends (approximately $2,757 million), with the remainder through share purchases. A final point worth noting: We are an important element of the tax base in the many communities in which we operate. During the last five years, we have incurred approximately $1,339 million in income taxes, or approximately 25.5% of the pre-tax earnings noted above, and incurred or remitted approximately $1,275 million in employment taxes, $62 million in property taxes, $874 million in sales, use, and value-added taxes, and $5 million in other miscellaneous business-related taxes. This adds up to a total of approximately $3.6 billion in taxes funded in our communities. 1,000 shares ($9,000) invested on August 20, 1987 Value on December 31, 2021: $12,299,520 Stock Split STOCK PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS (1), (2) 2021 ANNUAL REPORT 7  

DIGITAL FOOTPRINT We’ve accelerated the development and deployment of our FMI Technology (Fastenal Managed Inventory) offering: FASTStock, FASTBin, and FASTVend. As a result, sales through FMI Technology and traditional eCommerce, collectively our “Digital Footprint,” have grown from an estimated 37.2% of company sales in 4Q20 to 46.4% of company sales in 4Q21. These technologies reduce cost and risk for customers by illuminating their inventory positions and usage activity. They also drive productivity for Fastenal by making product replenishment more proactive and efficient. As we look ahead, we believe our Digital Footprint will expand to approximately 85% of sales when we achieve $10 billion in annual revenue. LIFT Our deployment of Local Inventory Fulfillment Terminals (LIFTs) shifts responsibility for the replenishment of FMI devices from our in-market locations to regional micro-hubs. This increases our selling energy, and ultimately labor productivity, by increasing the proportion of time our sales personnel spend selling vs. servicing. We also enjoy a boost to our asset efficiency by consolidating FMI-related inventory into fewer locations. When we achieve $10 billion in annual sales, we believe our FMI program will generate $6.5 billion in revenue and 40% of those FMI sales will be serviced by LIFTs. BRANCHES We’re migrating U.S. branches from our traditional Customer Service Project (CSP) stocking model to our Customer Fulfillment Center (CFC) and Customer Service Branch (CSB) models. With these models, each location’s inventory is customized based on sales and market data. This includes removing lightly-sold and walk-in-oriented SKUs, improving asset efficiency. CFC locations (66.8% of our total U.S. branches at year-end 2021) are designed to reduce the amount of time branch personnel spend on smaller, retail-oriented customers so they can spend more time on larger local, regional, and national accounts, accelerating market share gains and improving labor productivity. We also anticipate this structure will enhance our occupancy leverage.

Against this backdrop, in 2021 the Blue Team did an outstanding job to produce 6.4% annual net sales growth. Over the same period, our pre-tax profit grew 6.6% and our margin expanded. We believe this productive growth is a product of investments we’ve made over the last two years in our technology, our supply chain, and our go-to-market strategy.
