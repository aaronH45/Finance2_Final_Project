Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and "Forward-Looking Statements" included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Fiscal Year

We report our results based on a "52-53 week" year ending on the last Friday of December. Fiscal 2021 consisted of 53 weeks and fiscal 2020 and 2019 each consisted of 52 weeks. 

Overview

We are a global business consisting of multiple wholly owned subsidiaries that develop, manufacture, market and distribute specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies. Areas of focus include autoimmune and rare diseases in specialty areas like neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, pulmonology, ophthalmology and oncology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies; analgesics; cultured skin substitutes and gastrointestinal products.

We operate our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below:

•Specialty Brands includes innovative specialty pharmaceutical brands; and

•Specialty Generics includes niche specialty generic drugs and API(s).

For further information on our business and products, refer to Item 1. Business included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Significant Events

Voluntary Filing Under Chapter 11 and Going Concern

Chapter 11 Proceedings

On the Petition Date, we voluntarily initiated the Chapter 11 Cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court to modify our capital structure, including restructuring portions of our debt, and resolve otherwise unmanageable potential legal 

52

liabilities. We are continuing to operate our business as debtors-in-possession and supply customers and patients with products as normal.

We intend to use the Chapter 11 process to provide a fair, orderly, efficient and legally binding mechanism to implement a RSA pursuant to which, among other things, the parties thereto have agreed to support:

•a financial restructuring that would, among other things, reduce our total debt, improving our financial position and better positioning us for long-term growth;

•the Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement; and

•the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement.

Taken together, these actions are intended to enable us to move forward with our vision to become an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company meeting the needs of underserved patients with severe and critical conditions. 

Subsequent to the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, Chapter 11 proceedings commenced by a limited subset of the Debtors have been recognized and given effect in Canada, and separately Mallinckrodt plc has commenced an examinership process with the High Court of Ireland. The references to the Chapter 11 Cases included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K shall include, where applicable, such proceedings in Canada and Ireland. On February 3, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued a written ruling confirming the Chapter 11 plan (which was subsequently revised February 8, 2022 to make minor corrections). On March 2, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Confirmation Order confirming the fourth amended joint plan of reorganization (with technical modifications) proposed by the Debtors. While we have achieved these significant milestones, consummation of the Plan and emergence from the Chapter 11 Cases remains subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. For further information on the Chapter 11 Cases, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Reorganization items, net

Reorganization items, net, represent amounts incurred after the Petition Date as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases and are comprised of professional fees and adjustments to reflect the carrying value of liabilities subject to compromise ("LSTC") at their estimated allowed claim amounts, as such adjustments are approved by the Bankruptcy Court. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, reorganization items, net were $428.2 million and $61.4 million, respectively.

During fiscal 2020 we incurred $55.7 million and $93.4 million in opioid defense costs and separation costs, respectively, which were both included within SG&A expenses. As of the Petition Date, the majority of these costs are being classified on a go-forward basis as reorganization items, net, as they directly relate to the Chapter 11 proceedings. 

Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. Although the Bankruptcy Court has entered the Confirmation Order confirming the plan of reorganization proposed by the Debtors, consummation of such plan of reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby and emergence from the Chapter 11 proceedings remains subject to the satisfaction of various conditions, including completion of the Canadian and Irish proceedings. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the plan of reorganization or the transactions contemplated thereby will be consummated. As a result, we have concluded that management's plans at this stage do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

StrataGraft

On June 15, 2021, we announced that the FDA had approved the StrataGraft BLA for the treatment of adults with deep partial-thickness burns and during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we released our first commercial shipment of the product. Concurrent with the approval of StrataGraft, the FDA granted us a Priority Review Voucher ("PRV"). A PRV is a voucher that may be used to obtain an accelerated FDA review of one of our future products or sold to a third party to obtain accelerated review of one of its future products. 

Terlipressin

During September 2020, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA seeking approval for the investigational agent terlipressin to treat adults with HRS-1. The CRL stated that, based on the available data, the agency cannot approve the terlipressin NDA in its current form and requires more information to support a positive risk-benefit profile for terlipressin for patients with HRS-1. 

53

In response to receipt of the CRL, we had an End of Review Meeting on October 26, 2020 and a Type A Meeting on January 29, 2021 with the FDA where both parties engaged in constructive dialogue in an effort to clarify a viable path to approval. On August 18, 2021, we resubmitted our NDA for terlipressin to the FDA and on February 18, 2022 (the PDUFA date), the FDA issued a CRL. In the weeks leading up to the PDUFA date, it became necessary for us to identify a new packaging and labeling manufacturing facility, which meant that an inspection by the FDA could not be completed by the PDUFA date. A satisfactory inspection is required before the NDA can be approved. This is the only outstanding issue noted in the CRL, and it is important to note that there were no safety or efficacy issues cited. We are working with the new facility to have it ready for inspection by the FDA. We remain committed to this critically ill patient population, who currently have no approved treatment option in the U.S for HRS-1 and we believe that there is a path to approval in 2022. We will continue to assess the impact of any changes to planned revenue or earnings on the fair value of the associated in-process research and development ("IPR&D") asset of $81.0 million included within intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and December 25, 2020. 

Amitiza

During the three months ended December 31, 2021, due to lower anticipated cash flows expected from Amitiza, we identified a triggering event with respect to the Amitiza intangible asset within the Specialty Brands segment and assessed the recoverability of the definite-lived asset. We determined that the undiscounted cash flows related to the Amitiza intangible asset were less than its net book value, which required us to record an impairment charge of $90.4 million for the difference between the fair value of the Amitiza intangible asset and its net book value. 

MNK-6105 and MNK-6106

During fiscal 2021, we decided that we would no longer pursue further development of this asset. As a result, we recognized a full impairment on our Specialty Brands IPR&D asset related to MNK-6105 and MNK-6106 of $64.5 million. 

Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations 

COVID-19 Business Update 

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. As we navigate the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to supporting our employees, customers, patients and the broader communities in which we operate. 

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to manufacture, supply and deliver our products largely without interruption. At present, we do not anticipate significant COVID-19-related manufacturing or supply chain disruptions, and we continue to evaluate our end-to-end supply chain and assess opportunities to refine our processes going forward.

We expect the coming months to continue to be challenging due to the impact of COVID-19. Our business performance was significantly impacted by COVID-19 during fiscal 2021 and 2020. The ultimate business impact going forward will largely be determined by the ongoing return to work guidance issued by international, national, and local governments and health officials and organizations. We are monitoring the demand for our products, including the duration and degree to which we may see declines in customer orders or delays in starting new patients on a product, such as Acthar Gel, due to the limited ability of our sales representatives to meet with physicians and patients to visit their doctors and pharmacists to receive prescriptions for certain of our products. In regards to Acthar Gel, we continue to see a reduction in new patients, which may impact results in fiscal 2022. Furthermore, while we are supporting the continuation of ongoing patients in our clinical trials, as much as possible, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials. 

Given the rapid and evolving nature of the COVID-19 virus, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included within this report.

Specialty Brands

Net sales of Ofirmev decreased $247.6 million or 89.5%, to $28.9 million driven primarily by the entrance of generic competition during fiscal 2021.

Net sales of Acthar Gel for fiscal 2021 decreased $174.3 million, or 22.7%, to $593.6 million driven primarily by the marketplace 

54

impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending. We anticipate that competition will likely intensify in relation to our Acthar Gel product following ANI's expected commercial launch of their purified cortrophin gel product during the first quarter of 2022, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. ANI's purified cortrophin gel product was recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of certain chronic autoimmune disorders, including acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, in addition to excess urinary protein due to nephrotic syndrome. We continue our efforts to extend the value of the Acthar Gel product through product enhancements including the ongoing development of the Acthar Gel self-injection device, which will create an easier and more patient-friendly application for single unit dosage indications, as well as through conducting and sponsoring additional studies of the drug.

Net sales for INOmax decreased $125.6 million or 21.9% to $448.5 million driven primarily by increased competition following the launch of a competitive nitric oxide product before the expiration of the last of the listed patents on May 3, 2036 (November 3, 2036 including pediatric exclusivity), which could continue to adversely affect our ability to successfully maximize the value of INOmax and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We continue to develop and pursue patent protection of next generation nitric oxide delivery systems and additional uses of nitric oxide. We further intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to our nitric oxide products against any additional parties that may seek to market an alternative version of our INOmax product and/or next generation delivery systems.

Specialty Generics

Net sales from the Specialty Generics segment were $661.8 million for fiscal 2021 compared to $689.8 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease in net sales was driven primarily by increased competition and a change in product mix due to market shifts as a result of COVID-19.

Results of Operations

This report contains certain financial measures, including net sales, gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales, which exclude the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit that is included as a component of net sales for fiscal 2020. For further information on the Medicaid lawsuit, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We have provided these measures because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance. In addition, we believe that they will be used by certain investors to measure Mallinckrodt's operating results. Management believes that presenting these measures provides useful information about our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. These measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

Because these measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease our reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements and this report in its entirety. A reconciliation of certain of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included herein.

Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2020 

Net Sales

Net sales by geographic area are as follows (dollars in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Not meaningful

Net sales in fiscal 2021 were $2,208.8 million, which was relatively flat when compared with $2,213.4 million in fiscal 2020. 

55

Net sales (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit) in fiscal 2021 decreased $540.6 million, or 19.7%, to $2,208.8 million, compared with $2,749.4 million in fiscal 2020. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our Specialty Brands segment including a significant decrease in net sales of Ofirmev, Acthar Gel and INOmax, as previously discussed. For further information on changes in our net sales, refer to "Business Segment Results" within this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Operating Loss 

Gross profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2021 increased $222.3 million, or 33.2%, to $891.7 million, compared with $669.4 million in fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily driven by the retrospective one-time charge of $536.0 million reflected as a component of net sales related to the Medicaid lawsuit in fiscal 2020.

Gross profit (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit) in fiscal 2021 decreased $313.7 million, or 26.0%, to $891.7 million, compared with $1,205.4 million in fiscal 2020. Gross profit margin was 40.4% for fiscal 2021, compared with 43.8% in fiscal 2020. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the $540.6 million decrease in net sales, as discussed above, as well as a change in product mix. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2021 were $581.8 million, compared with $884.1 million for fiscal 2020, a decrease of $302.3 million, or 34.2%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 26.3% for fiscal 2021, compared to 39.9%, or 32.2% % when excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit, for fiscal 2020. These decreases were primarily driven by the bankruptcy-related professional fees being classified as reorganization items, net, subsequent to the Petition Date. Comparatively, during fiscal 2020, we incurred $93.4 million and $55.7 million in separation costs and opioid defense costs, respectively, that were reflected in SG&A. These decreases were also driven by cost containment initiatives and lower employee compensation costs, coupled with a $7.4 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities during fiscal 2021, compared to a $9.9 million increase during fiscal 2020. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase to our environmental liabilities during fiscal 2021. 

Research and development expenses. R&D expenses decreased $85.6 million, or 29.4%, to $205.2 million in fiscal 2021, compared with $290.8 million in fiscal 2020. This decrease was driven by the completion of certain development programs coupled with the abandonment of the MNK-6105 and MNK-6106 asset in fiscal 2021. The Company continues to focus current R&D activities on performing clinical studies and publishing clinical and non-clinical experiences and evidence that support health economic activities and patient outcomes. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses were 9.3% for fiscal 2021 compared to 13.1%, or 10.6% when excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit, for fiscal 2020, respectively.

Restructuring and related charges, net. During fiscal 2021, we recognized $29.0 million of restructuring and related charges, net, of which $2.1 million related to accelerated depreciation and was included in SG&A. The remaining $26.9 million primarily related to employee severance and benefits. The fiscal 2020 charge of $49.8 million, which included $12.3 million related to accelerated depreciation, primarily related to the exiting of our Bedminster, New Jersey facility as we moved our Specialty Brands commercial headquarters from Bedminster to Hampton, New Jersey, as well as employee severance and benefits. 

Non-restructuring impairment charges. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $154.9 million for fiscal 2021 resulting from a partial impairment of $90.4 million related to the Amitiza intangible asset and a full impairment of $64.5 million related to the MNK-6105 and MNK-6106 IPR&D asset. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $63.5 million for fiscal 2020 primarily related to the partial impairment related to the Ofirmev intangible asset.

Losses (gains) on divestiture. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we incurred a loss on divestiture of $0.8 million and a gain of $16.6 million, respectively. Fiscal 2020 included a gain of $16.5 million, related to the achievement of milestones affiliated with the sale of a portion of our Hemostasis business in fiscal 2018 to Baxter International, Inc. ("Baxter").

Opioid-related litigation settlement loss (gain). During fiscal 2021, we recorded a charge of $125.0 million as a result of an additional payment expected to be made on the eighth anniversary of the effective date of the Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement, in accordance with the agreement in principle reached on September 2, 2021. For further information, refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of the Annual Report on Form 10-K. For fiscal 2020, we recorded a gain of $43.4 million due to the decrease in the fair value of the New Opioid Warrants, which were determined to have no value given we cannot reasonably estimate the equity value at emergence.

Medicaid lawsuit. During fiscal 2020, we incurred a retrospective one-time charge of $105.1 million, which represents a pre-acquisition contingency related to the portion of the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate that arose from sales of Acthar Gel prior to our acquisition of Questcor in August 2014.

Non-Operating Items 

Interest expense and interest income. During fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, net interest expense was $220.7 million and $255.2 million, respectively. The $38.5 million decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to a $72.5 million decrease resulting from the cessation of interest accruals as of the Petition Date on outstanding unsecured pre-petition debt classified as LSTC in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, coupled with a lower average outstanding debt balance and a $7.6 million decrease in the amortization of discount and debt issuance costs. This decrease was partially offset by a $51.4 million increase in expense related to 

56

adequate protection payments in fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020. Additionally, fiscal 2021 and 2020 included the recognition of a $15.8 million and $19.2 million benefit to interest expense, respectively, due to lapses of certain statutes of limitations. Interest income decreased $4.0 million to $1.9 million during fiscal 2021, compared to $5.9 million during fiscal 2020, primarily driven by interest earned on our preferred equity certificates that were received as contingent consideration related to the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business during fiscal 2020 and lower interest rates during fiscal 2021.

Other income, net. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded other income, net, of $22.0 million and $7.4 million, respectively. This increase was primarily driven by $9.0 million of one-time milestone receivables in fiscal 2021, coupled with a $6.8 million one-time Japanese consumption tax credit. The remaining activity in both periods represented unrealized gains on our equity investment in Silence, non-service pension expense and other items, including gains and losses on intercompany financing, foreign currency transactions and related hedging instruments.

Reorganization items, net. During fiscal 2021 and 2020, we recorded $428.2 million and $61.4 million of reorganization items, net in conjunction with our Chapter 11 proceedings, respectively. The fiscal 2021 charges included $405.6 million of advisor and legal fees directly related to the Chapter 11 Cases and $23.1 million of deferred financing fee write-offs related to the senior secured term loan due September 2024 (the "2017 Term Loan"), senior secured term loan due February 2025 (the "2018 Term Loan") and second lien senior notes in order to reflect the carrying value of the notes within LSTC on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, at their estimated allowed claim amounts. The fiscal 2020 charges included $51.1 million of advisor and legal fees directly related to the Chapter 11 Cases and $10.2 million of deferred financing fee write-offs related to the unsecured notes.

(Benefit) expense from income taxes. During fiscal 2021, we recognized an income tax benefit of $106.3 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $829.8 million. The fiscal 2021 income tax benefit was comprised of $46.4 million of current tax benefit and $59.9 million of deferred tax benefit. The current tax benefit was primarily the result of an increase to prepaid taxes and a decrease to uncertain tax positions. The deferred tax benefit was predominately related to intangible asset amortization, partially offset by utilization of loss carryforwards in non-valuation allowance jurisdictions. During fiscal 2020, we recognized an income tax expense of $8.9 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $960.8 million. The fiscal 2020 income tax expense was comprised of $375.3 million of current tax benefit and $384.2 million of deferred tax expense. The current tax benefit was primarily the result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act and unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the fiscal 2020 reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership. The deferred tax expense was predominantly related to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, and the fiscal 2020 reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership. 

Our effective tax rate was 12.8% and negative 0.9% for fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was most significantly impacted by the tax benefit of $286.3 million predominately related to changes in the jurisdictional mix of operating loss resulting from the fiscal 2020 reorganization of the Company's intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership and a $9.7 million tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions, partially offset with $189.7 million of tax expense associated with valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets in applicable tax jurisdictions. Additional impacts to the fiscal 2021 effective tax rate include a tax benefit of $49.9 million associated with $428.2 million of reorganization items, net, $34.8 million of tax benefit associated with an impairment charge of $154.9 million, and $21.1 million of tax benefit associated with the $125.0 million opioid-related litigation settlement charge. These additional impacts are significantly offset with the above referenced valuation allowance, thus resulting in a tax benefit of $15.0 million included within our jurisdictional mix of operating loss. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was most significantly impacted by $618.2 million of tax expense associated with valuation allowances and an $82.0 million tax expense associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership, partially offset by a $281.5 million tax benefit associated with the CARES Act and $11.9 million of tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions. Additional impacts to the fiscal 2020 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $11.8 million associated with $93.4 million of separation costs, $5.4 million of tax benefit associated with $61.4 million of reorganization items, net, $0.5 million of tax benefit associated with $25.3 million of share-based compensation, and no tax expense associated with a gain of $43.4 million due to the decrease in the fair value of the New Opioid Warrants. All of these additional impacts are offset with the above referenced valuation allowance, thus resulting in no net impact on tax expense or benefit. 

Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. We recorded income of $6.1 million and $25.1 million on discontinued operations, net of income taxes, during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2021 and 2020 both included the recognition of a tax benefit related to a release of tax and interest on unrecognized tax benefits due to lapses of certain statutes of limitations related to the Nuclear Imaging business. The remaining income during fiscal 2020 primarily related to the receipt of contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business, partially offset by various post-sale adjustments associated with our previous divestitures.

Fiscal Year Ended December 25, 2020 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended December 27, 2019 

Net Sales

Net sales by geographic area are as follows (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Not meaningful

Net sales in fiscal 2020 decreased $949.1 million, or 30.0%, to $2,213.4 million, compared with $3,162.5 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the retrospective one-time charge of $536.0 million reflected as a component of net sales related to the Medicaid lawsuit.

Net sales (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit) in fiscal 2020 decreased $413.1 million, or 13.1%, to $2,749.4 million, compared with $3,162.5 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our Specialty Brands segment including a significant decrease in net sales of Acthar Gel and Ofirmev, as previously discussed. In addition, Other Specialty Brands products included an additional $40.1 million of net sales in fiscal 2019 related to BioVectra, Inc. ("BioVectra") prior to the completion of the sale of this business in November 2019. For further information on changes in our net sales, refer to "Business Segment Results" within this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Operating Loss 

Gross profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2020 decreased $752.0 million, or 52.9%, to $669.4 million, compared with $1,421.4 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the retrospective one-time charge of $536.0 million reflected as a component of net sales related to the Medicaid lawsuit.

Gross profit (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit) in fiscal 2020 decreased $216.0 million, or 15.2%, to $1,205.4 million, compared with $1,421.4 million in fiscal 2019. Gross profit margin was 43.8% for fiscal 2020, compared with 44.9% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the $413.1 million decrease in net sales, as discussed above, as well as the change in product mix driven by the decrease in Acthar Gel net sales. This decrease was partially offset by decreases in amortization in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 had additional amortization related to the Ofirmev intangible asset resulting from an accelerated amortization method, and amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment related to Amitiza, which was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2019.

Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2020 were $884.1 million, compared with $831.0 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $53.1 million, or 6.4%. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 39.9% for fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit, as previously discussed above), SG&A expenses were 32.2% and 26.3% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. These increases were attributable to a $9.9 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities in fiscal 2020, compared to a $60.2 million decrease in fiscal 2019, a $29.4 million increase in separation costs, as well as an increase in employee compensation and benefits driven by certain changes made to the design of our long-term incentive compensation program in an effort to manage share usage and dilution and the approval of a key employee incentive program during fiscal 2020, both of which reflect the shorter-term nature of our target opportunities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in legal expenses driven by a $28.2 million charge during fiscal 2019 associated with the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases, as defined within Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, decreased professional fees, and a decrease in travel expense due to temporary travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19. 

Research and development expenses. R&D expenses decreased $58.6 million, or 16.8%, to $290.8 million in fiscal 2020, compared with $349.4 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was driven by the completion of certain development programs as well as a $20.0 million upfront payment made to Silence during fiscal 2019. The Company continues to focus current R&D activities on performing clinical studies and publishing clinical and non-clinical experiences and evidence that support health economic activities and patient outcomes. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses were 13.1% for fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit, as previously discussed above), R&D expenses were 10.6% and 11.0% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.

58

Restructuring and related charges, net. During fiscal 2020, we recognized $49.8 million of restructuring and related charges, net, of which $12.3 million related to accelerated depreciation and was included in SG&A. The accelerated depreciation and remaining $37.5 million primarily related to the exiting of our Bedminster, New Jersey facility as we moved our Specialty Brands commercial headquarters from Bedminster to Hampton, New Jersey, as well as employee severance and benefits. During fiscal 2019, we recognized a benefit of $1.7 million, of restructuring and related charges, net, primarily related to the settlement of the contract termination costs related to the production of Raplixa resulting in a $14.1 million reversal of the associated restructuring reserve that was previously established in fiscal 2018. This was partially offset by restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefits. 

Non-restructuring impairment charges. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $63.5 million for fiscal 2020 resulting from the partial impairment related to the Ofirmev intangible asset, as previously discussed. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $388.0 million for fiscal 2019 primarily related to a $274.5 million full impairment related to the VTS-270 intangible asset and a $113.5 million full impairment related to the stannsoporfin intangible asset.

(Gains) losses on divestiture. During fiscal 2020 we recorded gains on divestiture of $16.6 million, related to the achievement of milestones affiliated with the sale of a portion of our Hemostasis business in fiscal 2018 to Baxter. During fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of BioVectra for a loss of $33.5 million.

Opioid-related litigation settlement (gain) loss. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a gain of $43.4 million due to the decrease in the fair value of the New Opioid Warrants, which were determined to have no value given we cannot reasonably estimate the equity value at emergence. During fiscal 2019, we recorded a charge of $1,643.4 million attributed to the anticipated structured cash payments and the Settlement Warrants that are to be issued upon effectiveness of the superseded Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement.

Medicaid lawsuit. During fiscal 2020, we incurred a retrospective one-time charge of $105.1 million, which represents a pre-acquisition contingency related to the portion of the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate that arose from sales of Acthar Gel prior to our acquisition of Questcor in August 2014.

Non-Operating Items 

Interest expense and interest income. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, net interest expense was $255.2 million and $299.5 million, respectively. This $44.3 million decrease was attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2020, partially offset by $11.7 million of expense related to adequate protection payments. This yielded a decrease in interest expense of $39.2 million. Additionally, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included the recognition of a $19.2 million and $8.6 million benefit to interest expense, respectively, due to lapses of certain statutes of limitations. For further information, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest income decreased to $5.9 million during fiscal 2020, compared to $9.5 million during fiscal 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates during fiscal 2020, partially offset by interest earned on our preferred equity certificates that were received as contingent consideration related to the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business.

Gains on debt extinguishment, net. During fiscal 2019, we recorded gains on debt extinguishment, net, of $466.6 million, primarily related to a private exchange of our senior unsecured notes resulting in a gain of $377.4 million, net of the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $4.9 million. For further information, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2019 also included a gain of $98.6 million on debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $492.1 million, partially offset by the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $9.4 million. 

Other income, net. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recorded other income, net, of $7.4 million and $63.6 million, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by a $39.0 million decrease in royalty income, as well as a $16.4 million decrease in unrealized gain on investment related to our equity investment in Silence. The remaining income in both periods represented non-service pension expense and other items, including gains and losses on intercompany financing, foreign currency transactions and related hedging instruments.

Reorganization items, net. During fiscal 2020, we recorded $61.4 million of reorganization items, net in conjunction with our Chapter 11 proceedings. These charges included $51.1 million of advisor and legal fees directly related to the Chapter 11 Cases and $10.2 million of deferred financing fee write-offs related to the unsecured notes in order to reflect the carrying value of the unsecured notes within LSTC on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2020 at their estimated allowed claim amounts. 

Expense (benefit) from income taxes. During fiscal 2020, we recognized an income tax expense of $8.9 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $960.8 million. The fiscal 2020 income tax expense was comprised of $375.3 million of current tax benefit and $384.2 million of deferred tax expense. The current tax benefit was primarily the result of the CARES Act and unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the fiscal 2020 reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership. The deferred tax expense was predominantly related to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, and the fiscal 2020 reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership. During fiscal 2019, we recognized an income tax benefit of $584.3 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $1,591.5 million. The fiscal 2019 income tax benefit was comprised of $21.8 million of current tax expense and $606.1 million of 

59

deferred tax benefit, which was predominantly related to previously acquired intangibles, the opioid-related litigation settlement charge, the generation of tax loss and credit carryforwards net of valuation allowances, the non-restructuring impairment charge, as well as the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership, which eliminated the interest-bearing deferred tax obligation.

Our effective tax rate was negative 0.9% and 36.7% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was most significantly impacted by $618.2 million of tax expense associated with valuation allowances and an $82.0 million tax expense associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership, partially offset by a $281.5 million tax benefit associated with the CARES Act and $11.9 million of tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions. Additional impacts to the fiscal 2020 effective tax rate included a tax benefit of $11.8 million associated with $93.4 million of separation costs, $5.4 million of tax benefit associated with $61.4 million of reorganization items, net, $0.5 million of tax benefit associated with $25.3 million of share-based compensation, and no tax expense associated with a gain of $43.4 million due to the decrease in the fair value of the New Opioid Warrants. All of these additional impacts are offset with the above referenced valuation allowance, thus resulting in no net impact on tax expense or benefit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was most significantly impacted by $212.8 million of tax benefit associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership. Further impacts included a tax benefit of $211.9 million associated with the $1,643.4 million opioid-related litigation settlement charge, $71.9 million of tax benefit associated with $386.3 million of restructuring costs and non-restructuring impairment charges, $18.7 million of tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions, $13.5 million of tax benefit primarily associated with U.S. tax credits, $11.4 million of tax benefit associated with separation costs of $63.9 million, $10.2 million of tax expense associated with a gain on debt extinguishment of $466.6 million, $8.0 million of tax benefit associated with a legal settlement charge of $28.2 million, $7.6 million of tax expense associated with the $60.2 million of income from the decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and zero tax impact associated with a $33.5 million loss associated with the sale of BioVectra. Remaining impacts were related to the impact of recent acquisitions.

Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. We recorded income of $25.1 million and $10.7 million on discontinued operations, net of income taxes, during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2020 included the recognition of a tax benefit related to a release of tax and interest on unrecognized tax benefits due to a lapse of certain statutes of limitations related to the Nuclear Imaging business. The remaining income during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 primarily related to the receipt of contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business, partially offset by various post-sale adjustments associated with our previous divestitures.

Business Segment Results 

Management measures and evaluates our operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non-recurring or non-operational are excluded from segment net sales and operating income because management and the chief operating decision maker evaluate the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items include, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, net restructuring charges, non-restructuring impairment charges, separation costs, R&D upfront payments, changes related to the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement and the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate incurred as a result of the Medicaid lawsuit. Although these amounts are excluded from segment net sales and segment operating income, as applicable, they are included in reported consolidated net sales and operating (loss) income and in the reconciliations presented below. Selected information by business segment is as follows:

Specialty Brands. Net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased $512.6 million, or 24.9%, to $1,547.0 million, compared with $2,059.6 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease was primarily driven by a $247.6 million, or 89.5%, decrease in Ofirmev driven by the loss of exclusivity at the end of fiscal 2020 and the entrance of generic competition during fiscal 2021. The decrease in net sales was also impacted by a $174.3 million, or 22.7%, decrease in Acthar Gel net sales driven primarily by the marketplace impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending and a $125.6 million, or 21.9%, decrease in INOmax due to increased competition. These decreases were partially offset by a $27.9 million, or 11.7%, increase in Therakos net sales driven by increased demand as the product begun to see a recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first half of fiscal 2021 and an $8.1 million, or 4.3%, increase in Amitiza, primarily as a result of the royalty from Par beginning in fiscal 2021.

Specialty Generics. Net sales for fiscal 2021 decreased $28.0 million, or 4.1%, to $661.8 million, compared to $689.8 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease in net sales was driven by a $17.2 million, or 5.9%, and $15.3 million, or 15.6%, decrease in other controlled substances and hydrocodone-related products, respectively, driven by an increased competitive environment. These decreases were partially offset by a $2.9 million, or 1.4%, and $1.5 million, or 7.3%, increase in acetaminophen and other products net sales, respectively.

Operating Loss

Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2021 and 2020 is shown in the following table (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes administration expenses and certain compensation, legal, environmental and other costs not charged to our reportable segments.

(2)Represents costs included in SG&A expenses, primarily related to professional fees and costs incurred in preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings. As of the Petition Date, professional fees directly related to the Chapter 11 proceedings that were previously reflected as separation costs were classified on a go-forward basis as reorganization items, net.

(3)Represents R&D expense incurred related to an upfront payment made to acquire product rights in Japan for terlipressin in fiscal 2020.

Specialty Brands. Operating income for fiscal 2021 decreased $202.9 million to $812.8 million, compared with $1,015.7 million for fiscal 2020. Operating margin increased to 52.5% for fiscal 2021, compared with 49.3% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in operating income is primarily driven by the $512.6 million, or 24.9%, decrease in net sales over the same period, which resulted in a $410.0 million decrease in gross profit. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating income and serving to increase operating margin was a $125.9 million, or 26.2%, decrease in SG&A expenses primarily driven by cost containment initiatives and lower employee compensation costs in addition to bankruptcy-related legal fees being classified as reorganization items, net, subsequent to the Petition Date, and an $81.3 million, or 33.7%, decrease in R&D expenses driven by the completion of certain development programs during fiscal 2020, coupled with the decision to no longer pursue further development of the MNK-6105 and MNK-6106 asset in fiscal 2021.

Specialty Generics. Operating income for fiscal 2021 decreased $98.5 million to $107.9 million, compared with $206.4 million for fiscal 2020. Operating margin decreased to 16.3% for fiscal 2021, compared with 29.9% for fiscal 2020. The decrease in operating income and operating margin was primarily attributable to a $97.1 million decrease in gross profit, primarily driven by an increased competitive environment with respect to other controlled substances and hydrocodone-related products.

Corporate and unallocated expenses. Corporate and unallocated expenses were $129.6 million and $166.1 million for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by the bankruptcy-related professional fees being classified as reorganization items, net, subsequent to the Petition Date, in addition to cost containment initiatives and lower employee compensation costs. Comparatively, during fiscal 2020, we incurred $55.7 million of opioid defense costs that were reflected in SG&A. The decrease also included changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities with a $7.4 million gain during fiscal 2021 compared to a $9.9 million charge during fiscal 2020. The decrease was partially offset by a $35.0 million increase to our environmental remediation liabilities during fiscal 2021.

Specialty Brands. Net sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $364.2 million, or 15.0%, to $2,059.6 million, compared with $2,423.8 million for fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a $184.8 million, or 19.4%, decrease in Acthar Gel net sales driven primarily by the marketplace impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending. The prospective change to the Medicaid rebate calculation also served to reduce Acthar Gel net sales by $40.4 million during fiscal 2020. The decrease was also driven by a $107.5 million, or 28.0%, decrease in Ofirmev net sales primarily due to overall reduction in elective surgeries due to public health orders implemented as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the product's loss of exclusivity in December 2020. In addition, Other Specialty Brands product sales included an additional $40.1 million of net sales in fiscal 2019 related to BioVectra, which was sold in November 2019, and net sales for Amitiza decreased $19.7 million, or 9.4%, due to decreased volumes driven by increased competition. The remaining decrease relates to Therakos net sales due to stay-at-home directives issued as part of COVID-19 public health orders.

Specialty Generics. Net sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $48.9 million, or 6.6%, to $689.8 million, compared to $738.7 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease in net sales was driven by decreased net sales of $62.6 million, or 17.8%, and $24.6 million, or 54.5%, for Other controlled substance and Other products, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a $23.1 million, or 12.2%, increase in acetaminophen net sales, and a $21.7 million, or 28.4%, increase in hydrocodone-related products net sales.

Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following table (dollars in millions):[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes $10.0 million of inventory fair-value step up expense related to Amitiza during fiscal 2019.

(2)Includes administration expenses and certain compensation, legal, environmental and other costs not charged to our reportable segments.

(3)Represents R&D expense incurred related to an upfront payment made to acquire product rights in Japan for terlipressin in fiscal 2020 and an upfront payment made to Silence in connection with the license and collaboration agreement entered into in fiscal 2019.

Specialty Brands. Operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased $194.4 million to $1,015.7 million, compared with $1,210.1 million for fiscal 2019. Operating margin decreased to 49.3% for fiscal 2020, compared with 49.9% for fiscal 2019. These decreases were primarily driven by the $364.2 million, or 15.0%, decrease in net sales over the same period, which resulted in a $278.9 million decrease in gross profit. This was partially offset by a $47.9 million or 9.1% decrease in SG&A expenses primarily driven by lower travel costs due to temporary travel restrictions for COVID-19, lower consulting and professional fees and a $36.5 million or 13.2% decrease in R&D expenses.

Specialty Generics. Operating income for fiscal 2020 increased $37.9 million to $206.4 million, compared with $168.5 million for fiscal 2019. Operating margin increased to 29.9% for fiscal 2020, compared with 22.8% for fiscal 2019. As a result of the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement announced during the three months ended March 27, 2020, the corresponding opioid defense costs are considered to be non-recurring; therefore, such costs are excluded from segment operating income and presented as a corporate and unallocated expense on a go-forward basis. In comparison, there were $56.2 million of opioid defense costs reflected in operating income during fiscal 2019. This was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit primarily driven by the decrease in net sales.

Corporate and unallocated expenses. Corporate and unallocated expenses were $166.1 million and $102.3 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase was attributable to a $9.9 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration 

64

liabilities in fiscal 2020, compared to a $60.2 million decrease in fiscal 2019, as well as opioid defense costs of $55.7 million being presented as a corporate and unallocated expense beginning during the three months ended March 27, 2020, resulting from the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement, as previously discussed. The remaining increase is primarily related to employee compensation and benefits driven by certain changes made to the design of our long-term incentive compensation program in an effort to manage share usage and dilution and the approval of a key employee incentive program during fiscal 2020. This is partially offset by gains on divestiture in fiscal 2020 of $16.6 million primarily related to the achievement of milestones related to the sale of a portion of our Hemostasis business in fiscal 2018 to Baxter, compared with a $33.5 million loss on the divestiture of BioVectra during fiscal 2019, and lower consulting and professional fees. In addition, fiscal 2019 included a $28.2 million charge associated with the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Significant factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities, financing transactions, capital expenditures, cash paid in connection with legal settlements, acquisitions and licensing agreements and cash received as a result of our divestitures. We have historically generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations. Our ability to fund our capital needs is impacted by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets. Our material cash requirements are highly dependent upon the plan of reorganization and successful emergence from Chapter 11. 

Anticipated Sources and Uses for Chapter 11 Emergence

 In the event we are able to successfully emerge from Chapter 11, our primary cash sources upon emergence are expected to include cash on hand, which was $1,345.0 million as of December 31, 2021, and proceeds of newly incurred debt.

Our primary cash uses upon emergence are expected to include the following:

•$900.0 million revolving credit facility with a stated maturity of February 28, 2022, for which efforts to enforce payment obligations were automatically stayed during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases;

•$450.0 million upfront payment related to our Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement;

•$135.0 million payment of general unsecured claims in accordance with the agreement in principle with the unsecured creditors committee;

•$15.0 million upfront payment related to our Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement; and

•Payment of administrative, priority and trade claims, for which the amount is not yet finalized due to ongoing claims reconciliation efforts; and

•Fees related to exit-financing activities.

Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our plan of reorganization and related expected sources and uses.

Cash Requirements and Sources From Existing Contractual Arrangements

Under the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors may assume, modify, assign or reject certain executory contracts and unexpired leases, including, without limitation, leases of real property and equipment, subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court and to certain other conditions. Generally, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease is treated as a pre-petition breach of such executory contract or unexpired lease and, subject to certain exceptions, relieves the Debtors from performing their future obligations under such executory contract or unexpired lease but entitles the contract counterparty or lessor to a pre-petition general unsecured claim for damages caused by such deemed breach. Generally, the assumption of an executory contract or unexpired lease requires the Debtors to cure existing monetary defaults under such executory contract or unexpired lease and provide adequate assurance of future performance. Accordingly, any description of an executory contract or unexpired lease in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including, where applicable, the express termination rights thereunder or a quantification of their obligations, must be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by, any overriding rejection rights the Debtors have under the Bankruptcy Code.

Our material cash requirements from known contractual obligations include debt obligations, legal settlements, income taxes, lease obligations, purchase obligations and other liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, as presented and discussed below.

65

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in millions):[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on October 12, 2020 constituted an event of default under certain of our debt agreements. Accordingly, all long-term debt is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of our long-term debt instruments are classified as LSTC, for which no principal payments will be made during the pendency of the proceedings. We intend to use the Chapter 11 process to reduce our total debt. For further details on our Chapter 11 proceedings and debt obligations, refer to Notes 2 and 14, respectively of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(2)Interest on long-term debt obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021. Contractual obligations under the long-term debt agreements have been shown in the table above. Certain of our long-term debt instruments are classified as LSTC, with the corresponding contractual interest reflected above, for which no interest payments will be made during the pendency of the proceedings. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. 

We are contractually obligated under the cash collateral order approved by the Bankruptcy Court to make adequate protection payments on the senior secured revolving credit facility and senior secured term loans at a rate that is 200 and 250 basis points, respectively, greater than the otherwise applicable non-default rate based on LIBOR. Under the cash collateral order, we expect to make approximately $15.5 million of adequate protection payments during fiscal 2022, which is subject to change based on ultimate timing of emergence from Chapter 11. This incremental expense, which is classified as interest expense, is reflected above.

For further information regarding the fixed and variable rates of our debt obligations, refer to Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(3)Includes obligations for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less and not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our lease liabilities.

(4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services made in the ordinary course of business to meet operational requirements. 

The preceding table does not include our legal settlement obligations of $1,725.0 million for our Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement and $260.0 million for our Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement, which are further discussed in Note 2 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may be subject to other legal matters that may require further cash requirements that we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected amount or range of cost at this time.

Non-current income taxes payable, primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits, is included within other income tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and, as of December 31, 2021, was $83.2 million. Payment of these liabilities is uncertain and, even if payments are determined to be necessary, they are subject to the timing of rulings by the taxing authorities related to tax positions we take. For further information on income tax related matters, refer to Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are obligated to pay royalties under certain agreements with third parties. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made payments under these arrangements of $14.1 million, $81.9 million and $95.7 million, respectively. The timing and amounts to be paid in future periods are uncertain as they are dependent upon net sales generated in future periods and the ultimate outcome of the Chapter 11 process. The decrease in royalties paid during fiscal 2021 was driven by loss of exclusivity and entrance of competition for our Ofirmev product, which caused a large decline in net sales, coupled with the cessation of Acthar Gel royalty payments as a result of the Chapter 11 process. Accrued royalties related to our Acthar Gel product were $29.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and have been classified as LSTC on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

As of December 31, 2021, we had net unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $27.3 million and $37.3 million, respectively. The timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension and postretirement obligations are uncertain. We do not anticipate making material involuntary contributions in fiscal 2022, but may elect to make voluntary contributions to our defined pension plans or our postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2022. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing on October 12, 2020, $32.0 million defined benefit obligations have been classified as LSTC on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, which included the U.S. pension benefit plans and a portion of the postretirement benefit plans. For further information regarding pension and postretirement benefit obligations, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of cleanup and timing of future cash outlays is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of December 31, 2021, we 

66

believe that it is probable that we will incur investigation and remediation costs of approximately $95.8 million, of which $0.8 million was included in accrued and other current liabilities, $52.0 million was included in LSTC, and the remaining $43.0 million was included in environmental liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Refer to Notes 2 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding LSTC and environmental matters, respectively.

As part of our acquisition of Stratatech Corporation ("Stratatech"), we are subject to a contractual arrangement to pay contingent consideration to former owners of this business. The payment of obligations under this arrangement is uncertain, and even if payments are expected to be made the timing of these payments may be uncertain as well. As of December 31, 2021, we have accrued $27.3 million for these potential payments, which are classified as LSTC. For further information on our contingent consideration arrangement, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In general, we intend to fund capital expenditures with cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had no capital expenditure commitments.

Our remaining cash requirements are obligations that arise from the normal course of our business. 

As part of our divestitures and licensing agreements, we have the potential to earn in excess of $50.0 million in milestone payments in the future. 

A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is provided in the following table (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $455.4 million for fiscal 2021 included a loss of $717.4 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $802.7 million driven by depreciation and amortization of $675.8 million and a $154.9 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Amitiza asset and the MNK-6105 and MNK-6106 asset, partially offset by a $59.9 million reduction in our deferred income tax liabilities. The net loss was also offset by cash provided from net investment in working capital of $370.1 million, which was primarily driven by an increase to the opioid-related litigation settlement liability of $125.0 million, a $108.5 million decrease in net tax receivables driven by the receipt of CARES Act income tax refunds, partially offset by an increase in prepaid income taxes and a $98.2 million decrease in accounts receivable. These inflows were partially offset by a $14.0 million increase in inventory.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $498.9 million for fiscal 2020 included a loss of $944.6 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $1,331.2 million driven by depreciation and amortization of $885.2 million, a $385.3 million reduction in our deferred income tax assets, and a $63.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Ofirmev intangible asset. The net loss was also offset by cash provided from net investment in working capital of $112.3 million, primarily driven by the $638.9 million Medicaid lawsuit liability. Also included within this change in working capital was a $37.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, and a $15.7 million increase in accounts payable, net of transfers to LSTC. These items were offset by a $433.8 million increase in net receivables related to income taxes that was driven by tax benefits from the CARES Act and changes in uncertain tax positions, a $95.3 million net cash outflow related to other assets and liabilities primarily driven by decreases in accrued payroll and accrued restructuring, net of transfers to LSTC, and a $51.1 million increase in inventory.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $742.9 million for fiscal 2019 included a loss from continuing operations, as adjusted for non-cash items including a $466.6 million gain on debt extinguishment, net and a $388.0 million adjustment for non-cash impairment charges. The loss from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items was offset by a $1,451.6 million inflow from net changes in working capital, primarily driven by the portion of the opioid-related litigation settlement liability related to the structured cash payments of $1,600.0 million with the remaining $43.4 million related to the Settlement Warrants (as defined in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) reflected as a non-cash item. This was partially offset by a $161.5 million net outflow from other assets and liabilities primarily driven by cash outflows related to separation costs, one time legal settlement payments of $24.0 million and $15.4 

67

million related to the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases and the Questcor DOJ settlement, respectively, a $26.5 million decrease in accrued restructuring charges, a $16.3 million decrease in payroll related accruals and decreases in other accrual balances attributable to cost benefits gained from restructuring actions. 

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $37.8 million for fiscal 2021 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $55.3 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $16.5 million related to the sale of a portion of our Hemostasis business in fiscal 2018.

Net cash used in investing activities of $11.2 million for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $47.7 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $29.8 million for the redemption of 100% of the outstanding preferred equity certificates received as part of contingent earn-out payments related to the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business, as previously discussed. The remaining activity primarily relates to post-sale adjustments from various divestitures.

Net cash used in investing activities of $8.3 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $133.0 million, partially offset by $95.1 million in proceeds received related to the sale of BioVectra, net of cash, as well as proceeds from other long-term asset disposals.

Under our term loan credit agreement and our notes, the proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses must be either reinvested into capital expenditures or business development activities within one year of the respective transaction or we are required to make prepayments on our term loans and offer to repurchase certain of our notes.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $137.5 million for fiscal 2021, compared with $185.6 million for fiscal 2020. This decrease was primarily attributable to payments of contingent considerations related to the acquisition of Questcor and Stratatech during fiscal 2020 of $25.0 million and $20.0 million, respectively, $9.4 million in debt issuance costs incurred in fiscal 2020 and a $2.0 million decrease in debt repayments. Our fiscal 2021 debt repayments included $137.5 million in aggregate payments on our variable-rate term loans. Our fiscal 2020 debt repayments included a $119.8 million payment on the remaining principal amount of the 4.875% senior unsecured notes that had a maturity date of April 15, 2020, and $19.7 million in aggregate payments on our variable-rate senior secured term loans.

Net cash used in financing activities was $185.6 million for fiscal 2020, compared with $280.1 million for fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $110.6 million decrease in debt repayments, net of issuances. The significant components of our debt repayments during fiscal 2019 included aggregate debt repayments of $286.4 million on our variable-rate term loans, open market debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $492.1 million and a repayment of $250.0 million on the receivable securitization program. These repayments were partially offset by a net draw of $680.0 million on our revolving credit facility.

Concentration of Credit and Other Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of accounts receivable. We generally do not require collateral from customers. A portion of our accounts receivable outside the U.S. includes sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries' national economies. 

Capitalization

Shareholders' equity was $313.4 million at December 31, 2021 compared with $1,019.2 million at December 25, 2020. The decrease in shareholders' equity is primarily attributed to the fiscal 2021 net loss.

From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors have authorized share repurchase programs. We did not make any share repurchases during fiscal 2021 or fiscal 2020. For further information, refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Dividends

Historically, we have not made any cash dividend payments, as we have retained earnings to finance acquisitions, R&D and the operation and expansion of our business, while executing disciplined capital allocation. Currently, the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court until such proceedings are complete upon emergence.

Commitments and Contingencies

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including present and former operations, including those described in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe, unless otherwise indicated, given the information currently available, that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Guarantees

In disposing of assets or businesses, we have from time to time provided representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks and liabilities, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to disposition. We assess the probability of potential liabilities related to such representations, warranties and indemnities and adjust potential liabilities as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. We believe, given the information currently available, that the ultimate resolutions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These representations, warranties and indemnities are discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2021, we had various other letters of credit, guarantees and surety bonds totaling $34.7 million and restricted cash of $41.2 million held in segregated accounts primarily to collateralize surety bonds for our environmental liabilities. 

Critical Accounting Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The following critical accounting estimates are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Liabilities Subject to Compromise

As a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the payment of pre-petition liabilities is subject to compromise or other treatment pursuant to a plan of reorganization. The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be settled or treated cannot be made until the confirmed Chapter 11 plan of reorganization becomes effective. Accordingly, the ultimate amount of such liabilities is not determinable at this time. Pre-petition liabilities that are subject to compromise are to be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for different amounts. The amounts currently classified as LSTC are preliminary and may be subject to future adjustments depending on Bankruptcy Court actions, further developments with respect to disputed claims, determinations of the secured status of certain claims, the values of any collateral securing such claims, rejection of executory contracts, continued reconciliation or other events.

Revenue Recognition

Product Sales Revenue

We sell products through independent channels, including direct to retail pharmacies, end user customers and through distributors who resell our products to retail pharmacies, institutions and end user customers, while certain products are sold and distributed directly to hospitals. We also enter into arrangements with indirect customers, such as health care providers and payers, wholesalers, government agencies, institutions, managed care organizations and GPOs to establish contract pricing for certain products that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, sales incentives, chargebacks, distribution service agreement fees, fees for services and administration fees and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products. 

69

Reserve for Variable Considerations

Product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. These reserves result from estimated chargebacks, rebates, product returns and other sales deductions that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, health care providers and payers relating to the sale of our products. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, estimated future trends, estimated customer inventory levels, current contracted sales terms with customers, level of utilization of our products and other competitive factors. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimate of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained (reduced), and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. We adjust reserves for chargebacks, rebates, product returns and other sales deductions to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. Such adjustments impact the amount of net sales recognized in the period of adjustment.

 The following table reflects activity in our sales reserve accounts (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Excludes the $105.1 million that is reflected as a component of operating expenses as it represents a pre-acquisition contingency related to the portion of the liability that arose from sales of Acthar Gel prior to the Company's acquisition of Questcor. in August 2014. For further information, refer to Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Provisions presented in the table above are recorded as reductions to net sales. As of December 31, 2021, a five percent change in our sales reserve accounts would have led to an approximately $13.6 million impact on our loss from continuing operations before income taxes. For our presentation of net sales by product family, refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Total provisions for fiscal 2021 decreased $524.3 million compared with fiscal 2020, which was inclusive of the $536.0 million provision for the Medicaid lawsuit incurred in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of the Medicaid lawsuit, the increase in rebates and chargebacks of $21.2 million primarily related to an increase of $32.7 million in the Specialty Generics segment as result of pricing pressure on our business, partially offset by an $11.5 million decrease in Specialty Brands. Provisions for returns decreased $5.2 million driven by the Specialty Generics segment, and other sales deductions decreased by $4.3 million from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021.

Total provisions for fiscal 2020 increased $252.6 million compared with fiscal 2019, which was inclusive of the $536.0 million provision for the Medicaid lawsuit incurred in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of the Medicaid lawsuit, the decrease in rebates and chargebacks of $281.4 million primarily related to a decrease of $315.2 million in the Specialty Generics segment driven by decreased pricing resulting in lower chargeback amounts, offset by a $33.8 million increase in Specialty Brands. Provisions for returns increased $6.7 million driven by the Specialty Generics segment, and other sales deductions increased by $8.7 million from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. 

Product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product. Control is transferred either at a point in time, generally upon delivery to the customer site, or in the case of certain of our products, over the period in which the customer has access to the product and related services. Revenue recognized over time is based upon either consumption of the product or passage of time based upon our determination of the measure that best aligns with how the obligation is satisfied. Our considerations of why such measures provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of our products are as follows:

•For those contracts whereby revenue is recognized over time based upon consumption of the product, we either have:

70

1.the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date, for which the practical expedient to recognize in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice has been applied, or

2.the remaining goods and services to which the customer is entitled is diminished upon consumption.

•For those contracts whereby revenue is recognized over time based upon the passage of time, the benefit that the customer receives from unlimited access to our product does not vary, regardless of consumption. As a result, our obligation diminishes with the passage of time; therefore, ratable recognition of the transaction price over the contract period is the measure that best aligns with how the obligation is satisfied.

For additional information, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include completed technology, licenses, trademarks and IPR&D. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value, while intangible assets acquired in other transactions are recorded at cost. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are subsequently amortized, generally using the straight-line method over five to thirty years. We assess the remaining useful life and the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When a triggering event occurs, we evaluate potential impairment of finite-lived intangible assets by first comparing undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset, or the asset group they are a part of, to its carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the amount of potential impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets, or asset group, with their carrying value. The fair value of the intangible asset, or asset group, is estimated using an income approach. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, or asset group, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the fair value of the asset. We annually test the indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable by either a qualitative or income approach. We compare the fair value of the assets with their carrying value and record an impairment when the carrying value exceeds the fair value. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in intangible asset impairment in future periods. 

For more information on our intangible impairment analyses and the results thereof, refer to Notes 3 and 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Acquisitions

For acquisitions that meet the criteria for business combination accounting, the amounts paid are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations. These valuations rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to estimate the fair value of individual assets acquired in a business combination. Due to these inherent uncertainties, there is risk that the carrying value of our recorded intangible assets may be overstated, which may result in an increased risk of impairment in future periods. We perform our intangible asset valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in impairment in future periods.

Our purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval.

The fair value of IPR&D is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the fair value of IPR&D, we consider, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used includes a rate of return that accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.

The fair value attributable to IPR&D projects at the time of acquisition is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and tested annually for impairment until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon completion of the project, the indefinite-lived 

71

intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is charged to expense.

Certain asset acquisitions or license agreements may not meet the criteria for a business combination. We account for these transactions as an asset acquisition and recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. Any initial up-front payments incurred in connection with the acquisition or licensing of IPR&D product candidates that do not meet the definition of a business are treated as research and development expense.

Contingent Consideration

As part of certain acquisitions, we are subject to contractual arrangements to pay contingent consideration to former owners of these businesses. The payment of obligations under these arrangements are uncertain, and even if payments are expected to be made the timing of these payments may be uncertain as well. These contingent consideration obligations are required to be recorded at fair value within the consolidated balance sheet and adjusted at each respective balance sheet date, with changes in the fair value being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The determination of fair value is dependent upon a number of factors, which include projections of future revenues, the probability of successfully achieving certain regulatory milestones, competitive entrants into the marketplace, the timing associated with the aforementioned criteria and market place data (e.g., interest rates). Several of these assumptions require projections several years into the future. Due to these inherent uncertainties, there is risk that the contingent consideration liabilities may be overstated or understated. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions are expected to impact future operating results, with the magnitude of the impact tied to the significance in the change in assumptions. For additional information, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contingencies

We are involved, either as a plaintiff or a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, government investigations, environmental matters, product liability matters, patent infringement claims, antitrust matters, securities class action lawsuits, personal injury claims, employment disputes, contractual and other commercial disputes, and other legal proceedings, all in the ordinary course of business as further discussed in Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accruals recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims, are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel, internal and/or external technical consultants and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period as additional information becomes available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provisions are recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount. We record receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the related liability when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. Receivables are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.

As previously discussed, we concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. We considered this in determining that certain net deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not realizable. As a result, we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our net 

72

deferred tax assets. Our income tax benefit or expense recorded in the future may be impacted to the extent of changes in our valuation allowances.

We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50.0% likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability, or a reduction to a deferred tax asset (“contra-DTA”), is established. We adjust these liabilities and contra-DTAs as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. 

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes, however, which would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Refer to Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
