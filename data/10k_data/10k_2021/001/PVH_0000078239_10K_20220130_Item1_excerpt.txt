We also make available at no cost on PVH.com, the charters of the committees of the PVH Board of Directors, as well as our Corporate Governance Guidelines and Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.

Company Overview

We are one of the largest global apparel companies in the world. We have approximately 31,000 associates operating in more than 40 countries and generated $9.2 billion, $7.1 billion and $9.9 billion in revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our business was significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, resulting in an unprecedented material decline in revenue. Revenue in 2021 continued to be negatively impacted by the pandemic and related supply chain disruptions, although to a much lesser extent than in 2020. 

We manage a portfolio of iconic brands, including TOMMY HILFIGER, Calvin Klein, Warner’s, Olga and True&Co., which are owned, Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW and Geoffrey Beene, which we owned through the second quarter of 2021 and now license back for certain product categories, and other licensed brands. We refer to our owned and licensed trademarks, other than TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein, as our “heritage brands” and the businesses we operate under the heritage brands trademarks as our Heritage Brands business. We entered into a definitive agreement in the second quarter of 2021 to sell certain of our brands, including Van Heusen, IZOD, ARROW, and Geoffrey Beene, as well as certain related inventories of our Heritage Brands business, to Authentic Brands Group (“ABG”) and other parties (the “Heritage Brands transaction”). We completed the sale on August 2, 2021 (the first day of the third quarter of 2021).

We design and market branded sportswear (casual apparel), jeanswear, performance apparel, intimate apparel, underwear, swimwear, dress shirts, neckwear, handbags, accessories, footwear and other related products. Our brands are positioned to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer differentiated products to a broad range of consumers, reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. We also license the use of our trademarks to third parties and joint ventures for product categories and in regions where we believe our licensees’ expertise can better serve our brands. 

1 

Our directly operated businesses in North America during 2021 consisted principally of (i) wholesale sales under our TOMMY HILFIGER, Calvin Klein and heritage brands trademarks; (ii) the operation of digital commerce sites under our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks; and (iii) the operation of retail stores, principally in premium outlet centers, under our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks. We announced in 2020 plans to streamline our North American operations to better align our business with the evolving retail landscape, including the exit from our Heritage Brands Retail business, which consisted of 162 directly operated stores in North America. We completed the exit from the business in 2021. Our directly operated businesses outside of North America consisted principally of (i) our wholesale and retail sales in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region under our TOMMY HILFIGER trademarks; (ii) our wholesale and retail sales in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America under our Calvin Klein trademarks; and (iii) the operation of digital commerce sites in Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin America, under the TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks. Our licensing activities principally related to the licensing worldwide of our TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein trademarks for a broad array of product categories and for use in numerous discrete jurisdictions.

We have evolved from our 1881 roots to become a global company with a portfolio of iconic brands through a combination of transformative acquisitions and by successfully growing our brands globally across all channels of distribution. Our key acquisitions include the acquisition of Calvin Klein, Inc. and certain affiliated companies (“Calvin Klein”) in February 2003 (the “Calvin Klein acquisition”), the acquisition of Tommy Hilfiger B.V. and certain affiliated companies (“Tommy Hilfiger”) in May 2010 (the “Tommy Hilfiger acquisition”), and the acquisition of The Warnaco Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Warnaco”) in February 2013 (the “Warnaco acquisition”). We also have acquired several regional licensed businesses and will continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, trademarks and companies that we believe are additive to our overall business.

We licensed Speedo for North America and the Caribbean until April 6, 2020, on which date we sold the Speedo North America business to Pentland Group PLC (“Pentland”), the parent company of the Speedo brand. Upon the closing of the transaction, we deconsolidated the net assets of the Speedo North America business and no longer licensed the Speedo trademark.

We completed the acquisition of the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in Central and Southeast Asia from our previous licensee in that market (the “TH CSAP acquisition”) in July 2019 and now operate directly the Tommy Hilfiger retail business in the Central and Southeast Asia market.

We completed the acquisition of the approximately 78% ownership interests in Gazal Corporation Limited (“Gazal”) that we did not already own (the “Australia acquisition”) in May 2019. Prior to the closing, we, along with Gazal, jointly owned and managed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited (“PVH Australia”), which licensed and operated businesses in Australia, New Zealand and other parts of Oceania under the TOMMY HILFIGER, Calvin Klein and Van Heusen brands, along with other owned and licensed brands. PVH Australia came under our full control as a result of the Australia acquisition and we now operate directly those businesses. 

We aggregate our reportable segments for purposes of discussion in this Report into three main businesses: (i) Tommy Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments; (ii) Calvin Klein, which consists of the Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments; and (iii) Heritage Brands, which consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale and, through the second quarter of 2021, Heritage Brands Retail segments. We announced in 2020 a plan to exit our Heritage Brands Retail business, which was completed in 2021. Our Heritage Brands Retail segment has ceased operations. Note 20, “Segment Data,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report contains information with respect to revenue, income (loss) before interest and taxes, assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures related to each segment, as well as information regarding our revenue generated by distribution channel and based on geographic location, and the geographic locations where our net property, plant and equipment is held. 

We generated revenue of $9.2 billion, $7.1 billion and $9.9 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. Over 60% of our revenue in 2021 and 2020, and over 50% of our revenue in 2019, was generated outside of the United States. Our iconic brands, TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein, together generated over 90% of our revenue during 2021, and over 85% of our revenue during each of 2020 and 2019. Our business was significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020, resulting in an unprecedented material decline in revenue. Revenue in 2021 continued to be negatively impacted by the pandemic, although to a much lesser extent than in 2020. Please see our Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Item 7 of this report for further discussion.

 Our Business Strategy

We are focused on driving an accelerated recovery to win in the “new normal” by unlocking our full global potential, building on our core strengths and connecting closer to where the consumer is going than any time before, and through which, delivering sustainable, long-term profitable growth and top-tier financial performance through the disciplined execution of the following strategic priorities: 

•Winning with the consumer by gaining a deeper understanding of their choices and positioning our brands to best capture the heart of the consumer, with a focus on our two iconic brands, TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein. 

•Driving the success of our product by focusing on key growth categories across certain lifestyles, and developing the best hero product that the consumer desires, connecting the products closer to where the consumer is going, driving pricing power, and strengthening our commitment to sustainability and circularity. We will continue to maximize assortment productivity by cutting unproductive product styles and evolve our supply chain to adapt more quickly to change, including reducing lead times and improving inventory planning processes to better match the consumer demand. 

•Driving consumer engagement and brand heat through a digital-first 360° approach around key hero products and key consumer moments, and expanding the consumer base and loyalty with a focus on the biggest growth markets, particularly our international markets. 

•Optimizing and maximizing our distribution in the digitally led marketplace, including further driving our digital commerce growth and penetration, optimizing our brick and mortar presence and enhancing the store experience, both in our stores and the stores of our wholesale partners around the world; and continuously strengthening our positioning, channel balance and pricing power. 

•Investing in high-return growth-oriented initiatives, while at the same time driving operating efficiencies through aligning the cost structure to our strategic priorities, becoming more data and demand driven, and better leveraging our global functions to become faster, leaner and simpler – all to connect closer to the consumer.

•Powering brands that drive fashion forward – for good – with sustainability, inclusion and diversity at the core of everything we do.

•Developing a talented and skilled workforce that embodies our core values and an entrepreneurial spirit, focused on continuously learning and improving as we work as one team with one shared vision. 

We believe our long-term strategic priorities focused on driving brand relevance will deliver sustainable, long-term profitable growth and top-tier financial performance, and generate free cash flow to create long-term value. 

 Other Strategic Opportunities 

We manage a portfolio of global iconic brands, including TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein. However, we continue to explore strategic acquisitions of licensed businesses, companies and trademarks, and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business, including product category or platform capability expertise and brand positioning and design perspective needs. We take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, seeking brands with broad consumer recognition that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies.

Seasonality

Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter tends to have the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. The COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain and logistics disruptions have disrupted these patterns, however. We otherwise expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue. Working capital requirements vary throughout the year to support these seasonal patterns and business trends.

Design

Our business depends on our ability to appeal and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality, sustainability and delivering a compelling price value proposition where the consumer is shopping.

Our in-house design teams, together with our merchandising teams, are significant contributors to the continued strength of our brands. Each of our branded businesses employs its own team of designers and merchandisers that are responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the design direction for the brand across the consumer touchpoints of product, stores and marketing. Designers have access to the brands’ extensive archives of product designs, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Our designers collaborate with merchandising teams that analyze sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season's design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Leveraging our strategic investments in data and analytics tools, merchandisers are able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior that empowers our teams to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand, as well as scale opportunities across brands with greater speed and efficiency. Our merchandising teams manage the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. In an effort to keep our brands relevant, our teams also work with other brands and key collaborators to design and merchandise brand collaborations. These collaborations are intended to drive brand heat and product relevance with our target consumers.

Our teams have expanded their use of 3D design technology to enhance our design capabilities, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the need for samples early in the design process and the time needed to bring products to market, and 3D showrooms to enhance the experience of our vendors, while being committed to managing the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. 

Product Sourcing

We have an extensive established network of worldwide sourcing partners that enables us to meet our customers’ needs in an efficient manner without relying on any one vendor or factory or on vendors or factories in any one country. Our products were produced in approximately 1,100 factories in approximately 40 countries during 2021. All of these factories were operated by independent manufacturers, with most located in Asia. 

We source finished products and, to a limited extent, raw materials and trim. Raw materials and trim include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar components. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores. Raw material, trim, and finished product commitments are generally made two to six months prior to production. We believe we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. We believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw materials. 

Our purchases from our suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price, quantity, delivery date and destination of the items to be produced. Sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can be made either to increase or reduce inventories. We look to establish long-term supplier relationships in the appropriate locations throughout the world to meet our needs and we place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk that a production disruption at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem, while seeking to maximize the pricing opportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has had impacts throughout our supply chain, including as a result of vessel, container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally, as well as production delays in some of our key sourcing countries, which has delayed product orders. We have incurred in the second half of 2021 

8 

higher air freight and other logistics costs in connection with these disruptions. We continue to monitor these delays and other potential disruptions in our supply chain and will continue to implement mitigation plans as needed. 

The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety, environmental and cost requirements. Our global supply chain teams, offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers and work with our global compliance teams to ensure the enforcement of our human rights and labor standards and other code of conduct requirements through our ongoing extensive training, approval and monitoring system. They also monitor and track the primary cost inputs to the finished product to ensure that we pay the most appropriate cost for our finished goods. 

We continue to explore new areas of production that can grow with our businesses. Our country of origin strategy provides a flexible approach to product sourcing, which enables us to maximize regional opportunities and mitigate our potential exposure to risks associated with new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, as it has been the case with China, where we have been reducing the amount of production over time in favor of production in other parts of Asia that better serve our sourcing strategy. Many of these efforts have been with our existing partners, but in facilities and countries that offer us production or cost advantages over those in China. 

We also continue to develop strategies that can enhance the operational efficiency of our supply chain and unlock gross margin opportunities. Our teams have expanded their use of 3D design technology to enhance our design capabilities, which has been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, reducing the need for samples early in the design process and the time needed to bring products to market, and 3D showrooms to enhance the experience of our vendors, while being cost and time efficient. Speed is another critical focus area across the Company. We have implemented various speed models, core replenishment and read and react capabilities for select categories to enhance our operations and make our business model more dynamic and responsive, while also increasing service levels, reducing inventory exposure and improving quality and consumer value. We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to control costs better and provide improved service to our customers.

Corporate Responsibility

As an industry leader and one of the largest fashion companies in the world, we recognize that we have a responsibility to address our social and environmental impacts. Corporate responsibility has always played a critical role within our broader business strategy. We are steadfast in our commitment to drive fashion forward – for good – by finding innovative and responsible solutions to protect our planet, cultivating an environment of inclusion, diversity and equity, and improving the lives of women and children where we live and work. 

Forward Fashion is our strategy to transform how clothes are made and (re)used, and the actions we are taking to move our business and the fashion industry toward a more innovative and responsible future. Forward Fashion represents a deepening of our commitment to action and a renewed sense of urgency to use our scale to transform ourselves and the industry. We are committed to the goals outlined in our Forward Fashion strategy and are taking action in a number of ways, including joining key pledges, industry groups and stakeholder initiatives that align with our strategy. Forward Fashion has three focus areas that guide our activities where we can drive the most transformative change across our business:

•Reduce negative impacts — Our ambition is for our products and business operations to generate zero waste, zero carbon emissions and zero hazardous chemicals, and for our products to be circular. This means protecting the global climate by reducing energy use and powering our business through renewable sources, diverting the waste we send to landfills, eliminating water pollution from our wet processors, and fostering and harnessing innovation to design and manufacture products that eliminate product waste.

•Increase positive impacts — Our ambition is for 100% of our products and packaging to be ethically and sustainably sourced from suppliers who respect human rights and are good employers. 

•Improve lives across our value chain — Our ambition is to improve the lives of the over one million people across our value chain, focusing on education and opportunities for women and children, ensuring access to clean water, investing in health and education initiatives, and continuing to champion inclusion and diversity.

9 

Our businesses are an integral part of our Forward Fashion strategy and are equally committed to delivering against our corporate responsibility priorities. 

We issue an annual report on our corporate responsibility efforts that can be found on our corporate website.

Warehousing, Distribution and Logistics

Our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment. Centers range in size, and our main facilities, some of which are owned and operated by independent third parties, are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil and Australia. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our wholesale and digital commerce customers, as well as our retail stores, on a cost-effective basis. 

Material Customers

Our largest customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 15.0% of our revenue in 2021, 16.3% of our revenue in 2020 and 18.4% of our revenue in 2019. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2021, 2020 or 2019.

Advertising and Promotion

Our marketing programs are an integral component of our brands’ relevance and success of the products offered under them. We are focused on driving consumer engagement though a digital-first 360° approach around key hero products and key consumer moments, utilizing our iconic brands as creative platforms for collaborations, capsule collections and experiential events, and partnering with culturally relevant talent to build brand heat. Our initiatives fuse entertainment, pop culture, and digital commerce in innovative ways that digitally immerse consumers. 

We build each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness, relevance and consumer loyalty. We design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers, including sustainability attributes, deliver a strong price/value proposition and encourage consumer loyalty.

Our marketing and advertising efforts encompass marketing, communications, social media and special events. Our in-house teams coordinate our brands’ marketing and advertising, building personalized relationships and tailoring the overall consumer experience for all regions and product lines, and across all channels of distribution. We believe that this enhanced marketing approach enables us to meet our consumers’ needs as we adapt to their rapidly changing demands. 

A significant emphasis of our marketing programs is digital media, including our digital commerce platforms and social media channels, which allow us to expand our consumer reach and enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion in regard to our products, special events, promotions and store locations. Tommy Hilfiger’s digital commerce site, tommy.com, and Calvin Klein’s digital commerce site, calvinklein.com, serve as marketing vehicles to complement the ongoing development of the TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein lifestyle brands, respectively, in addition to offering a broad array of apparel and licensed products. In 2021, a significant portion of our marketing and advertising spend related to digital media.

We leverage new ways to engage consumers through livestreaming fashion shows and other consumer activations and in partnership with top live-streamers and pure play partners, as well as through new innovative and creative ways that engage consumers in the metaverse. In addition, we advertise our brands through sport sponsorships and product tie-ins. We believe that our use of high-profile brand ambassadors and well-known social media influencers helps drive our brand awareness and cultural relevance. We have focused on better aligning regional needs with regional and local ambassadors and influencers to best cater to local market needs and unique activations. Additionally, our marketing and communications team coordinates personal appearances by Mr. Tommy Hilfiger, including at brand events, as part of their efforts. 

Our approach ensures a consistent consumer experience in the digitally led marketplace that is seamlessly connected both online and offline, across all of our digital commerce, retail and wholesale channels.

Trademarks

We own the TOMMY HILFIGER, Calvin Klein, Warner’s, Olga and True&Co. brands, as well as related trademarks (e.g., the TOMMY HILFIGER flag logo and crest design) and lesser-known names. These trademarks are registered for use in each of the primary countries where our products are sold and additional applications for registration of these and other trademarks are made in jurisdictions to accommodate new marks, uses in additional trademark classes or additional categories of goods or expansion into new countries.

Mr. Tommy Hilfiger is prohibited in perpetuity from using, or authorizing others to use, the TOMMY HILFIGER marks (except for the use by Mr. Hilfiger of his name personally and in connection with certain specified activities). In addition, we are prohibited in perpetuity from selling products not ordinarily sold under the names of prestige designer businesses or prestige global lifestyle brands without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, from engaging in new lines of business materially different from such types of lines of business without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, or from disparaging or intentionally tarnishing the TOMMY HILFIGER-related marks or Mr. Hilfiger’s personal name. 

We own the Calvin Klein marks and derivative marks in all trademark classes and for all product categories through our ownership of the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust (the “Trust”), which is the sole and exclusive title owner of substantially all registrations of the Calvin Klein trademarks. The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold these marks. Calvin Klein maintains and protects the marks on behalf of the Trust. The Trust licenses the use of the trademarks to two of our subsidiaries on an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free basis.

Mr. Calvin Klein retains the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in our Calvin Klein business. Mr. Klein has also been granted a royalty-free worldwide right to use the Calvin Klein mark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of the Calvin Klein brands and to avoid competitive conflicts.

Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, as well as licensed product categories and other trademark classes relevant to how we conduct business. We continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets where products bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets and we vigorously seek to protect them on a worldwide basis against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. The TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein brands, in particular, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and their price-positioning provides opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. We have broad, proactive enforcement programs that we believe have been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in our key markets. 

Competition

The apparel industry is competitive as a result of its fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, low barriers to entry, the flow of domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brand owners, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, including, in certain circumstances, the private label brands of our wholesale customers. Additionally, with the shift in consumer shopping preferences driving substantial growth in the digital channel, there are more companies in the apparel sector and an increased level of transparency in pricing and product comparisons, which impacts purchasing decisions. Consumers also are increasingly focused on circularity with respect to apparel and the option from new market players to rent or purchase pre-owned apparel also is impacting purchasing decisions.

We believe we are well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry on the basis of style, quality, price and service. Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demand, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in these areas. Our brands are positioned to sell globally at various price points and in multiple channels of distribution. This enables us to offer differentiated products to a broad range of consumers, reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, product category, price point, distribution channel or region. Our brands generally have long histories and enjoy high 

11 

recognition and awareness within their respective consumer segments. The worldwide recognition of the TOMMY HILFIGER and Calvin Klein brands provides us with significant global opportunities to expand their global penetration in existing markets, into new markets and into additional product categories.

Imports and Import Restrictions

Most of our products are imported into the countries where they are sold. These products are subject to various customs laws, which may impose tariffs, as well as quota restrictions. In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. The United States and other countries in which we sell our products may impose, from time to time, new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, including the imposition of a “safeguard quota,” or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels. We, therefore, continuously monitor import restrictions and developments. We seek to minimize, where appropriate and possible, our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries, including consideration of countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements, and manufacturers, and geographical diversification of our sources of supply. In some instances, production of a specific product category, component parts or raw materials may be highly concentrated in one country, giving us less flexibility to make adjustments.

The United States and China are involved in a trade dispute that saw the imposition in 2019 of significant additional tariffs on the products we sell that are imported into the United States from China. These tariffs remain in place. Additionally, other governmental actions, such as the imposition by U.S. Customs & Border Patrol of Withhold Release Orders (“WROs”) have had, continue to have and, in the future, may have an impact on our ability to import goods. Please see our risk factor “We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for further discussion.

Government Regulations 

Our business is subject to various United States federal, state, and local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites and neighboring properties, or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations and our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position. 

Human Capital Resources

We believe that attracting, developing and retaining diverse talent is critical to our long-term success. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to create a strong associate experience and a diverse and inclusive workplace, with opportunities for our associates to grow and develop in their careers, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our associates and their communities.

The PVH Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight on human capital matters. The Nominating, Governance & Management Development Committee is charged, in part, with monitoring issues of corporate conduct and culture, and provides oversight of diversity, equity and inclusion policies and programs as it relates to our management development, talent assessment and succession planning programs and processes. Our Corporate Responsibility Committee through its charter is responsible for monitoring policies and performance related to corporate responsibility, including social, employment, environmental and other matters. In addition, our Executive Leadership Team is regularly engaged in the development and management of key associate programs and initiatives, guiding our culture, associate experience, and talent development programs.

Associate Information

As of January 30, 2022, we employed approximately 31,000 associates globally, of which approximately 12,000 associates were employed on a part-time basis. Approximately 35% of our associates are employed in the United States. Globally, approximately 63% of our associates are employed in Company-operated retail stores, 31% are assigned to offices and 6% are employed in warehousing and distribution facilities. Our use of seasonal workers is not significant and is largely associated with the Christmas and Lunar New Year selling periods. Approximately 2% of our total associate population is represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by two different unions in the United States. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for three-year terms. In some international markets, a significant percentage of associates are covered by governmental labor arrangements. Additionally, we have one or more works councils in several European countries. Works councils are organizations that represent workers in respect to certain actions management seeks to take that could have a broad effect on the workers. We believe that our relations with our associates are good. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Our culture is grounded in our values. We seek to cultivate an environment of inclusion, equity and belonging for all to build a better workplace, drive innovation in the marketplace and create positive impacts in our communities. 

We believe we benefit from the unique strengths that each of our associates brings to the workplace, and that a diverse workforce is critical to our long-term success. We strive to improve continuously and make PVH an inclusive work environment through diversity recruitment, development programs, and equitable policies and initiatives. One example is our business resource groups (“BRGs”), which are associate-initiated and associate-led groups that foster an inclusive culture and are intended to contribute to the overall success of the business. Our 19 BRGs, which are comprised of associates from traditionally underrepresented groups, allies who support these groups and others who share a common purpose, interest or background, are dedicated to bringing associates together to increase professional and social networks, enhance career development and business acumen, and contribute to building a more inclusive work environment, are supported by our global and regional Inclusion and Diversity (“I&D”) Councils. 

Our Chief Diversity Officer leads the development and implementation of an integrated global I&D strategy and works to enhance our ability to attract, develop, retain and promote diverse talent. The diversity of the Board of Directors continues to be a focus of the Board refreshment program. The five directors who have joined the Board since 2015 include four women and a director who self-identifies as Black and LGBTQIA+. These directors bring with them strong operating and industry experiences, as well as contributing important and diverse perspectives that helps better mirror the overall make-up of our associate and consumer populations. 

Our I&D efforts have been recognized over the years, including being named to Forbes Best Employers for Diversity and America’s Best Employers for Women List in 2020, and as one of America’s 100 Most JUST Companies by Forbes magazine and JUST Capital in 2021. We also received a score of 100% on the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index in 2022, for the sixth year in a row and we were honored with the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Award in 2020. We also ranked ninth on the Fortune Measure Up list of 20 progressive companies in diversity and inclusion in 2021. 

Talent Management and Development 

Our talent management and development processes support associate performance and development, talent reviews and succession planning. We regularly review succession plans and conduct assessments to identify talent needs and growth paths for our associates.

13 

Developing our associates is a key strategic priority for us, with the focus on developing leaders and preparing the workforce for the future. PVH University, our global internal learning and development platform, provides tools and learning opportunities that empower associates to build core competencies and develop skills necessary for improvement and advancement through engaging and impactful learning content. PVH University programs include, among other things, academies for leadership and a Leaders as Teachers program in which our associates instruct on topics in their area of expertise, and our Leadership Behaviors offerings, which are bespoke programs designed to build leadership capabilities for all associates to support our culture and deliver our business strategy. The PVH University library and curriculum includes its digital academy to build enterprise digital and data literacy, as well as to support digital transformation initiatives, and its functional academy to support functional skill building. Additionally, our approach to performance and development is designed to motivate our associates to develop, leverage their strengths and support a coaching and feedback culture.

Compensation, Benefits and Wellness 

We are committed to providing market competitive compensation and benefits, tailoring our offerings to the countries and regions where our associates work to best position our programs locally while recognizing differing levels and types of government-provided benefits. These benefits include, among other things, a corporate wellness program, retirement plan benefits, flexible working arrangements, an employee assistance program, paid parental leave, recognition programs (for exemplary work, work anniversaries, etc.) and an associate discount program.

On wellness, we have undertaken initiatives such as closing our offices worldwide in respect of World Mental Health Day. In the United States for our office employees, we added a “Be You Day” to our paid days off, which is a self-designated day off for use as each individual decides, and have designated two hours during the third Wednesday of every month as a “You Matter Moment,” when calendars are blocked for associates to take PVH University courses, exercise or do whatever type of self-improvement or rest they desire.

On compensation, we are committed to achieving pay equity and have developed consistent guidelines and practices on compensation, and in 2021 we engaged third party experts to conduct a global study of gender and ethnicity pay equity.

We also seek to support our associates in times of need. We have established through The PVH Foundation, our philanthropic organization, a Company- and associate-funded Associate Relief Fund that provides grants to eligible associates experiencing personal hardship due to natural disasters, personal calamities and other events.

The health and safety of our associates is of utmost importance to us. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our associates, as well as the communities in which we operate. This included implementing measures to support high safety standards in our retail stores, offices and distribution centers, including temporary closures, remote working, reduced occupancy levels, social-distancing, sanitation measures and the distribution of re-usable three-layer cloth masks. To protect our associates, their families and our communities, we strongly encourage our associates to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and be boosted, when eligible. We follow federal, state and local government vaccination requirements, provide resources and support to help employees get vaccinated, and offer paid time off for primary and booster vaccinations. The vast majority of our office-based associates continued to work remotely for the majority of 2021 and we have commenced a phased approach to returning our office-based associates onsite. This includes modifications to certain of our existing office locations as we adapt to a hybrid work environment that provides flexibility, while maintaining our strong culture of collaboration and connection, in addition to a safe working environment for our associates. We will continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and gather additional feedback during the reopening of our offices to ensure the continued health, safety and wellness of our associates working onsite. 

Associate and Community Engagement 

We believe it is critical that our associates are informed and engaged. We communicate frequently with our associates through a variety of methods, including our news app, PVH Insider, which reaches associates around the world; our intranet site, the Thread; town hall meetings on regional, business-wide and global bases; and our bi-annual global PVH Listens survey, as well as regional pulse associate surveys. We develop action plans based on the insights from these communications to strengthen programs and address any concerns to enhance associate experience. 

Local community engagement activities exist in all major office locations. Our global philanthropic efforts are led by The PVH Foundation, a nonprofit corporation which supports global, national, and local nonprofits in communities where our associates work and live. PVH’s matching gift program allows our associates to have their philanthropic donations to qualifying 

14 

organizations matched by The PVH Foundation to increase their impact. Associates are also offered paid time off each year to volunteer with organizations of their choice. 

We encourage you to read our annual Corporate Responsibility Report on our PVH.com corporate website for more detailed information regarding our environmental, social and corporate governance programs and initiatives. None of our corporate website, our Corporate Responsibility Report nor any portions thereof are incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
