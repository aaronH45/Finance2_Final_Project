OVERVIEW

H&R Block provides help and inspires confidence in its clients and communities everywhere through global tax preparation services, financial products, and small business solutions. We blend digital innovation with human expertise and care to help people get the best outcome at tax time and also be better with money by using our mobile banking app, Spruce℠. Through Block Advisors® and Wave®, we help small business owners thrive with innovative products like Wave Money®, a mobile-first, small-business bank account that manages bookkeeping automatically.

H&R Block, Inc. was organized as a corporation in 1955 under the laws of the State of Missouri. A complete list of our subsidiaries as of June 30, 2022 can be found in Exhibit 21.

The Spruce℠ platform, built by H&R Block with banking products powered by Pathward, includes a spending account with a debit card, along with a connected savings account that allows for budgeting for specific goals, and other features to help customers be good with money.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT INDUSTRY SEGMENTS

We report a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations, which includes tax preparation, small business services, and financial services and products. See discussion below.

During fiscal year 2021, we introduced Block Horizons, our five year strategy that will leverage our human expertise and technological infrastructure to deliver growth by driving tax solution innovation, helping small businesses to thrive, and support individuals where they need the most help with money.

Small Business

We are focused on growing our base of tax customers by leveraging the Block Advisors® brand and serving more entrepreneurs through our Wave® platform. In small business, our strong marketing and more advanced tax pro training allowed us to grow our assisted tax clients and our net average charge as we serve more complex businesses. In Wave, we have been successful in attracting new clients and increasing the value of existing clients, as both average revenue per user and average invoicing volume saw accelerating growth trends year over year. 

Financial Products

In January 2022, we launched our new mobile banking platform, SpruceSM. We believe there is an opportunity to combine leading technology and features with our trusted brand and established financial relationships. Throughout the year we tested multiple iterations of our sign-up offer and continued to release updates to improve the product. We introduced clients to SpruceSM only in the DIY channel at launch to learn and gain customer insights. During the next fiscal year, we will test customer acquisition outside the tax season and prepare for launch in the Assisted channel.

Block Experience

The Block Experience is all about blending technology and digital tools with human expertise. We have been successful in driving digital adoption by leveraging MyBlock features, such as uploading documents, approving returns online, and utilizing virtual chat. We are gaining traction as virtual uptake from our clients more than tripled in the current year. 

We provide assisted and do-it-yourself (DIY) tax return preparation solutions through multiple channels (including in-person, online and mobile applications, virtual, and desktop software) and distribute H&R Block-branded services and products, including those of our bank partners, to the general public primarily in the U.S., Canada and Australia. We also offer small business financial solutions through our company-owned and franchise offices and online through Wave. Major revenue sources include fees earned for tax preparation via our assisted and DIY channels, royalties from franchisees, and fees from related services and products. 

TAX PREPARATION SERVICES

Assisted income tax return preparation and related services are provided by tax professionals via a system of retail offices operated directly by us or our franchisees. These tax professionals provide assistance to our clients either in person or virtually in a number of ways. Clients can come into an office, digitally "drop off" their documents for their tax professional, approve their return online, have a tax professional review a return they prepared themselves through Tax Pro Review or get their questions answered as they complete their own return through Online Assist. 

H&R Block, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K3

Our online software may be accessed through our website at www.hrblock.com or in a mobile application, while our desktop software may be purchased online and through third-party retail stores.

Assisted tax returns are covered by our 100% accuracy guarantee, whereby we will reimburse a client for penalties and interest attributable to an H&R Block error on a tax return. DIY tax returns are covered by our 100% accuracy guarantee, whereby we will reimburse a client up to a maximum of $10,000 if our software makes an arithmetic error that results in payment of penalties and/or interest to the IRS that the client would otherwise not have been required to pay.

We offer franchises as a way to expand our presence in certain geographic areas. In the U.S., our franchisees pay us approximately 30% of gross tax return preparation and related service revenues as a franchise royalty.

OTHER OFFERINGS

We also offer U.S. clients a number of additional services, including Refund Transfers (RT), our Peace of Mind® Extended Service Plan (POM), H&R Block Emerald Prepaid Mastercard® (Emerald Card®), Emerald Advances (EA), Tax Identity Shield® (TIS), Refund Advances (RA), and small business financial solutions. For our Canadian clients, we also offer POM, H&R Block's Instant RefundSM, H&R Block Pay With Refund®, and small business financial solutions.

Refund Transfers. RTs enable clients to receive their tax refunds by their chosen method of disbursement and include a feature enabling clients to deduct tax preparation and related fees from their tax refunds. Depending on circumstances, clients may choose to receive their RT proceeds by a load to their Emerald Card, a deposit to their Spruce Spending Account, by receiving a check or by direct deposit to an existing account. RTs are available to U.S. clients and are frequently obtained by those who: (1) do not have bank accounts into which the IRS can direct deposit their refunds; (2) like the convenience and benefits of a temporary account for receipt of their refund; and/or (3) prefer to have their tax preparation fees paid directly out of their refunds. RTs are offered through our relationship with our bank partner. We offer a similar program, H&R Block Pay With Refund®, to our Canadian clients through a Canadian chartered bank.

Peace of Mind® Extended Service Plan. We offer POM to U.S. and Canadian clients who obtain assisted tax preparation services, whereby we (1) represent our clients if they are audited by a taxing authority, and (2) assume the cost, subject to certain limits, of additional taxes owed by a client resulting from errors attributable to H&R Block. The additional taxes paid under POM have a cumulative limit of $6,000 for U.S. clients and $3,000 CAD for Canadian clients with respect to the federal, state/provincial and local tax returns we prepared for applicable clients during the taxable year protected by POM.

H&R Block Emerald Prepaid Mastercard®. The Emerald Card® enables clients to receive their tax refunds from the IRS directly on a prepaid debit card, or to direct RT, EA or RA proceeds to the card. The card can be used for everyday purchases, bill payments and ATM withdrawals anywhere Debit Mastercard® (Mastercard is a registered trademark of Mastercard International Incorporated) is accepted. Additional funds can be added to the card year-round, such as through direct deposit or at participating retail reload providers, and the Emerald Card can be added to clients' mobile wallets. We distribute the Emerald Card® issued by our bank partner.

H&R Block Emerald Advance® Lines of Credit. EAs are lines of credit offered to clients in our offices, from mid-November through mid-January, in amounts up to $1,000. If the borrower meets certain criteria as agreed in the loan terms, the line of credit can be utilized year-round. In addition to the required monthly payments, borrowers may elect to pay down balances on EAs with their tax refunds. These lines of credit are offered by our bank partner, and we subsequently purchase a participation interest in all EAs originated by our bank partner.

Tax Identity Shield®. Our TIS program offers clients assistance in helping protect their tax identity and access to services to help restore their tax identity, and if necessary, access to services to help restore their tax identity. Protection services include a daily scan of the dark web for personal information, a monthly scan for the client's social security number in credit header data, notifying clients if their information is detected on a tax return filed through H&R Block, and obtaining additional IRS identity protections when eligible.

Refund Advance Loans. RAs are interest-free loans offered by our bank partner, which are available to eligible U.S. assisted clients in company-owned and participating franchise locations, including virtual clients. In tax season 

42022 Form 10-K | H&R Block, Inc.

2022, RAs were offered in amounts of $250, $500, $750, $1,250 and $3,500, based on client eligibility as determined by our bank partner. 

H&R Block's Instant RefundSM. Our Canadian operations advance refunds due to certain clients from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), for a fee. The fee charged for this service is mandated by federal legislation which is administered by the CRA. The client assigns to us the full amount of the tax refund to be issued by the CRA and the refund amount is then sent by the CRA directly to us. 

Small Business Financial Solutions. Our Block Advisor certified tax professionals provide small businesses with financial expertise in taxes, bookkeeping and payroll through our office network. Wave provides small business owners with an online solution to manage their finances, including payment processing, payroll and bookkeeping services.

SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS 

Because the majority of our clients file their tax returns during the period from February through April in a typical year, a substantial majority of our revenues from income tax return preparation and related services and products are earned during this period. As a result, we generally operate at a loss through the first two quarters of our fiscal year. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and a delayed federal tax filing deadline in the prior year, there has been a shift in the typical seasonality of our business and the comparability of our financial results.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS 

We provide assisted and DIY tax preparation services and products, as well as small business financial solutions, and face substantial competition in and across each category from tax return preparation firms and software providers, accounting firms, independent tax preparers, and certified public accountants.

We are one of the largest providers of tax return preparation solutions and electronic filing services in the U.S., Canada, and Australia with 23.6 million returns filed by or through H&R Block in fiscal year 2022 via 10,488 tax offices and our virtual tax preparation services, mobile applications, and online and desktop DIY solutions.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

Our business is subject to various forms of government regulation, including U.S. Federal and state tax preparer regulations, financial consumer protection and privacy regulations, state regulations, franchise regulations and foreign regulations. See further discussion of these items in our Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 7 under "Regulatory Environment" of this Form 10-K.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Fulfilling our purpose extends to helping and inspiring confidence in our associates. We are committed to our associates’ total well-being—physical, mental, financial, career, team and community. Together, when we balance these components, we achieve personal, team and organizational strength. These commitments extend to both our year-round and seasonal associates.

Associates. We had approximately 3,800 regular full-time associates as of June 30, 2022. Our business is dependent on the availability of a seasonal workforce, including tax professionals, and our ability to hire, train, and supervise these associates. The highest number of persons we employed during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, including seasonal associates, was approximately 69,900.

Associate Engagement. We administer an annual survey to all associates to better understand their levels of engagement and identify areas where we can improve. We are pleased with our overall engagement score, meeting or exceeding the global benchmark in all measured categories, and will continue to explore new ways to advance our engagement efforts in the future.

Compensation and Benefits. Our compensation programs are designed to attract and retain top talent that act boldly, demand high standards, crave tough problems and value winning as a team. Our equitable and comprehensive benefits offerings provide access to benefits to help both regular and seasonal associates plan for the health and security of their families. H&R Block provides comprehensive medical insurance to our associates, 

H&R Block, Inc. | 2022 Form 10-K5

and extends the opportunity for medical insurance to our seasonal workforce who satisfy the eligibility guidelines of the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Subject to meeting eligibility requirements, associates can also choose to participate in the H&R Block Retirement Savings Plan 401(k) and Employee Stock Purchase Plan.

Training and Development. We offer a variety of development opportunities for our associates, including in-person classes, online courses, assessments, and a learning library. Our tax professionals receive extensive annual tax training on topics including recent tax code changes and filing practices, and we offer additional education opportunities for tax professionals to enhance their knowledge and skills. In preparation for the upcoming tax season, our tax professionals receive training on H&R Block products, soft skills and tax office best practices. Each year, our tax professionals receive on average over 30 hours of Tax Education and over 16 hours of Continuing Professional Education.

Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. We continually evaluate our management approaches to improving diversity and inclusion, which includes looking at how we can provide a sense of belonging in the workplace for our associates. We materialized these efforts through our Belonging@Block program which is a council of associates from multiple departments across the organization with the responsibility to represent and improve our diverse and inclusive culture. Because of our efforts to foster a culture of belonging, we are consistently recognized as a top employer in many different categories.

SERVICE MARKS AND TRADEMARKS

We have made a practice of offering our services and products under service marks and trademarks and of securing registration for many of these marks in the U.S. and other countries where our services and products are marketed. We consider these service marks and trademarks, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to our business, particularly our businesses providing services and products under the "H&R Block" brand. The initial duration of U.S. federal trademark registrations is 10 years. Most U.S. federal registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals and remain enforceable so long as the marks continue to be used.
