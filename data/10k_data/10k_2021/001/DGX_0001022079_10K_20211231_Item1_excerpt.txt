INTRODUCTION

 Quest Diagnostics Incorporated is the world's leading provider of diagnostic information services. We play a crucial role in the healthcare ecosystem, empowering people to take action to improve health outcomes. Derived from the world's largest database of clinical lab results, our diagnostic insights reveal new avenues to identify and treat disease, inspire healthy behaviors and improve healthcare management. In the right hands and with the right context, our diagnostic insights can inspire actions that transform lives.

 Quest Diagnostics was incorporated in Delaware in 1990; its predecessor companies date back to 1967. We conduct business through our headquarters in Secaucus, New Jersey, and our laboratories, patient service centers, offices and other facilities around the United States and in selected locations outside the United States. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Quest Diagnostics,” the “Company,” “we” and “our” mean Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries.

 The patients we serve comprise approximately one-third of the adult population of the United States annually, and approximately one-half of the adult population in the United States over a three-year period. We estimate that annually we serve approximately half of the physicians and half of the hospitals in the United States. 

 During 2021, we generated net revenues of $10.8 billion. Additional financial information concerning Quest Diagnostics for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is included in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in Part II, Item 8.

 Our vision, aspirational goals and values are set forth below.

 We believe that our vision, aspirational goals and strategy align very well with, and our strong value proposition supports, the triple aim of healthcare: improving medical quality and the patient experience while reducing the cost of care.

 Quest Diagnostics is at the forefront of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, playing a pivotal role to broaden access to laboratory insights to help people lead healthier and safer lives. We provide both molecular diagnostic and antibody serology tests to aid in the diagnosis of COVID-19 and the detection of immune response to the virus, and have performed approximately 63 million of these tests. We have built up and maintain the testing capacity to handle surges in COVID-19 testing demands, including using our national courier, air fleet and logistics network to balance volume across approximately two dozen COVID-19 testing laboratories, and also through our laboratory referral partner program. We are working with federal, state and local governments, healthcare organizations, payers, suppliers, retailers, trade associations and other laboratories in the effort to bring as much COVID-19 testing as possible to the American people. We are also providing data on COVID-19 testing that we conduct to federal, state and local public health authorities, including the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and participate in studies with government and private institutions, aiding COVID-19 public health response and research. All of our employees, including our dedicated laboratory professionals, phlebotomists, air fleet team, and couriers take tremendous pride in the role we play and work tirelessly to help patients and communities access quality COVID-19 testing. 

 We have seen how underserved communities are being disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 with tragic consequences. With the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, we launched Quest for Health Equity, an initiative to reduce health disparities in underserved communities in the U.S. This initiative is providing a combination of testing services, education programs, alliances and financial support to efforts to address health disparities. Since its inception, we have launched over 25 programs across the U.S. and Puerto Rico, including supporting COVID-19 testing and vaccination events, educating young students on healthy nutrition choices and expanding research and mentorship opportunities for black and Hispanic scholars. 

 Our approach to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic has been rooted in our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights. We believe that the challenges we are facing from the COVID-19 pandemic have brought us together, made us a stronger company and will help us capture the substantial opportunities in front of us. 

OUR STRATEGY 

 We have a two-point business strategy, reviewed by our Board of Directors, to achieve our vision and our goals.

Approaches to Accelerate Growth (Table 2)

1. Delivering annual revenue growth of more than 2% through accretive, strategic acquisitions

Plus organic growth through:

2. Capitalizing on increased health plan access 

3. Increasing share with IDNs 

4. Growing Advanced Diagnostics 

5. Building consumer-initiated testing

 1. Growing through acquisitions. We endeavor to grow revenue each year by more than 2% through accretive, strategic acquisitions (our target is based on our revenues excluding the revenues from our COVID -19 testing). Acquisition opportunities may include IDN outreach businesses, regional laboratory consolidation and businesses that will provide us with new capabilities. Our approach to acquisitions, and the key acquisitions we consummated during 2021, are discussed below under the heading Deliver disciplined capital deployment.  

 2. Capitalizing on increased health plan access. We are focused on opportunities to partner with health plans. We strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by focusing on driving value and providing strong value propositions for members and clinicians. This includes working with payers to reduce the cost of care, improve the customer experience and drive better outcomes for populations. For example, we strive to build information platforms to help health plans manage utilization and population health, keep laboratory testing in network and provide an alternative to high-cost labs. We also offer extended care services to help close gaps in care designed to be attractive to payers, for example through our Quest HealthConnect offerings. In 2021, we made progress with value-based programs with UnitedHealthcare and broadened redirection and network leakage efforts with Anthem. We also renewed our longstanding 

4 

Table of Contents 

relationships with Aetna (remaining a preferred laboratory provider and partner in Aetna's network) and EmblemHealth (one of the nation's largest non-profit health insurers). In addition, we expanded access, including with Highmark Delaware and other plans. 

 3. Increasing share with IDNs. We believe that the growing market challenges faced by IDNs, including continued consolidation, price transparency, cost and utilization pressure, evolving healthcare payment models, capital needs, changing technology and limited resources, provide us with an opportunity to partner with them more effectively as they consider their laboratory testing strategy and drive demand for our expertise. We have deployed a dedicated team to strengthen our relationships with IDNs, including with respect to their reference testing. We target three specific segments: reference testing, outreach testing and lab management. We provide reference testing for approximately half of the hospitals in the U.S. and are a leading provider of this testing in the country. Our industry-leading Professional Laboratory Services, highlighted in Table 3, provides a suite of solutions to help IDNs build and execute their laboratory strategy, improve quality, reduce the cost of care and focus on core competencies. We purchase outreach testing businesses from IDNs that decide to exit that business. In 2021, we recorded our highest level of Professional Laboratory Services revenues to date and, as discussed below under the heading Deliver disciplined capital deployment, acquired the outreach testing business of Mercy.

 4. Growing Advanced Diagnostics. We are a leading provider of Advanced Diagnostics, with an array of offerings across the spectrum. We aim to accelerate the growth of our Advanced Diagnostics offerings to a growth rate of at least 8% per year. We have been investing in our Advanced Diagnostics offerings, including to enhance our innovation capabilities and to strengthen our service offering and sales force, to make our Advanced Diagnostics offerings more attractive and accessible to IDNs and clinicians. In addition, we have invested in reducing the cost of next-generation sequencing and combining that with the power of our Blueprint Genetics® data analytics capabilities. We are seeking to apply the capabilities gained by these efforts to other areas where we can make a meaningful difference in health care, including consumer genetics and offerings to pharmaceutical companies, IDNs and health plans. In 2021, we expanded our offerings with the addition of Biocept Inc.'s liquid biopsy test for non-small cell lung cancer. We also saw strong growth in non-invasive prenatal testing and a solid contribution in specialty genetics from Blueprint Genetics. 

 5. Building consumer-initiated testing. For many years, we have been focused on the consumer, and have taken strong steps to be recognized as the consumer-friendly provider of choice of diagnostic information services. Our strong consumer focus is highlighted in Table 4. We will continue to focus on improving the consumer experience, including through improved digitization and other enhancements of our operations. For example, in 2021 we improved the functionality of our MyQuest® app, taking into account consumer feedback. 

Increasing consumer expectations inform our design for our consumer experience.

We are guided by a service dashboard that focuses throughout our operations on quality for consumers, healthcare providers and employees, including medical quality, on-time delivery, competitive costs and employee safety. 

 During 2021, we made strong progress on our improvement initiatives. We completed the consolidation and integration of Northeast U.S. regional operations into our new 250,000 square foot, highly automated, flagship laboratory in Clifton, New Jersey. We also commenced consolidation of our urinalysis testing onto a new highly automated platform that we expect will generate substantial savings once implemented. We are taking advantage of robotic process automation technologies. In addition, we also increased patient use of appointment scheduling, reduced payor denials and improved patient collection at the time of service. We also are seeing increased patient and physician acceptance of the digitization of our service offerings, with more self-service options and a greater percentage of our volume moving to digital, paperless transactions. 

 Our cost excellence program, Invigorate, includes structured plans to drive savings and improve productivity across the value chain, including in such areas as revenue services, information technology and procurement. We currently aim annually to achieve savings and productivity improvements of 3% of our costs. In 2021, we exceeded our goal. 

OUR STRENGTHS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Quality 

 Our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality. We strive to accomplish that through commitment, leadership, and establishing rigorous processes which we measure and continually seek to improve, and by using the Quest Management System, which provides best-in-class business performance tools to create and implement effective and sustainable quality processes. The Quest Diagnostics Quality Program includes policies and procedures to document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of our laboratory operations in providing and improving quality and meeting applicable regulatory requirements. The Quality Program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to deliver superior quality care, identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems. To help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry, we have implemented our Quality System Framework, which serves as a reference

Table of Contents 

guide for our employees and describes our Quality System Elements, which provide the structure for each laboratory to achieve and maintain quality processes. We also have a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to ensure we have a high-quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectations across that network. Being chosen by UnitedHealthcare as a participant in the UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network reflects the strength of our quality. For additional information about our commitment to quality, see "General - Quality Assurance" on page 25.

 Strong operating principles 

 We have a foundation of three strong operating principles: 

•strengthen organizational capabilities; 

•remain focused on diagnostic information services; and 

•deliver disciplined capital deployment.

 Strengthen organizational capabilities. We continuously strive to strengthen our organizational capabilities to support our two-point strategy, enable growth and productivity, better focus on our customers, speed decision-making and empower employees. Highlights include:

•Align for Growth, Execution and Efficiency. Our organization is designed to align around future growth opportunities, coordinate business units for seamless execution and leverage our company-wide infrastructure to gain more capability, value and efficiency. We relied on this organizational design to allow us to develop a coordinated and sustained strategy to respond to the unprecedented challenges we face responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. The value creation side of our business includes product and commercial marketing and is organized by clinical franchise and focuses on customer solutions for the marketplace, including new test development and diagnostic insights. The value delivery side includes sales, laboratory operations, field operations, logistics and client services. 

•Quest Management System. This system provides a foundation for day-to-day management, and includes best-in-class business performance tools to help develop new capabilities to improve our Company. The system enables us to run the Company with a common language, approach and philosophy, and supports our efforts to maintain a high-performance culture, with employees focused on behaviors to foster our agility, transparency, customer focus, collaboration and performance orientation. 

 Remain focused on diagnostic information services.  We maintain a sharp focus on providing diagnostic information services. During 2021, we sold to IQVIA Holdings Inc. our 40% minority stake in Q2 Solutions,® our clinical trials central laboratory services joint venture, and in connection with the sale we entered a multi-year agreement to continue to support Q2 Solutions as its strategic preferred laboratory partner. 

 Deliver disciplined capital deployment. Our disciplined capital deployment framework includes investment in our business, dividends and share repurchases. The framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating. We expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with that expectation, in February 2022 we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock cash dividend by approximately 6.5%, from $0.62 per common share to $0.66 per common share. This represents our eleventh increase in the dividend since 2011. For many years, we have maintained a common stock repurchase program. Since the beginning of 2013, we have returned approximately $5.7 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock. Our share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures in each of the last three years are presented in our consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report). 

 The Company's strategy includes generating growth through value-creating, strategically-aligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria. We screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations, including value creation, return on invested capital and impact on our earnings. In 2021, we consummated the acquisition of the outreach laboratory services business of Mercy, one of the most highly-integrated, multi-state health care systems, with operations serving providers and patients in Arkansas, Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. We also acquired assets of Labtech Diagnostics LLC, an independent clinical laboratory serving physicians and patients primarily in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia and Florida, and a couple of other small independent regional labs. Our significant acquisitions in each of the last three years are further discussed in Note 5 to the audited consolidated financial statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Report).

 We seek innovations and solutions that help healthcare providers, IDNs, health plans and other healthcare market participants care for their patients through better testing for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices, and that deliver high clinical value to the medical community and reduce the overall cost of healthcare. Starting with a clinical focus on a specific disease state or clinical problem, we take advantage of advanced technology for more precise, comprehensive and actionable information. We seek to develop innovations and solutions that help to determine a patient's genotype or gene expression profile relative to a particular disease and its potential therapies, because they can help healthcare providers to determine a patient's susceptibility to disease or to tailor medical care to an individual's needs. This would include determining if a medication might be an optimum choice for a particular person, or tailoring the right dosage once the proper medicine is prescribed. We endeavor to improve test processes, including through increased automation. In addition, we aim to develop holistic solutions responsive to challenges that healthcare providers and patients face, by developing solutions of tests, information and services focused on specific clinical challenges, and taking advantage of the latest healthcare data capabilities. We also look for innovations and solutions that are less invasive than currently available options, and to increase the choices that healthcare providers and patients have for the collection of diagnostic samples. We seek innovation in the ways we bring solutions to customers, and in the customer experience, including enhanced services and end-to-end solutions for convenience and support. We make innovative solutions available to community physicians through our connectivity solutions, operational footprint and by making complex results actionable. We plan to expand our innovative solutions through research and development, as well as partnerships with academic institutions, other technology and healthcare leaders and public health agencies.

 Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have secured an Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA for pooled specimen testing in connection with molecular diagnostic COVID-19 testing. With government and private sector partners, we developed and built "pop-up" COVID-19 testing sites that offered a new, efficient model for consumer access to testing at a critical time. During 2021, we introduced a new COVID-19 semi-quantitative serology test service that aids in providing insight into an individual's immune response as a result of a recent or prior infection with SARS-CoV-2, including assessing blood levels of antibodies. In addition, we licensed the patented ceramide-analysis technology of Zora Biosciences Oy and announced plans to develop, and offer through our Cardiometabolic Center of Excellence at Cleveland Heartlab, a test service as an aid in identifying patients at risk for cardiovascular-related disease and death. These initiatives, along with other developments highlighted below under the headings "Collaboration," Medical and Scientific Expertise," and "Healthcare Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets," demonstrate our agility and strength in innovation.

 Collaboration 

 We believe that strategic relationships, including with healthcare providers, public health authorities, consumer-focused entities and others, can position us for growth at the center of healthcare and that healthcare companies that can partner effectively with others will be successful in the long term. We collaborate with partners that can help us to achieve our vision of empowering better health through diagnostic insights and have relationships across the spectrum of healthcare, including with world class healthcare and consumer-focused leaders, to foster important advances in healthcare, including in precision medicine and healthcare delivery. We plan to continue to pursue strategic relationships to help accelerate growth and drive operational excellence. In 2021, we announced our collaboration with Paige to unlock the potential of artificial intelligence to improve and speed the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases that rely on pathologic assessment. We also collaborated with CIC Health, Ginko Bioworks and Battelle Memorial Institute to develop solutions to make testing easy, fast and affordable for school systems and other group settings (e.g., the travel and entertainment industry) across the country.

Our role at the forefront of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated this strength. We have secured over 20 Emergency Use Authorizations from the FDA for innovations in connection with COVID-19 testing and specimen collection, including regarding unobserved nasal specimen self-collection, combined COVID-19 and respiratory virus tests, COVID-19 at-home specimen collection by consumers, and methods to increase testing capacity and expand the testing supply base. In addition to a Health Trends® report on children in the U.S. with detectable levels of lead in their blood, we published numerous Health Trends® reports on COVID-19, including during 2021 additional reports addressing the "hidden pandemic": signs of addiction missed during the pandemic; the sharp decline in cancer diagnoses during the first year of the pandemic; decreases in hepatitis C testing and treatment during the first months of the pandemic; and Blacks and Hispanic/Latinx less confident in their ability to access COVID-19 vaccines, treatment and healthcare than white Americans. We also expanded our engagement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to provide genomic sequencing of emerging COVID-19 variants, to aid public health response to COVID-19.

  Health Information Technology Solutions and Information Assets 

 We have a history of providing leading information technology for diagnostic information services, including for patients, clinicians and healthcare organizations. We were the first national diagnostic information services provider to offer online patient appointment scheduling and a patient connectivity solution.

Diagnostic Information Services 

 Background - clinical testing. Clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services. Clinical testing is used for predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices of diseases and other medical conditions. Clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services. Anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients. 

 Clinical laboratory testing, which can be characterized as routine, non-routine or advanced, generally is performed on whole blood, serum, plasma and other body fluids, such as urine, and specimens such as microbiology samples. Clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine. Routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs. Commonly ordered routine tests include blood chemistries, urinalysis, allergy tests and complete blood cell counts. Non-routine tests may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated data analysis, technology, equipment or materials, may be performed less frequently than routine tests and may be reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests. It may not be practical, from a cost-effectiveness or infrastructure perspective, for many IDNs, ACOs, DCEs, commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of non-routine tests, or to perform low-volume non-routine testing in-house. Such tests generally are outsourced to a clinical testing laboratory which can perform these non-routine tests. Some non-routine tests are advanced. Advanced tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics (including next-generation sequencing), oncology, neurology, companion diagnostics and non-invasive pre-natal and other germline genetic testing.

THE CLINICAL TESTING INDUSTRY

Key Trends

 The healthcare system in the United States is evolving; significant change is taking place in the system. We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry, including impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which include the increased adoption of telemedicine, will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive. There are a number of key trends that are having, and that we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business. These trends, discussed in the table below, present both opportunities and risks. We believe that several of the trends, including consolidation, price transparency and consumerization, are favorable to our business. 

 Because diagnostic information services is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term. In addition, we believe that the clinical testing market continued with fundamental changes in 2021. First, we believe that PAMA-driven reimbursement pressure is a catalyst for structural change in the market. Second, we believe that health plans increasingly are focusing on driving better value in laboratory testing services. Third, we believe that ongoing consumerization in healthcare, with increased cost being borne by consumers, is changing consumption of healthcare services. We believe that these changing market fundamentals will benefit lower-cost, high-value providers like Quest and that we are well positioned to grow from the changing market conditions and benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.

Key Trends (Table 11)

PAMA-driven reimbursement pressurePursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced during 2018 - 2020. PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement rate reduction from 2023-25 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually. 

PAMA's next data collection and reporting period have been delayed, most recently by federal legislation adopted in December 2021, which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until January 1, 2023.

The American Clinical Laboratory Association, of which the Company is a member, initiated a lawsuit charging that in implementing PAMA, CMS failed to follow a Congressional directive to implement a market-based laboratory payment system. The lawsuit is pending. 

Health plans driving value in lab spending

IDNs, which provide outreach testing and may encourage clinicians to send their outreach testing volume to the IDN's laboratory, historically were able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable services. In addition, health plans generally reimburse non-participating laboratory testing providers at higher out-of-network rates. We are finding increased interest among health plans in driving better value in spending for laboratory testing. Health plans increasingly are taking steps to encourage the movement of testing volume to high value, lower cost providers like our Company, including by identifying preferred provider partners, plan design changes (e.g., zero-dollar out-of-pocket costs for members using preferred providers) and better aligning reimbursement rates for IDN-based providers and independent commercial laboratories. The UnitedHealthcare Preferred Lab Network, which chose us to participate, is a recent example of a health plan taking these steps.

Health plans also are increasingly adopting policies, practices and procedures based on requirements imposed by government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid in order to influence the utilization and reimbursement of testing services. These policies, practices and procedures are subject to change without notice.

Table of Contents 

ConsumerizationConsumers are our customers. Increasingly, consumers are engaged and interested in, and empowered to manage and take direct responsibility for, their own healthcare. As a result, they are more sophisticated in their understanding of their healthcare needs and their expectations of healthcare providers. Some consumers are interested in selecting their own diagnostics tests, rather than relying upon a healthcare professional to select the tests. In addition, consumers often are bearing increased financial responsibility for their healthcare (e.g., high deductible health plans; rising deductibles). In our experience, consumers are more focused on transparency, ease of doing business and understanding diagnostics information services than they have been in the past. Consumers increasingly are demanding convenience; a superior and personalized experience relevant to their needs; and to be empowered to make their own healthcare decisions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing consumers increase their use of telemedicine capabilities, increase their responsibility for their own healthcare (e.g., increased consumer-initiated testing; increased specimen self-collection) and increase their openness to new delivery channels (e.g., retail; convenient "pop-up" test centers). In addition, consumers are seeking prompt, direct access to their test results. Increasingly, consumers are motivated to find high quality service providers with strong digital experience delivery engines, accessible customer service and lower prices, like our Company.

Prevention and wellnessWe believe that the value of detection, prevention, wellness and personalized care is well recognized. Government agencies and other customers discussed in table 13 increasingly focus on helping the healthy stay healthy, detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventive insight and care that helps avoid disease. 

Medical innovation

Medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases. 

Continuing advances in genomics and proteomics are expected to yield new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests. These advances also are spurring interest in and demand for precision medicine, which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing and in which data information services and strategies are used to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals. 

Pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumor-specific genetic markers. 

Demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients, payers and healthcare providers by improving clinical decision support and access to patient data, and by increasing patient participation in care management and population health management. 

Innovation also includes making healthcare services, including laboratory testing services, more convenient for populations and consumers to access, including at home (e.g., telehealth) or in retail settings.

There is increasing focus on access to patient data and data-driven insights.

Healthcare industry evolution

Customers discussed in table 13 and other healthcare system participants have been consolidating, converging and diversifying. For example, a number of IDNs are considering establishing or have established health insurance plans, and health insurance providers are considering providing or are providing healthcare services. In recent years, a leading provider of retail medical clinics and pharmacy benefits management services has acquired a leading health insurance provider, a leading health insurance provider has acquired a leading pharmacy benefits manager, and the corporate parent of a leading health insurance company provides a wide array of healthcare services through its non-insurance company subsidiaries. Health plans are entering agreements with other providers of healthcare services, including laboratory testing services providers, to partner on value-based approaches to delivering healthcare to populations. 

Consolidation is increasing pricing transparency and bargaining power, and may encourage internalization of clinical testing. 

Physicians frequently now are employed by IDNs, ACOs, DCEs or large group practices integrated with IDNs, instead of organizing physician-owned practices, which is impacting the dynamics for whether clinical testing is performed in or outside of an IDN. Physicians and other clinicians also increasingly are being employed by health plans or their affiliates. 

Value-based reimbursement is contributing to changes in the healthcare system. ACOs, DCEs and patient-centered medical homes have grown as a means to deliver patient care. Healthcare services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine, digital pathology). 

Changes are taking place in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the United States. IDNs are under significant pressure, and are evolving.

16 

Table of Contents 

Pricing transparencyThere has been a trend toward greater pricing transparency in healthcare, including in the laboratory testing marketplace. Several states have taken action to foster greater pricing transparency in healthcare. For example, Massachusetts launched a website to help consumers understand the wide variation in healthcare costs. Federal laws effective January 1, 2022 require health care providers to provide good faith estimates of costs to self-pay patients, and provide rights and protections for consumers against surprise billing or balance billing. In addition, the federal government requires providers of COVID-19 testing to post on their websites information regarding test pricing, and has adopted new legislation and issued new regulations designed to increase transparency regarding pricing and quality in healthcare, including requiring providers, group health plans and insurers to disclose cost information to consumers in advance of care being provided.

Increased price transparency, combined with increased patient financial responsibility for medical care, is enhancing purchasing sophistication and fostering changes in behavior in the healthcare marketplace. We believe that increased price transparency should benefit lower cost, high value providers like our Company.

Competition

The diagnostic information services industry remains fragmented, is highly competitive and is subject to new competition. 

Competition is emerging from new technologies (e.g., digital pathology) and growing from non-traditional competitors (e.g., a government agency or an employer establishing its own clinical laboratory for testing; providers of consumer-initiated testing). Increased IDN acquisitions of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to IDN-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position. However, in light of other trends, including continued reimbursement pressure, IDNs may change their approach to providing clinical testing services. 

New industry entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations.

Healthcare utilization

Healthcare utilization in the United States has fluctuated based on a number of factors. These factors include, without limitation, the economy, healthcare benefits design, patients delaying medical care (e.g., due to the COVID-19 pandemic), and increased consumer financial responsibility for, interest in and control of their healthcare. 

Reimbursement pressure; affordability

There is a strong focus in the United States on controlling the overall cost of healthcare. 

Healthcare market participants, including governments, are focused on controlling costs. Examples of cost control approaches include reducing reimbursement for healthcare services, changing reimbursement for healthcare services (e.g., shift from fee for service to capitation), changing medical coverage policies (e.g., healthcare benefits design), denying coverage for services, requiring preauthorization of laboratory testing, requiring co-pays, introducing laboratory spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as ACOs, DCEs and patient-centered medical homes. CMS has set goals for value-based reimbursement to be achieved in Medicare. There is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models.

The Health Transformation Alliance, a group of over 50 major U.S. companies, was formed to improve and reform the healthcare system in the United States. The rising cost of healthcare in the United States was a key driver for the formation of this alliance. 

While pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our Company, it also creates opportunities, such as an opportunity for increased proper utilization of testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare. We believe that it also creates greater opportunities for consolidation and gaining share for high value, lower-cost providers, like our Company, as compared to other providers.

Legislative, regulatory and policy environment

Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the United States is significant and increasing; healthcare payment reform and cost transparency are significant issues. 

Legislation introduced in Congress would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitro diagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease. If the legislation becomes law, the FDA could regulate diagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests. The FDA and HHS also have expressed views regarding the regulation of LDTs. Either new law or a revised approach to regulation of LDTs could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing. New competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms.

Use of healthcare data; technology The increased availability of healthcare data, including data made available as a result of next generation DNA sequencing, and the increased ability to effectively analyze that data at population and patient levels, is impacting healthcare practices. It is anticipated that the increased use of data in healthcare, coupled with mobile healthcare IT solutions for doctors and patients, will help to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall healthcare costs. We provide automated next generation genetic sequencing, which will enable genetic screening faster and at lower cost.

Use of healthcare data, including integrated diagnostic and decision support solutions, predictive analytics, and healthcare information technology, is spurring advances in precision medicine, including medical decision making and value, for populations and individuals. The increased focus on data and its use is increasing focus on maintaining the privacy of patient data.

There is a need for technology solutions to harness these opportunities. In addition, new technology, social media and mobile technology are changing the way that healthcare markets interact with each other, and the expectations that they have about how services are provided, what services are provided, and other capabilities of healthcare market participants. These developments are creating new opportunities and new challenges and disrupting the healthcare environment. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine practices became more commonly used; digital pathology is an emerging technology that may change the practice of pathology. Information technology that includes self-learning or "artificial intelligence" features is growing and may impact the healthcare industry. 

Healthcare market participants, including many of our customers discussed in table 13, are striving to leverage interoperability and healthcare data analysis to positively influence the health of patient populations while maintaining patient privacy.

Chronic diseases and conditions; gaps in careWe believe that the cost and challenges of identifying, treating and controlling chronic diseases and conditions such as diabetes and heart disease are now well recognized. 

As a result of multiple factors, including increased focus on population health management and pressure to reduce the systemic costs associated with such diseases and conditions, there is increased focus on better identifying and attempting to reduce or eliminate the gaps in care historically associated with these diseases and conditions. Healthcare market participants are developing new approaches for this purpose. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in delays in diagnosis and treatment of chronic diseases and conditions, particularly in underserved communities, increasing potential gaps in care. The COVID-19 pandemic called attention to gaps in care of these conditions in underserved populations; we believe that there also is increased focus on reducing or eliminating these gaps in care. 

Healthcare services delivery Healthcare delivery is moving out of hospitals, clinician offices and other traditional locations in which it had been provided. Care is increasingly being provided in new settings, such as outpatient, consumer-focused and home settings. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine practices became more commonly used. In addition, see the discussion of Emerging Retail Healthcare Providers in table 13. This dynamic offers new opportunities and challenges for healthcare providers and reflects not only efforts to take advantage of new technologies, but also the trends of consumerization and affordability, each of which are discussed above in this table.

The Value of Diagnostic Information Services

 There is an increased focus on the affordability of healthcare and on a disease-oriented approach to diagnostics, treatment and management. Healthcare providers, consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention and treatment. Healthcare providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease, to detect the symptoms of disease earlier, to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results. Table 12 highlights how diagnostic information services contribute to improving care and reducing healthcare costs. 

18 

Table of Contents 

Reducing Healthcare Costs and Improving Care (Table 12)

• Identifying patients at risk for disease before they require urgent care, hospital treatment or expensive therapies

• Helping clinicians to target the right medicines for the right patients at the right time

• Identifying treatment-related side effects

• Assessing early the efficacy of a therapy, enabling changes or discontinuation of ineffective therapies

• Enabling population health management by identifying gaps in care and delivery of targeted solutions to individuals who need care

• Identifying and proactively managing individuals at risk for chronic diseases, to decrease progression and associated costs and morbidity

• Providing telemedicine services along with laboratory testing to help individuals interpret and obtain appropriate advice and referrals into needed care

Customers 

 We provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers, including those discussed in table 13. As discussed in table 11 above, customers are consolidating, converging and diversifying. In many cases, the customer that orders our services is not responsible for paying for these services. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, the payer may be the patient or a third party, such as a health plan, Medicare or a Medicaid program. Increasingly, patients are bearing greater responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them, even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment. In addition, consumers are more frequently taking advantage of offerings like the Company's QuestDirect® offering, and requesting and paying for tests themselves.

Customers (Table 13)

Health plans including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers

These customers typically reimburse us as a contracted (or out-of-network) provider for services rendered to their members. In certain locations, health plans may delegate to IPAs or other alternative delivery systems (e.g., physician IDN organizations, ACOs, DCEs, patient-centered medical homes) the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members.

Health plans and IPAs often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements. Under capitated payment arrangements, we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us. Under some capitated programs, we may provide certain services on a negotiated fee-for-service basis. Reimbursement under programs that do not provide for capitated payments is typically negotiated on a fee-for-service basis.

Reimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled approximately 20%, and no one health plan accounted for 10%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2021. Health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers, and represent approximately one-half of our total clinical testing volume and approximately 43% of our net revenues from diagnostic information services. There has been a trend of consolidation among health plans. Some health plans also have narrowed their provider networks. In addition, some health plans have established "preferred provider" networks within their broader networks (e.g., UnitedHealthcare's Preferred Lab Network), in effect distinguishing among contracted providers. 

We are also sometimes a member of a “complementary network.” A complementary network generally is a set of contractual arrangements that a third party maintains with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers. A member of a health plan may choose to access a non-contracted provider that is a member of a complementary network; if so, the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network.

We offer to health plans services and programs that leverage our Company's expertise and resources, including our superior patient access, extensive test menu, medical staff, data, information technology solutions, and wellness and population health management capabilities. 

Since the beginning of 2019, the Company has had access to a very high percentage of the insured lives in the U.S., including very strong access in key high-population states. We believe that this strong access increases our attractiveness to other customer groups, including clinicians, patients and employers.

Clinicians

Clinicians, including primary care physicians, specialists and physician assistants, requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source for our services when patients choose their diagnostic information services provider. 

In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the number of physician practices owned by IDNs. There also has been a notable increase in some branches of medicine of the establishment of very large "rolled-up" specialty physician practice groups. IDNs that own physician practices may encourage or require the practices to refer outreach testing to the IDN's affiliated laboratory. Large specialty physician groups may encourage their members to refer testing to other members of the group. In each case, referrals to independent diagnostic services providers may be reduced.

Clinicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors, including those set forth in table 14.

20 

Table of Contents 

IDNsWe believe that we are an industry leader in servicing hospitals. We provide services to IDNs throughout the United States, including advanced testing services, in some cases managing or serving as the medical directors of their laboratories (including through our industry-leading Professional Lab Services offering discussed in table 3 above). IDNs generally maintain an on-site laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients (inpatients and outpatients) and refer certain testing to outside service providers, which typically charge the IDNs on a negotiated fee-for-service basis. Fee schedules for IDN reference testing services often are negotiated on behalf of IDNs by group purchasing organizations. 

We also have joint venture arrangements with leading IDNs in several metropolitan areas. These joint venture arrangements, which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated IDNs as well as for unaffiliated clinicians and other local healthcare providers, serve as our principal facilities in their service areas. Typically, we have either a majority ownership interest in, or day-to-day management responsibilities for, our joint venture relationships. 

In light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs, IDNs may change their approach to providing clinical testing services, including by insourcing tests, seeking ways to improve profitability or to better utilize their laboratory capacity. We believe that our combination of services positions us to be an attractive partner for IDNs, offering a full range of strategic relationships.

 ACOs and DCEs 

An ACO is a network of providers and facilities that share financial risk in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare. A DCE is a healthcare provider that is contracted directly with Medicare and agrees to assume some level of financial risk for providing Medicare services. ACOs and DCEs have increased in number; their impact on the provision of healthcare services to date has varied. 

ACOs and DCEs may exercise operational and financial control over providers across the continuum of care, and may function as a payer. Thus, they may be able to manage the health of a population group within a defined geography, and also may be able to influence the cost and quality of healthcare delivery. They may be encouraged to consider exclusive arrangements with healthcare providers, or to limit service providers.

We are actively engaging with ACOs and DCEs to demonstrate the value of our services. 

Employers

Employers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individual's employability and his or her “fitness for duty.” Companies with high levels of employee hiring, safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing. Factors such as the general economy, the job market and changes in the legal environment (e.g., marijuana decriminalization) can impact the utilization of drugs-of-abuse testing. Some employers retain third party administrators to handle such testing and related services; we support the needs of third party administrators as well as employers who retain us directly. 

Employers also are investing in population health services. We meet their needs by providing nationwide access to our customizable services (discussed above at page 13), directly and through health plan and health improvement providers. These services help employers, employees and others manage healthcare costs, capitalize on trends in personalized health and improve health outcomes. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our offerings to employers to assist their pandemic response to create safer workplaces (discussed above at page 13). 

We seek to grow our employer business through offering new and innovative programs to help them with their goals of (1) maintaining a safe and productive workplace, (2) improving healthcare for employees and (3) lowering healthcare costs for employees and employers. 

Consumers We are well positioned to provide information and insights to patients to help them take actions to improve their healthcare. The changing expectations of patients about their healthcare and their healthcare transactions are influencing our services and the way we provide them. See the discussions of our consumer strategy at page 5 and consumerization above in table 11. 

FQHCsFederally Qualified Health Centers offer a broad array of healthcare services, including to historically underserved populations. We strive to offer an attractive array of services to FQHCs to demonstrate the value of our services.

Table of Contents 

Emerging Retail Healthcare Providers

In recent years, as the healthcare sector changes, retail providers of healthcare services have emerged and are growing. These providers include "big-box" retailers, pharmacy chains, supermarkets, urgent care centers and Internet-based service providers. 

We are taking advantage of opportunities to work with these providers, not only to offer new access partners (e.g., CVS retail locations) and new access points for our services (e.g., our collaboration with Safeway), but also to grow our business by expanding our service offerings (e.g., our joint venture with Walmart). See the discussion of our consumer strategy at page 5.

 Government AgenciesWe provide services on a fee-for-service basis to federal, state and local governmental agencies.

Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government. Over the last several years, the federal government has expanded its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs. There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. States also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided additional services to and in conjunction with government agencies across the United States in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Pharmaceutical companies

We have expertise with laboratory developed tests for companion and complementary diagnostics, and offer an array of assets and services to support the development of companion diagnostics, including our robust data set and patient services network. 

We also offer Quest Clinical Trials Connect,TM to help accelerate clinical trials (and thus the speed of drugs to market) through better patient recruitment, involvement and management, and improved physician outreach.

Other LaboratoriesWe provide services on a fee-for-service basis to other commercial clinical laboratories.

 Competition. While there has been consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years, our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: commercial clinical laboratories, IDN-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories. Our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc. In addition, we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories, specialized advanced laboratories and providers of consumer-initiated testing. In anatomic pathology, we compete with anatomic pathology practices, including those in academic institutions and large physician group practices, and providers of emerging digital pathology solutions. There also has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities and/or bring pathologists into their practices, thereby reducing referrals from these practices and increasing the competitive position of these practices.

Healthcare providers consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider.

Potential Factors Considered When Selecting a Diagnostic Information Services Provider (Table 14)

• Service capability and quality• Reputation in the medical community

• Accuracy, timeliness and consistency in reporting test results• Healthcare information technology solutions, including connectivity options

• Access to medical/scientific thought leaders for consultation• Patient access, including the number, convenience and geographic coverage of patient service centers

• Patient insurance coverage and experience• Ability to develop new and useful tests and services

• Number and type of tests performed• Qualifications of its staff

• Pricing and overall value• Provider office workflow 

• Real time payment determination• Capabilities to support population health initiatives 0

 We believe that providing the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a positive customer experience, a staff including medical and scientific experts, strong quality, unparalleled access and distribution, and data-powered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage.

22 

Table of Contents 

 We believe that large diagnostic information services providers have a competitive advantage due to their large networks and lower cost structures. These advantages should enable larger providers to serve customers more effectively. In addition, we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue. However, a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by IDNs, which generally have affiliations with community clinicians and may have more, or more convenient, locations in a market. As a result, we compete against IDN-affiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability, quality and pricing. In addition, market activity may increase the competitive environment. For example, IDN ownership of physician practices may enhance the ties of the clinicians to IDN-affiliated laboratories, enhancing the competitive position of IDN-affiliated laboratories. ACOs and DCEs and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services.

 The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology, new product introductions and new service offerings. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Digital pathology, still in an emerging state, is an example of this. Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) testing that can be performed by IDNs in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. 

 The risk assessment and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive. We have many competitors, some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources. We compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a wider array of quality, integrated services than our competitors, faster services completion and a superior applicant experience. We compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers, including smaller and medium sized physician practices.

GENERAL 

 Human Capital Management. Creating an inspiring workplace is one of our three corporate goals, and this goal drives our approach to human capital management. Effectively managing our human capital resources is a priority with key components that include culture, safety and well-being programs, employee engagement, and training, development and succession planning. Our Board of Directors actively engages in oversight of our human capital management, including by receiving management reports on key areas, strategies and initiatives. Additional information about our human capital management strategies and initiatives is available in our annual corporate responsibility report. 

 As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 49,000 employees, of whom approximately 40,000 are full-time and the remainder are part-time or on-call. Our employee population is more diverse than the U.S. workforce, taken as a whole. Approximately 71% of our employees globally identify as women; approximately 51% of our U.S. employees identify as people of color. A majority of our employees work directly with our customers or in our laboratories. Fewer than 1% of our employees are represented by a union. We believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.

 Culture. We strive to foster a strong culture, built on our Code of Ethics, which reinforces our commitment to integrity and aligns with our vision, values, goals and brand. Our Quest Management System, discussed above at page 8, supports our effort to maintain a focus on high performance. We also focus on building and maintaining a collaborative, diverse and inclusive culture in which all employees are empowered to raise and discuss difficult issues and valued for their strengths, experience and unique perspectives (our focus on diversity and inclusion is discussed further below). We encourage our employees to actively participate in their communities, and support their participation, including offering incentives for participation. Our Everyday Excellence program includes guiding principles for our entire organization to support a superior customer experience and inspire employees to be their best every day, with every person and with every customer interaction; the program is integrated into performance assessments and frontline employee behavioral standards. Our Recognition Quest Program reinforces our commitment to recognize above and beyond contributions and to demonstrating how much we value, care for and appreciate one another by regularly celebrating and rewarding one another as we work together. 

 Safety and Well-Being. The health and safety of our employees is of paramount concern. We use a systematic, risk-based approach to develop tailored incident prevention and response programs designed to keep our employees safe in each of our diverse functional areas, and use data insights and a detailed audit program to foster the effectiveness of our programs. We have a comprehensive curriculum of annual safety training, as well as training for new employees. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our cross-functional Safely Working Together Steering Committee designed and implemented tactics, techniques and procedures to enable our colleagues to continue to work safely. As part of our comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits program, we also offer innovative initiatives to support the well-being of our employees and their

families through our HealthyQuest program. The cornerstone of HealthyQuest is our Blueprint for Wellness program, which empowers our employees and their dependents with health insights based on lab and biometric data and invites them each year to take the initiative to improve their physical and mental health. We also offer other programs designed to engage employees in managing their health, including access to medical expertise and support programs tailored to their individual needs, helping them to adopt healthier behaviors and access better care at lower costs. These include customized programs for conditions such as type 2 diabetes management, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular disease, zero-cost lab testing and specialty drugs, and special support for orthopedic surgery and for cancer and other serious diagnoses. For 2022, we enhanced our mental health offering for employees.

 Inclusion and Diversity. We understand the need to create an environment where employees can bring their whole selves to work. We aim to harness the unique mix of capabilities, talents, cultures, beliefs and experience of our employees and create a workforce that is demographically diverse at all levels of the organization. Through our CTC Framework (focusing on Culture, Talent and Community), we prioritize diversity across the entire talent lifecycle, with the goals of supporting employees throughout their careers at Quest, ensuring transparency and identifying opportunities for action. In 2021, we continued to focus on inclusion and diversity issues through additional training for leaders and other employees. We also continued, with the Quest Diagnostics Foundation, Quest for Health Equity, our initiative to help reduce health disparities in underserved communities.

 Engagement. Since 1997, we have sought to foster the engagement and enablement of our employees, and have regularly surveyed our employees to assess their engagement. Employee engagement has been a metric in the annual incentive plan for our executive officers since 2013. In 2020, we launched a new strategy for gathering employee feedback that utilizes more frequent employee surveys. This approach is designed to build an agile culture, based on continuous feedback that fuels ongoing conversations about priorities, performance, opportunities and growth, to result in a higher performing organization and committed employees. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have held weekly or bi-weekly meetings among hundreds of company leaders to foster increased communication across the company regarding topics of concern to employees. 

 Training, Development and Succession Planning. We provide training on a wide array of topics to our employees through live and online formats, including opportunities that can be accessed through their mobile devices. We also offer a number of development opportunities for our employees, such as mentoring and education programs, including a higher education tuition reimbursement or assistance program. In addition, we provide leadership training opportunities for employees at all levels, including a manager essentials curriculum, our Leading Quest Supervisor and Manager Core Program, coaching programs and trainings to strengthen critical leadership skills. We also deliver a number of programs tailored to specific functions to drive a high-performance culture and sharpen the capabilities needed to lead our organization (e.g., our Commercial, Finance, Pathology, R&D, and Product Management Leadership Programs). We have a robust talent assessment and succession planning process to promote business continuity, including at the most senior levels; this planning is linked to our engagement and inclusion and diversity initiatives, to foster those efforts. 

 Sales and Marketing. Our Diagnostic Information Services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale of most of our services. It coordinates closely with our clinical franchises (discussed above under the heading Innovation) and marketing organization. The commercial organization is centrally led, and is organized regionally, in conjunction with our operations organization, to focus on local customer needs and to ensure aligned delivery for our customers. Our commercial organization employs world-class processes and tools and strong management discipline. We provide industry-leading training and development, focus on opportunities with IDNs and specialty physicians, and foster a customer-focused, performance-driven culture. We also maintain distinct sales and marketing organizations for our offerings in Diagnostic Solutions and our employer drugs-of-abuse testing services. In 2021, we launched a new marketing campaign designed to remind customers of the value that we bring to healthcare. Our "Powering Affordable Care" campaign speaks about our leadership in clinical innovation, our ability to enable better clinical outcomes, our improved patient experience and our ability to reduce the cost of care.

 Information Technology. We use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data. We endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our Company and customers. The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. We take precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems.

 Some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and, as a result, we continue to use multiple information systems. We have made significant progress implementing common systems in our regional laboratories, and we continue to standardize laboratory information and billing systems across our operations. We expect that our standardization efforts will 

24 

Table of Contents 

take several more years to complete, and will result in significantly more centralized systems, improved operating efficiency, more positive customer experiences and enhanced control over our operational environment. Even after we complete our efforts to standardize our legacy systems, we will need to focus on standardizing systems in connection with future business acquisitions.

 Quality Assurance. As discussed further under the heading Quality on page 7, our goal is to provide every patient with services and products of superior quality, and to meet that goal we employ the Quest Management System. Employing root cause analysis, process improvements and rigorous tracking and measuring, we continuously seek to enhance quality, reduce defects, further increase the efficacy and efficiency of our operations and processes, eliminate waste and help standardize operations across our Company. 

 In our laboratory operations, our quality assurance efforts focus on pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic processes, including positive patient identification of specimens, appropriate specimen transport, analysis and report accuracy, reference interval establishment and review, statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers. As part of our quality assurance program, we utilize internal proficiency testing, comprehensive quality control and rigorous process audits. We have introduced comprehensive and digitized data analytics software that implements advanced automated quality control procedures, offering both real-time and post-analytic analysis of data at the laboratory and corporate level. We monitor test results to identify trends, biases, instrument failures and population shifts through digitization and data analytics. We also focus on the licensing, credentialing, training and competence of our professional and technical staff. For example, our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peer-review evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs.

 We have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations, such as CMS, CAP and certain states. All of our laboratories participate in external quality surveillance programs, including proficiency testing programs administered by CAP and several state agencies. CAP is an independent, nongovernmental organization of board-certified pathologists approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by CLIA. CAP offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe. All of our major laboratories, including our laboratories outside the U.S., and a number of our rapid response laboratories, are accredited by CAP. Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or equivalent) proficiency testing program. In addition, some of our laboratories also have International Organization for Standardization (ISO) certification for their quality management systems. 

 We maintain a robust Supplier Quality Program designed to ensure a high quality supplier network and to raise the bar of quality expectation across that network. We expect suppliers to provide the highest quality products and services and to embrace an ethic of transparent quality collaboration. In our program, we aim to ensure and improve the quality of purchased products and services. Our suppliers are expected to operate under quality management principles that meet industry standards, strive for zero defect manufacturing, use statistical analysis to reduce variation and meet applicable regulatory standards. In choosing suppliers, we evaluate their quality systems and quality performance metrics. Our supplier qualification process is risk-based, with assessments and on-site audits based on risk tiers. Contracts with our suppliers include specific quality, compliance, and change management provisions as appropriate. We use supplier quality engineers who are trained to audit on ISO standards and FDA regulations applicable to suppliers’ processes, and a procurement engineering team to assist with qualification and validation of new supplies and products. We actively manage supplier performance, utilizing a problem reporting and resolution process designed to drive to root cause and corrective actions. We maintain a continuous improvement dialogue with our suppliers, and with operationally critical suppliers deliver a supplier scorecard that supports continuous improvement. 

 We also maintain quality assurance programs for IDN laboratories that we manage, and for our services offerings outside laboratories. 

 Intellectual Property Rights. We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. From time to time, we also license patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others; we also may license our intellectual property to others. In the aggregate, our intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business. We believe, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole. Our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets, to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise. We actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products, processes and other intellectual property where possible.

 Enterprise Risk Management Program. We maintain an enterprise risk management program designed to promote a culture of risk awareness throughout the Company's key business, operations and support functions. Our program, which is 

25 

Table of Contents 

integrated with the Company’s governance, performance management and internal control frameworks, entails a formal continuous process that identifies, assesses, mitigates and manages the risks from both internal and external conditions that could significantly impact the Company and influence its business strategy and performance. The program is based on the most recent framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, which focuses on the following risk types:

•Operational risk - risks arising from systems, processes, people and external events that affect the Company’s operational objectives or fundamental reason for its existence, including: product life-cycle and execution; service quality and performance; information management and data protection and security, including cybersecurity; supply chain and business disruption; and other risks, including human capital and reputation.

•Financial risk - risks arising from the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations pursuant to its strategic and operational objectives, including exposure to broad market and more specific industry risk that could impact liquidity, interest rate, credit, pricing and reimbursement, and also to internal and external financial reporting. 

•Legal and compliance risk - risks arising from the regulatory and enforcement environment, legal proceedings and adherence to ethics and compliance policies and procedures. 

•Strategic risk - risks that will impede the Company’s plan to achieve its mission and vision and apply its core values, including changes in the broad market and Company's industry, business development and restructuring activities, competitive threats and practices, technology and product innovation, and public policy. 

 As part of our program, we routinely assess our enterprise level risks, emerging risks, overall Company-level risk tolerance and the effectiveness of risk management, and monitor the progress of and resources applied to risk mitigation; our Board of Directors actively oversees our program. Our primary risk factors are discussed in Risk Factors beginning on page 32. 

 Billing; Government Reimbursement. We generally bill for diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis under one of two types of fee schedules; fees may be negotiated or discounted. The types of fee schedules are:

•“Client” fees charged to physicians, IDNs and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis.

•“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain third-party payers on a claim-by-claim basis.

 Billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated. Our customers, discussed in table 13, have different billing requirements. Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among payers; incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering clinicians; and lack of access to patients before testing). We maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing practices, and we audit our practices for compliance with applicable laws and regulations and internal policies and procedures. 

 With regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, we generally must bill Medicare directly and must accept the Medicare carrier's fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full. In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare. Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic testing services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, but generally does require a patient deductible and co-insurance for anatomic pathology services. 

 Part B of the Medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules. Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under that program have been subject to change, including each year. Pursuant to PAMA, reimbursement rates for many clinical laboratory tests provided under Medicare were reduced from 2018 - 2020. PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on future surveys of market rates; reimbursement reduction from 2023-25 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually. PAMA's next data collection and reporting period have been delayed, most recently by federal legislation adopted in December 2021, which further delayed the reimbursement rate reductions and reporting requirements until January 1, 2023.

 Our net revenues reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid in 2021 were lower as a percentage of our consolidated net revenues than in recent years (excluding 2020, when we also experienced significant COVID-19 testing). Excluding revenues attributable to COVID-19 testing, approximately 13% of our net revenues were reimbursed under Medicare and Medicaid in 2021, compared to approximately 15% in 2019. 

REGULATION 

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and other jurisdictions in which we conduct business, and to government inspections and audits. 

Key Regulatory Schemes (Table 16)

CLIA and State Clinical Laboratory Licensing

CLIA regulates the operations of virtually all clinical laboratories, requiring that they be certified by the federal government and that they comply with various technical, operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable and timely. 

State laws may require additional personnel qualifications or licenses, quality control, record maintenance, proficiency testing or detailed review of our scientific method validations and technical procedures for certain tests. 

Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs.

Medicare and Medicaid; Fraud and AbuseDiagnostic testing services provided under Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to complex, evolving, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to billing, coverage and reimbursement. 

Anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs. 

In addition, federal and state anti-self-referral laws generally prohibit Medicare and Medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have an ownership or investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, the testing laboratory, unless specific exceptions are met.

Some states have similar laws that are not limited in applicability to only Medicare and Medicaid referrals and could also affect tests that are paid for by health plans and other non-governmental payers. 

Violations of these laws and regulations may result in monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs.

FDA

The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. The FDA also regulates drugs-of-abuse testing for employers and insurers, testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such as in vitro fertilization. 

A number of advanced tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. 

Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA issued final guidance regarding its position on the regulation of clinical decision software, which may be used in connection with LDTs. The guidance attempts to address uncertainty regarding whether FDA approval of certain software is required. It has been used by the FDA, in part, to assert authority over the annotation software aspects of pharmacogenetic testing services.

Legislation introduced in Congress would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitro diagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease. The FDA and the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services also have expressed views regarding the regulation of LDTs. Either new law or a revised approach to regulation of LDTs could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways, while creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing. New competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms. 

Environmental, Health and Safety

We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. 

For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. 

For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. 

PhysiciansOur pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice. 

Several jurisdictions in which our businesses are located prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine. In certain jurisdictions, business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation; these laws vary. In some jurisdictions, anatomic pathology services are delivered through physician-owned entities that employ the practicing pathologists. The manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the jurisdictions in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these jurisdictions to oversee the practice of medicine. 

Privacy and Security of Health and Personal Information

We are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws, including the California Consumer Privacy Act and similar laws in other states ; and (c) laws outside the U.S., including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation. 

A healthcare provider may be subject to penalties for non-compliance and may be required to notify individuals or state, federal or county governments if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information.

Drug Testing; Controlled Substances

All U.S. laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. 

To obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugs-of-abuse testing in the United States, laboratories must be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. 

 Compliance. We strive to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. We license and maintain appropriate accreditations for all of our laboratories and, where applicable, patient service centers, as required by federal and state agencies. We have a long-standing and well-established compliance program. The Quality and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees, and receives periodic management reports regarding, our compliance program. Our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the implementation and observance of all applicable laws and regulations (including regarding billing and reimbursement, and privacy of protected health information and personally identifiable information) and Company policies. Further, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations. We conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures.

 As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements. Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments resulting from non-compliance are refunded by us. As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, refunded the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.
