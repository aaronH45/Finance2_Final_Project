MD&A is intended to assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and supplemental financial information. It should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K, and other information contained in this document. For discussion of 2020 results as compared to 2019 results, see "Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Executive Overview

Truist financial performance in 2021 was solid, highlighted by strong performances from investment banking, insurance, wealth and card and payment related fees, and positive trends in a number of other businesses given improving economic conditions. Improving economic conditions also led to a strong credit performance and a benefit from the provision for credit losses. Truist achieved its fourth quarter 2021 net cost saves target and continues to reaffirm its commitment to achieving $1.6 billion in net cost saves on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of 2022. Truist also continues to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on stakeholders and the financial markets, and is actively supporting teammates, clients, and communities. Truist formed a Together Safely Committee focused on developing new working models in a post-pandemic era. Further, Truist continued to activate its Integrated Relationship Management approach, which is designed to deepen client relationships and bring the full breadth and depth of Truist’s products and services to meet clients’ financial needs. As we enter 2022 and shift priorities, aiming past systems integrations and the pandemic, Truist is well positioned for purposeful growth.

Executive Leadership Changes

Truist made several Executive Leadership changes during 2021 as we continued to execute on the strategy first agreed upon in the Merger. In September 2021, Kelly S. King, transitioned to the role of Executive Chairman, and William H. Rogers, Jr. became the CEO of Truist. There were other changes to Truist’s Executive Leadership team that included the addition of John M. Howard, as Chief Insurance Officer, the appointment of Hugh S. Cummins III as Vice Chair, and the retirement of Christopher L. Henson, Head of Banking and Insurance. The members of the Executive Leadership team as of December 31, 2021 are detailed in the Executive Officers table within Item 1 “Business.”

In January 2022, Truist appointed Denise M. DeMaio as Chief Audit Officer, effective February 28, 2022. Denise will join the Executive leadership team and will lead Truist's internal audit function and provide counsel to senior management on emerging risk trends from the vantage points of governance, processes, technologies and reporting.

ESG Efforts

Supporting Clients

Truist is committed to investing in and serving all clients, no matter where they are in their financial journey. Some of the ways we are helping clients include:

•In January 2022, Truist announced a first-of-its-kind approach to the checking account experience, designed to address clients’ direct feedback, which will be available to clients beginning in the summer of 2022. The Truist One checking account features will include: no overdraft fees; a $100 negative balance buffer for qualifying clients; an easily accessible, deposit-based line of credit of up to $750; and premium rewards that instantly recognize relationships and honor loyalty. In addition, Truist will offer an alternative checking account product created for clients who are new to credit and want simplicity and control without overdraft fees. This will help clients avoid high fees from check-cashing and payday lenders, bring many more households into mainstream banking, and create a pathway to upgrade to Truist One.

•Increased access to financial education for Truist’s clients through a partnership with Operation HOPE.

•Partnering with the Bank Policy Institute to publish the Child Tax Credit Toolkit and promoting Child Tax Credit expansion awareness with modules on all digital financial education platforms.

•Truist continues to work closely with clients as they navigate through the continuing challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic. Truist ranked as the fourth largest PPP lender amongst commercial banks overall.

Supporting Teammates

•Truist met its commitment to increase racially and ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles to more than 15% one year early with 15.1% as of December 31, 2021.

•Truist offered a voluntary separation and retirement program to eligible teammates in June 2021. While Truist is hiring in some areas and rightsizing in others through natural attrition, planned staffing reductions, and the voluntary separation and retirement program, Truist is actively supporting all teammates affected by reductions with opportunities and tools for internal placement, severance payments, and outplacement assistance and coaching. The Company recognized $231 million of merger-related and restructuring charges in 2021 related to the voluntary separation and retirement program.

•Implemented onsite, remote, and hybrid work styles in order to provide the most flexible work environment.

Additionally, the 2021 results include charitable contributions of $200 million ($153 million after-tax), an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges of $36 million ($28 million after tax), and a one-time professional fee expense of $30 million ($23 million after tax), partially offset by a small gain on extinguishment of debt. The 2020 results include securities gains of $402 million ($308 million after-tax), a loss on extinguishment of debt of $235 million ($180 million after tax), and charitable contributions of $50 million ($38 million after-tax). The following table provides Truist’s earnings highlights:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Truist's revenue for 2021 was $22.3 billion. On a TE basis, revenue was $22.4 billion, which represents a decrease of $426 million compared to 2020. Net interest income on a TE basis was $13.1 billion, a decrease of $837 million. The decrease in net interest income was due primarily to lower purchase accounting accretion and a $21.1 billion decrease in average outstanding loans, partially offset by a $56.3 billion increase in average securities as a result of strong deposit growth. Noninterest income for 2021 increased $411 million compared to 2020 due to strong performance from investment banking, insurance, wealth, and card and payment related fees. Excluding gains of $37 million from the divestiture of certain businesses in 2021 and securities gains of $402 million from 2020, adjusted taxable equivalent revenues decreased $61 million, or 0.3%, compared to the earlier year.

NIM was 2.86% for 2021, down 36 basis points compared to the prior year. Average earning assets increased $24.4 billion or 5.6%, while average interest-bearing liabilities decreased $1.4 billion or 0.5%, and noninterest-bearing deposits increased $24.2 billion or 21%.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $813 million, compared to a cost of $2.3 billion for the prior year. Net charge-offs were $697 million, compared to $1.1 billion for the prior year. Asset quality ratios were relatively stable at December 31, 2021 compared to the prior year, reflecting Truist’s prudent risk culture, portfolio diversification, improving economic conditions, and the ongoing effects of government stimulus. The ratio of the ALLL to net charge-offs was 6.36X for 2021, compared to 5.21X in 2020, reflecting lower net charge-offs. NPAs decreased $224 million year over year due to declines across almost all portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the indirect auto portfolio.

Noninterest income increased $411 million, or 4.6%, compared to the prior year. Excluding securities gains and a gain on the divestiture of certain businesses, noninterest income was up $776 million, or 9.2%, highlighted by strong performance from investment banking, insurance, wealth, and card and payment related fees.

Noninterest expense increased $219 million, or 1.5%, compared to the prior year. Excluding merger-related and restructuring charges, incremental operating expenses related to the Merger, the impact of the extinguishment of debt, charitable contributions, an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges, a one-time professional fee expense, and the impact of amortization expense for intangibles, noninterest expense increased $154 million, or 1.2%. This increase in noninterest expense was driven by incentives expense due to stronger performance and insurance acquisitions, partially offset by the ongoing impact of cost saving efforts from the Merger.

Truist's total assets at December 31, 2021 were $541.2 billion, an increase of $32.0 billion compared to December 31, 2020, reflecting a $33.8 billion increase in securities, a $2.3 billion increase in securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, a $2.1 billion increase in goodwill and intangible assets, partially offset by a decrease of loans and leases HFI, net of ALLL, of $8.8 billion.

Total shareholders' equity was $69.3 billion at December 31, 2021, down $1.6 billion compared to the prior year, reflecting a decrease in AOCI of $2.3 billion, primarily due to unrealized losses on AFS debt securities, $1.6 billion common share repurchases, and the redemption of $1.4 billion of preferred shares, partially offset by net income in excess of dividends paid of $3.6 billion.

Truist maintained strong capital and liquidity in 2021. As of December 31, 2021, the CET1 ratio was 9.6% and the average LCR was 114%.

In early 2022, Truist declared common dividends of $0.48 per share for the first quarter of 2022, and announced the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard National Land Services to expand IH’s title insurance operation.

Key Areas of Focus

Truist's business is dynamic and complex. Consequently, management annually evaluates and, as necessary, adjusts the Company’s business strategy in the context of the current operating environment. During this process, management considers the current financial condition and performance of the Company and its expectations for future economic activity from both a national and local market perspective. Achieving key strategic objectives and established long-term financial goals is subject to many uncertainties and challenges. In the opinion of management, the following are the key areas of focus most likely to impact Truist’s near to medium term performance:

•Championing the Company’s purpose to inspire and build better lives and communities;

•Leading with purpose to provide profitable growth and achieve positive operating leverage;

•Shifting from an integration focus to an operating focus, with a particular emphasis on executional excellence and profitable growth,

•Attracting and retaining key teammates and advancing teammate and leadership development;

•Driving innovation and remaining attuned to evolving client preferences to succeed in an intensely competitive environment;

•Executing the Company’s "T3 strategy" by focusing on personal touch and technology to engender trust and provide distinctive, secure and successful client experiences;

•Advancing DEI and ESG initiatives;

•Achieving the benefits from the Merger, including anticipated synergies through cost saving and Truist’s Integrated Relationship Management approach; and

•Managing the integration of systems and operations, while safeguarding the Company against external threats.

In addition, certain other challenges and unforeseen events could have a near term impact on Truist's financial condition and results of operations. See the sections titled "Forward-Looking Statements" and "Risk Factors" for additional examples of such challenges.

Analysis of Results of Operations

Net Interest Income and NIM

2021 compared to 2020

Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was down $837 million, or 6.0%, compared to the prior year due to lower purchase accounting accretion, lower rates on earning assets, and a decrease in loan balances. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the securities portfolio, lower funding costs, higher fees on PPP loans, and releases of interest deferrals related to COVID-19 loan accommodations established in 2020. Average earning assets increased $24.4 billion, or 5.6%, compared to the prior period. The increase in average earning assets reflects a $56.3 billion, or 68%, increase in average securities, while average total loans and leases decreased $21.1 billion, or 6.7%, and average other earning assets decreased $11.7 billion, or 38%. The growth in average earning assets is a result of an increase in investment securities driven by strong deposit growth resulting from fiscal and monetary stimulus. Average deposits increased $35.1 billion, or 9.7%, compared to the prior year, while average long-term debt and short-term borrowings decreased $8.4 billion, or 18%, and $4.0 billion, or 39%, respectively.

Net interest margin was 2.86% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down 36 basis points compared to the prior year. The yield on the total loan portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 3.95%, down 38 basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of lower purchase accounting accretion and the ongoing impact of the low rate environment. The yield on the average securities portfolio was 1.50% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down 59 basis points compared to the prior year primarily due to lower yields on new purchases and higher premium amortization.

The average cost of total deposits was 0.04% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down 18 basis points compared to the prior year. The average cost on short-term borrowings was 0.76% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down 59 basis points compared to the prior year. The average cost on long-term debt was 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down 22 basis points compared to the prior year. The lower rates on interest-bearing liabilities reflect the lower rate environment.

As of December 31, 2021, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits, and long-term debt were $1.3 billion, $7 million, and $139 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining unamortized fair value marks on the loan and lease portfolio, deposits and long-term debt were $2.4 billion, $19 million, and $216 million, respectively.

The remaining unamortized fair value mark on loans and leases consist of $700 million for consumer loans and leases, and $623 million for commercial loans and leases. These amounts will be recognized over the remaining contractual lives of the underlying instruments or as paydowns occur.

The major components of net interest income and the related annualized yields as well as the variances between the periods caused by changes in interest rates versus changes in volumes are summarized below.

Provision for Credit Losses

2021 compared to 2020

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $813 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to a cost of $2.3 billion for the prior year. The prior year included significant uncertainty related to the economic impacts resulting from the pandemic, whereas the current year includes reserve releases due to the improving economic outlook. Net charge-offs for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $697 million compared to $1.1 billion in the prior year. Net charge-offs for 2020 included $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of CECL as more fully discussed in the “ACL” section of MD&A. The net charge-off ratio for the current year of 0.24% was down 12 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily driven by lower losses across the majority of portfolios, partially driven by additional losses on PCD loans taken in 2020, combined with higher recoveries.

Noninterest Income

Noninterest income is a significant contributor to Truist’s financial results. Management focuses on diversifying its sources of revenue to reduce Truist’s reliance on traditional spread-based interest income, as certain fee-based activities are a relatively stable revenue source during periods of changing interest rates.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company reclassified certain structured real estate activity from commercial mortgage income to investment banking trading income and certain LIHTC activity from commercial mortgage income to other income. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

2021 compared to 2020

Noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $411 million, or 4.6%, compared to the prior year. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a $37 million gain from the divestiture of certain businesses, whereas noninterest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $402 million of securities gains on available-for-sale securities. Excluding securities gains and a gain on the divestiture of certain businesses, noninterest income was up $776 million, or 9.2%, compared to the prior year. Insurance income increased $434 million due to acquisitions, as well as organic growth. Investment banking and trading income increased $431 million due to strong investment banking income from loan syndications and merger and acquisition fees, and structured real estate income, and the impact from CVA recoveries in the current year compared to losses in the earlier year. Other income increased $140 million primarily due to $96 million related to increased investment income (primarily valuations gains) from the Company’s SBIC and Truist Ventures investments and higher valuations of $46 million for assets held for certain post-retirement benefits, which is primarily offset by higher benefits expense included in personnel expense. Wealth management increased $115 million due to higher valuations of assets under management, partially offset by the divestiture of the record keeping business. Card and payment related fees and service charges on deposits increased $113 million and $40 million, respectively, due to increased economic activity. Lending related fees increased $34 million due to higher noninterest loan fees, primarily unused line fees. Residential mortgage banking income decreased $445 million primarily due to lower production related revenues as a result of lower gain on sale margins and volumes, partially offset by higher servicing income due to an increase in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. Operating lease income decreased $47 million due to declines in the lease portfolio.

Truist Financial Corporation 45

Noninterest Expense

The following table provides a breakdown of Truist’s noninterest expense:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2021 compared to 2020

Noninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was up $219 million, or 1.5%, compared to the earlier year. Merger-related and restructuring charges decreased $38 million and other incremental operating expenses related to the Merger increased $237 million, primarily reflected in professional fees and outside processing expense. The current year also includes $200 million for charitable contributions to the Truist Foundation and the Truist Charitable Fund (other expense), $36 million of expense associated with an acceleration of loss recognition related to certain terminated cash flow hedges, a $30 million professional fee expense, and a small gain on the early extinguishment of debt, whereas the earlier year included a $235 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt and a $50 million charitable contribution. Excluding the aforementioned items and a decrease of $111 million for amortization of intangibles, noninterest expense increased $154 million, or 1.2%, compared to the earlier year. Personnel expense increased $486 million primarily driven by higher incentive expenses due to variable compensation from higher revenues and improved overall performance relative to targets, higher medical insurance claims, higher other employee benefits due to the previously mentioned increase in noninterest income, and personnel cost related to acquired companies. These increases in personnel expense were partially offset by lower salaries due to fewer FTEs. Software expense increased $83 million due to higher spending on certain projects. Other expense includes a decrease of $167 million for non-service-related pension cost components. There was also a decrease of $140 million from net occupancy expense primarily due to branch and property consolidations and a decrease in operating lease depreciation of $68 million due to valuation adjustments taken in the prior year.

Merger-Related and Restructuring Charges

Truist has incurred certain merger-related and restructuring charges, which include:

•severance and personnel-related costs or credits;

•occupancy and equipment charges or credits, which relate to costs or gains associated with lease terminations, obsolete equipment write-offs and the sale of duplicate facilities and equipment;

•professional services, which relate to legal and investment banking advisory fees and other consulting services pertaining to restructuring initiatives or transactions;

Merger and restructuring accruals are re-evaluated periodically and adjusted as necessary. The remaining accruals at December 31, 2021 are generally expected to be utilized within one year, unless they relate to specific contracts that expire later.

46 Truist Financial Corporation

The following table presents a summary of merger-related and restructuring charges and the related accruals. The 2021 and 2020 merger-related and restructuring costs primarily reflect charges as a result of the Merger, including costs for severance and other benefits, costs related to exiting facilities, and other restructuring initiatives.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2021 compared to 2020

Consumer Banking and Wealth

Consumer Banking and Wealth had 2,517 banking offices at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 264 offices compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease in offices was driven primarily by the consolidation of 226 branches in the first quarter leveraging the blended branch program strategy, as well as closure of 39 branches in non-overlapping markets in the third quarter.

Consumer Banking and Wealth net income was $3.2 billion for 2021, an increase of $192 million, or 6.3%, compared to 2020. Segment net interest income decreased $533 million primarily due to reduced funding credit on deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion, and a decline in average loans. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $853 million primarily due to allowance releases in the current year as the economic outlook improved as well as lower net charge offs in the auto, home equity, card, and mortgage portfolios and lower loan balances compared to reserve builds in 2020 due to uncertainty regarding the pandemic. Noninterest income decreased $206 million, due to lower residential mortgage income driven by lower gain on sale margins and volumes, partially offset by increased revenues in wealth management and card and payment related activities resulting from improving economic conditions as well as gains from the divestiture of certain businesses. Noninterest expense decreased $131 million primarily due to lower salary expense, pension costs, amortization of intangibles, and occupancy expenses, partially offset by increased incentives tied to performance and related benefits expense in the current year.

Truist Financial Corporation 47

Consumer Banking and Wealth average loans and leases HFI decreased $6.8 billion, or 4.9%, compared to 2020 driven primarily by a decline in residential mortgage loans and home equity and direct lending, partially offset by increased indirect auto and mortgage warehouse lending. Average loan and leases HFI for residential mortgage and home equity and direct loans declined $5.9 billion, or 12%, and $1.6 billion, or 6.0%, respectively, while indirect auto and mortgage warehouse loans increased $1.6 billion, or 6.3%, and $649 million, or 16%, respectively.

Consumer Banking and Wealth average total deposits increased $25.2 billion, or 12%, compared to 2020 driven primarily due to ongoing impacts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Average noninterest-bearing deposits, money market and savings accounts, and interest checking accounts increased $11.7 billion, or 21%, $11.1 billion, or 12%, and $9.8 billion, or 22%, respectively, partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $7.3 billion, or 31%.

Truist Wealth had assets under management of $209.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, up $27.3 billion, or 15%, compared to 2020 driven primarily due to favorable market performance.

Corporate and Commercial Banking

Corporate and Commercial Banking net income was $4.3 billion for 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion, or 84%, compared to 2020. Segment net interest income decreased $421 million primarily due to reduced funding credit on deposits, lower purchase accounting accretion, and a decline in average loans partially offset by higher margin fees tied to PPP loan forgiveness. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $2.2 billion which reflects allowance releases in the current year driven by an improving economic outlook compared to allowance builds in 2020 due to uncertainty regarding the pandemic as well as lower net charge offs primarily in the commercial and industrial portfolio and lower loan balances. Noninterest income increased $572 million due to strong investment banking and trading income, increased lending related fees, income from SBIC equity investments, and increased service charges on deposits slightly offset by lower operating lease income. Noninterest expense decreased $196 million primarily due to lower operating lease depreciation, lower allocated corporate expenses and reduced salary and equity based compensation expense, partially offset by higher incentives tied to performance.

Corporate and Commercial Banking average loans and leases HFI decreased $13.5 billion, or 8.1%, compared to 2020 driven primarily by lower client revolver utilization, lower dealer floor plan levels, and lower PPP.

Corporate and Commercial Banking average total deposits increased $12.8 billion, or 9.3%, compared to 2020 driven primarily by ongoing impacts of fiscal and monetary stimulus. Average noninterest-bearing deposits increased $12.3 billion, or 21%, while Interest bearing deposits increased $460 million, or 0.6%.

Insurance Holdings

Insurance Holdings net income was $508 million in 2021, an increase of $101 million, or 25%, compared to 2020. Noninterest income increased $423 million primarily due to organic growth as well as acquisitions. Impact from organic growth was $238 million, or 11%, and impact from acquisitions was $185 million, or 8%. Noninterest expense increased $295 million primarily due to commissions on higher production in the current year along with higher amortization of intangibles and operating expenses related to acquisitions.

Other, Treasury, and Corporate

Other, Treasury, and Corporate generated a net loss of $1.6 billion in 2021, compared to a net loss of $1.3 billion in 2020. Segment net interest income increased $142 million due to lower expense on borrowings and growth in the securities portfolio. The allocated provision for credit losses decreased $101 million which primarily reflects changes in the reserve for unfunded commitments as well as an allowance release in the current year resulting from the improving economic outlook. Noninterest income decreased $378 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of non-agency MBS in the same period of the prior year, partially offset by income from assets held for certain post-employment benefits. Noninterest expense increased $251 million primarily due to charitable contributions to the Truist Foundation and the Truist Charitable Fund, as well as higher incremental operating expenses related to the Merger and higher restructuring charges in the current year, partially offset by the loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt in the same period of the prior year.

Analysis of Financial Condition

Investment Activities

Truist’s Board-approved investment policy is carried out by the MRLCC, which meets regularly to review the economic environment and establish investment strategies. The MRLCC also has much broader responsibilities, which are discussed in the "Market Risk Management" section in MD&A.

Investment strategies are reviewed by the MRLCC based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and the overall interest rate sensitivity of the Company. In general, the goals of the investment portfolio are: (i) to provide sufficient liquid assets to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (ii) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds, trust deposits and other borrowings; and (iii) to earn an optimal return on funds invested commensurate with meeting the requirements of (i) and (ii) and consistent with the Company’s risk appetite.

Truist Bank invests in securities allowable under bank regulations. These securities may include obligations of the U.S. Treasury, U.S. government agencies, GSEs (including MBS), bank eligible obligations of any state or political subdivision, non-agency MBS, structured notes, bank eligible corporate obligations (including corporate debentures), commercial paper, negotiable CDs, bankers acceptances, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The securities portfolio totaled $154.6 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $120.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase was due primarily to increases in MBS and U.S. Treasury securities resulting from strong deposit growth resulting from fiscal and monetary stimulus.

As of December 31, 2021, approximately 4.6% of the securities portfolio was variable rate, excluding the impact of swaps, compared to 1.9% as of December 31, 2020. The effective duration of the securities portfolio was 5.8 years at December 31, 2021, compared to 4.0 years at December 31, 2020, excluding the impact of unsettled security purchases at period end.

U.S. Treasury, GSE, and Agency MBS represents 97% of the total securities portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and more than 99% at December 31, 2020. While the overwhelming majority of the portfolio remains in agency MBS securities, the Company purchased $4.3 billion of AAA rated non-agency MBS as the risk adjusted returns for these securities was more attractive than agency MBS.

The following table presents the securities portfolio at December 31, 2021, segregated by major category of security holdings with ranges of maturities and average yields disclosed:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Yields represent interest computed under the effective interest method on a TE basis using the federal income tax rate and the amortized cost of the securities.

(2)For purposes of the maturity table, MBS, which are not due at a single maturity date, have been included in maturity groupings based on the contractual maturity. The expected life of MBS will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay the underlying mortgage loans.

Lending Activities

Truist strives to meet the credit needs of its clients while pursuing a balanced strategy of loan profitability, loan growth, and loan quality. Management believes that this purpose can best be accomplished by building strong client relationships over time and developing in-depth local market knowledge. The Company employs strict underwriting criteria governing the degree of risk assumed and the diversity of the loan portfolio in terms of type, industry, and geographical concentration.

Truist lends to a diverse client base that is geographically dispersed to mitigate concentration risk arising from local and regional economic downturns. International loans were immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The following discussion provides additional information on the Company’s loan and lease portfolios. Refer to the "Risk Management" section for a discussion of the credit risk management policies used to manage the portfolios.

50 Truist Financial Corporation

Commercial Loan and Lease Portfolio

Commercial loans and leases represent the largest category of the Company’s loan and lease portfolio. Commercial Community Banking generally targets small-to-middle market businesses with annual sales between $2 million and $500 million, while CIB provides lending solutions to large corporate clients. The commercial loan and lease portfolio consists of lending to public and private business clients and is composed of commercial and industrial, owner occupied, equipment leasing and financing, commercial real estate, and government and institutional financing.

In accordance with the Company’s lending policy, each commercial loan undergoes a detailed underwriting process. Commercial loans are typically priced with an interest rate tied to market indices, such as the prime rate, LIBOR, or SOFR and are individually monitored and reviewed for deterioration in the ability of the client to repay the loan. The majority of Truist’s commercial loans are secured by real estate, business equipment, inventories, and other types of collateral.

Residential Mortgage Loan Portfolio

Truist primarily originates conforming mortgage loans, loans under FHA, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or U.S. Department of Agriculture programs, and higher quality jumbo and construction-to-permanent loans for 1-4 family residential properties. Conforming loans are loans that are underwritten in accordance with the underwriting standards set forth by FNMA and FHLMC. They are generally collateralized by one-to-four-family residential real estate, typically have loan-to-collateral value ratios of 80% or less at origination, or have mortgage insurance as required by investors and are made to borrowers in good credit standing.

Risks associated with mortgage lending include interest rate risk, which is mitigated through the sale of a substantial portion of conforming fixed-rate loans in the secondary mortgage market and an effective MSR hedging process. Credit risk is managed through rigorous underwriting procedures and mortgage insurance. The right to service the loans and receive servicing income is generally retained when conforming loans are sold. Management believes that the retention of mortgage servicing diversifies income while enabling Truist to build long-term client relationships and offer high quality client service. Truist also purchases residential mortgage loans from correspondent originators. The loans purchased from third party originators are subject to substantially the same underwriting and risk-management criteria as loans originated internally.

Residential Home Equity and Direct Loan Portfolio

The residential home equity and direct loan portfolio is composed of a wide variety of secured and unsecured loans offered through Truist’s branch network, as well as loans originated by LightStream, Truist’s national online consumer lending division. Loans originated through the Truist branch network include revolving home equity lines of credit secured by first or second liens on residential real estate and certain other secured and unsecured lending marketed to qualifying clients and other creditworthy candidates in Truist’s market areas. LightStream provides fixed-rate, unsecured lending to consumers with strong credit through its proprietary online loan origination system.

Indirect Auto Loan Portfolio

The indirect auto portfolio primarily includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used automobiles. The indirect auto portfolio also includes nonprime and near prime automobile finance. Such loans are originated through approved franchised and independent dealers throughout the Truist market area and nationally through Regional Acceptance Corporation. These loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. Indirect auto loans are subject to rigorous lending policies and procedures and are underwritten with note amounts and credit limits that are consistent with the Company’s risk philosophy. In addition to its normal underwriting due diligence, Truist uses application systems and scoring systems to help underwrite and manage the credit risk in its indirect auto portfolio.

Indirect Other Loan Portfolio

The indirect other portfolio includes secured indirect installment loans to consumers for the purchase of new and used boats and recreational vehicles. The indirect other portfolio also includes small ticket consumer lending related to the purchase of power sports equipment. These loans are relatively homogeneous and no single loan is individually significant in terms of its size and potential risk of loss. These loans are subject to similar rigorous lending policies and procedures as the indirect auto loan portfolio. The indirect other loan portfolio also includes other indirect and point-of-sale lending to consumers to finance home improvements, furniture purchases, certain elective health-care services, power sports, trailer, and other consumer products segments. These loans are originated in accordance with strict underwriting criteria as determined by Truist.

Truist Financial Corporation 51

Student Loan Portfolio

The student loan portfolio is primarily composed of government guaranteed student loans and additionally includes certain private student loans originated by third parties. The government guarantee mitigates substantially all of the risk related to principal and interest repayment for this component of the portfolio. Private student loans were purchased from third party originators with credit enhancements that partially mitigate the Company’s credit exposure.

Credit Card Loan Portfolio

The credit card portfolio consists of the outstanding balances on credit cards. Truist markets credit cards to its existing client base and does not solicit cardholders through nationwide programs or other forms of mass marketing. Such balances are generally unsecured and actively managed.

Refer to "Note 5. Loans and ACL" for additional information.

The following table summarizes the loan portfolio:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company reclassified the lease financing portfolio to the commercial and industrial portfolio. Prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation.

Loans and leases HFI were $289.5 billion at December 31, 2021, down $10.2 billion compared to 2020.

Commercial loans decreased $9.0 billion during 2021 primarily due to a decline of $8.7 billion in PPP loans (commercial and industrial). The carrying value of PPP loans was $2.1 billion and $10.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Excluding PPP loans, commercial and industrial loans were up $3.8 billion, or 2.9%, while CRE and commercial construction declined $2.6 billion, or 10%, and $1.5 billion, or 23%, respectively.

Consumer loans decreased $1.2 billion during 2021 primarily due to refinance activity resulting in a $998 million decline in residential home equity and direct loans and a $772 million decline in student loans due to paydowns on government guaranteed loans. This was partially offset by a $580 million increase in residential mortgages due to the strategy to put certain correspondent channel production onto the balance sheet and lower prepayments.

LHFS decreased $1.2 billion during 2021 primarily due to the sale of $1.0 billion due to the divestiture of certain businesses.

52 Truist Financial Corporation

The following table presents a summary of the loans and leases, segregated by contractual maturity of payments and interest rate terms. Determinations of maturities are based on contractual terms, except when rollovers or extensions are included for purposes of measuring the ACL. Truist’s credit policy typically does not permit automatic renewal of loans. At the scheduled maturity date (including balloon payment date), the client generally must request a new loan to replace the matured loan and execute either a new note or note modification with rate, terms and conditions negotiated at that time.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Certain residential mortgage loans have an initial period where the borrower is only required to pay the periodic interest. After the interest-only period, the loan will require the payment of both interest and principal over the remaining term. The outstanding balances of variable rate residential mortgage loans in the interest-only phase were approximately $288 million and $358 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.

Truist Financial Corporation 53

The following table presents the composition of average loans and leases:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Average loans and leases held for investment for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $286.3 billion, up $185 million, or 0.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2021. Excluding a $2.0 billion decrease in average PPP loans, average loans held for investment were up $2.2 billion, or 0.8%.

Average commercial loans decreased $1.2 billion, or 0.7%, as $1.8 billion, or 1.4%, growth within the commercial and industrial portfolio, excluding PPP, was more than offset by a $2.0 billion decrease in average PPP loans (commercial and industrial), a $628 million decrease in average commercial construction loans, and a $453 million decrease in average CRE loans.

Average consumer loans increased $1.3 billion, or 1.1%, primarily due to a $1.8 billion increase in residential mortgages due to the continued strategy to put certain correspondent channel production onto the balance sheet and lower prepayments. Student loans declined $330 million primarily due to paydowns on government guaranteed loans. Indirect other was down $134 million due to a seasonal decline in Sheffield.

Asset Quality

The following tables summarize asset quality information:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The past due status of loans that received a deferral under the CARES Act is generally frozen during the deferral period.

(2)Includes government guaranteed loans of $978 million and $787 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(3)Includes government guaranteed loans of $865 million and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Nonperforming assets totaled $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021, down $224 million compared to December 31, 2020 due to declines across almost all portfolios, partially offset by an increase in the indirect auto portfolio. Nonperforming loans and leases represented 0.38% of total loans and leases, down six basis points compared to December 31, 2020.

Truist Financial Corporation 55

Performing TDRs were up $29 million compared to the prior year.

Loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing totaled $1.9 billion at December 31, 2021, down $78 million compared to the prior year due to declines in the student portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the residential mortgage portfolio. The ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.67% at December 31, 2021, flat compared to the prior year. Excluding government guaranteed and PPP loans, the ratio of loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.03% at December 31, 2021, down one basis point from December 31, 2020.

Loans 30-89 days past due and still accruing totaled $2.0 billion at December 31, 2021, down $176 million compared to the prior year due to declines in the residential mortgage and student portfolios, partially offset by increases in the indirect auto and commercial and industrial portfolios. The ratio of loans 30-89 days or more past due and still accruing as a percentage of loans and leases was 0.71% at December 31, 2021, down three basis points compared to the prior year.

Problem loans include NPLs and loans that are 90 days or more past due and still accruing as disclosed in Table 19. In addition, for the commercial portfolio segment, loans that are rated special mention or substandard performing are closely monitored by management as potential problem loans. Refer to “Note 5. Loans and ACL” for additional disclosures related to these potential problem loans.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes LHFS.

(2)This asset quality ratio has been adjusted to remove the impact of government guaranteed mortgage, student, and PPP loans. Management believes the inclusion of such assets in this asset quality ratio results in distortion of this ratio because collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured or the ratio might not be comparable to other periods presented or to other portfolios that do not have government guarantees.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

56 Truist Financial Corporation

The following table presents activity related to NPAs:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)For 2020, includes approximately $500 million of loans previously classified as PCI that would have otherwise been nonperforming as of December 31, 2019.

(2)Includes charge-offs and losses recorded upon sale of $115 million and $139 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(3)Includes gains, net of charge-offs and losses recorded upon sale of $3 million and charge-offs and losses of $132 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

TDRs occur when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties in the near term and a concession has been granted to the borrower. As a result, Truist works with borrowers to prevent further difficulties and to improve the likelihood of recovery on a loan. To facilitate this process, a concessionary modification that would not otherwise be considered may be granted, resulting in classification of the loan as a TDR. For loan modification programs in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Truist applied the relief from TDR accounting described in the CARES Act. Payment relief assistance provided by Truist includes forbearance, deferrals, extension, and re-aging programs, along with certain other modification strategies. Refer to “Note 1. Basis of Presentation” for the policies related to TDRs and COVID-19 loan modifications. The following table provides a summary of performing TDR activity:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes scheduled principal payments, prepayments, and payoffs of amounts outstanding.

(2)Represent loans that no longer meet the requirements necessary to reflect the loan in accruing status.

The following table provides further details regarding the payment status of TDRs outstanding at December 31, 2021:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

ACL

Activity related to the ACL is presented in the following tables:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 4.07 times nonperforming loans and leases held for investment, compared to 4.39 times at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the allowance for loan and lease losses was 6.36 times annualized net charge-offs, compared to 5.21 times at December 31, 2020.

Net charge-offs during 2021 totaled $697 million, down $422 million compared to the prior year, reflecting Truist’s prudent risk culture, portfolio diversification, improving economic conditions, and the ongoing effects of government stimulus. As a percentage of average loans and leases, annualized net charge-offs were 0.24%, down 12 basis points compared to the prior year. Prior year net charge-offs include $97 million of charge-offs related to the implementation of CECL, which required a gross-up of loan carrying values in connection with the establishment of an allowance on PCD loans. Management performed a comprehensive review of PCD assets during the year and concluded in certain situations that a charge-off was required. Excluding these additional charge-offs, net charge-offs would have been an annualized 0.33% of average loans and leases for 2020.

58 Truist Financial Corporation

The following table presents an allocation of the ALLL. The entire amount of the allowance is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans and leases.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Truist monitors the performance of its home equity loans and lines secured by second liens similarly to other consumer loans and utilizes assumptions specific to these loans in determining the necessary ALLL. Truist also receives notification when the first lien holder, whether Truist or another financial institution, has initiated foreclosure proceedings against the borrower. When notified that the first lien is in the process of foreclosure, Truist obtains valuations to determine if any additional charge-offs or reserves are warranted. These valuations are updated at least annually thereafter.

Truist has limited ability to monitor the delinquency status of the first lien, unless the first lien is held or serviced by Truist. Truist estimates second lien loans where the first lien is delinquent based on historical experience; the increased risk of loss on these credits is reflected in the ALLL. As of December 31, 2021, Truist held or serviced the first lien on 30% of its second lien positions.

Other Assets

The components of other assets are presented in the following table:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Funding Activities

Deposits are the primary source of funds for the Company’s lending and investing activities. Scheduled payments and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities also provide a stable source of funds. FHLB advances, other secured borrowings, Federal funds purchased and other short-term borrowed funds, as well as long-term debt issued through the capital markets, all provide supplemental liquidity sources. Funding activities are monitored and governed through Truist’s overall ALM process under the governance and oversight of the MRLCC, which is further discussed in the "Market Risk Management" section in MD&A. The following section provides a brief description of the various sources of funds.

Truist Financial Corporation 59

Deposits

Deposits are obtained principally from individuals and businesses within Truist’s geographic area and include noninterest-bearing checking accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts, savings accounts, money market deposit accounts, CDs and IRAs. Deposit account terms vary with respect to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit and service charge schedules. Interest rates paid on specific deposit types are determined based on (i) competitor deposit rates, (ii) the anticipated amount and timing of funding needs, (iii) the availability and cost of alternative sources of funding, and (iv) anticipated future economic conditions and interest rates. Deposits are attractive sources of funding because of their stability and relative cost.

The following table presents a summary of deposits:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Deposits totaled $416.5 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $35.4 billion from December 31, 2020. The growth in deposits reflects ongoing impact of government stimulus programs. Time deposits decreased primarily due to the maturity of higher-cost personal accounts.

The following table presents average deposits:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Average deposits for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $411.0 billion, an increase of $8.2 billion, or 2.0%, compared to the prior quarter. Average noninterest bearing deposits grew 3.4% compared to the prior quarter and represented 35.6% of total deposits for the fourth quarter of 2021, compared to 35.2% for the prior quarter. Average interest checking and money market and savings grew 2.5% and 1.2%, respectively, compared to the prior quarter.

Average time deposits decreased 4.7% primarily due to the maturity of higher-cost personal accounts.

The amount of deposits above the FDIC’s limit of $250,000 was $202.5 billion and $185.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, calculated using the same methodology as the Call Report. The following table summarizes the maturities of time deposit accounts above $250,000:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

60 Truist Financial Corporation

Borrowings

The types of short-term borrowings that have been, or may be, used by the Company include Federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, master notes, commercial paper, short-term bank notes, and short-term FHLB advances. Short-term borrowings fluctuate based on the Company’s funding needs. While deposits remain the primary source for funding loan originations, management uses short-term borrowings as a supplementary funding source for loan growth and other balance sheet management purposes. The following table summarizes certain information for the past three years with respect to short-term borrowings excluding trading liabilities, hedges, and collateral in excess of derivative exposure:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2021, short-term borrowings totaled $5.3 billion, a decrease of $800 million compared to December 31, 2020, due primarily to a decrease of $2.6 billion in short-term FHLB advances, partially offset by an increase of $1.2 billion in securities sold under agreements to repurchase and a $616 million increase in trading liabilities. Average short-term borrowings were $6.2 billion or 1.4% of total funding for 2021, as compared to $10.1 billion or 2.4% for the prior year. Average short-term borrowings decreased as a percentage of funding sources due to strong deposit growth. 

Long-term debt provides funding and, to a lesser extent, regulatory capital, and primarily consists of senior and subordinated notes issued by Truist and Truist Bank. Long-term debt totaled $35.9 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $3.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020. During 2021, the Company had $7.8 billion of senior long term debt maturities and redemptions, partially offset by $2.3 billion of issuances of fixed rate senior notes with an interest rate of 1.27% to 1.89% maturing between 2027 to 2029 and issuances of $2.3 billion in variable rate senior notes maturing between 2024 and 2025. FHLB advances represented 2.4% of total outstanding long-term debt at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.2% at December 31, 2020. The average cost of long-term debt was 1.53% for the year ended December 31, 2021, down 22 basis points compared to the same period in 2020.

In February 2022, Truist announced it will redeem $300 million of fixed rate subordinated notes in February 2022 that were due in March 2022 and $1.0 billion of fixed rate senior notes and $350 million in floating rate senior notes in March 2022 that were due in April 2022.

Shareholders’ Equity

Total shareholders’ equity was $69.3 billion at December 31, 2021, a decrease of $1.6 billion from December 31, 2020. This decrease includes a decrease of $2.3 billion in AOCI, redemptions of $1.4 billion in preferred stock for Series F, G, and H, $2.9 billion in dividends, and $1.6 billion in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by $6.4 billion in net income. Truist’s book value per common share at December 31, 2021 was $47.14, compared to $46.52 at December 31, 2020.

Refer to “Note 12. Shareholders’ Equity” for additional disclosures related to preferred stock redemptions.

Risk Management

Truist maintains a comprehensive risk management framework supported by people, processes, and systems to identify, measure, monitor, manage, and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities. Effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner, and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company’s risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite.

Truist Financial Corporation 61

Truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying, measuring, responding to, monitoring, and reporting on possible exposures to the organization. The risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables Truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the Company faces, both presently and in the future, and the Company’s position on managing risk to acceptable levels.

Truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization. All teammates are responsible for upholding the Company’s purpose, mission, and values, and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the Company’s culture. The Truist code of ethics guides the Company’s decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance.

Truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations. Risk-taking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive risk-adjusted returns, while preserving asset value and capital.

Compensation decisions take into account a teammate’s adherence to and successful implementation of Truist’s risk values and associated policies and procedures. The Company’s compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risk-taking behavior.

Truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage BB&T and heritage SunTrust. The Board and Executive Leadership oversee the change management program, which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities.

Truist’s purpose, mission, and values are the foundation for the risk management framework utilized at Truist and therefore serve as the basis on which the risk appetite and risk strategy are built. Truist’s RMO provides independent oversight and guidance for risk-taking across the enterprise. In keeping with the belief that consistent values drive long-term behaviors, Truist’s RMO has established the following risk values which guide teammates’ day-to-day activities:

•Managing risk is the responsibility of every teammate.

•Proactively identifying risk and managing the inherent risks of their businesses is the responsibility of the business units.

•Managing risk with a balanced approach which includes quality, profitability, and growth.

•Measuring what is managed and managing what is measured.

•Utilizing sound and consistent risk management practices.

•Thoroughly analyzing risk quantitatively and qualitatively.

•Realizing lower cost of capital from high quality risk management.

Truist places significant emphasis on risk management oversight and maintains a separate Board-level Risk Committee, which assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s risk management function. The Committee is responsible for approving and periodically reviewing the Company’s risk management framework and risk management policies as well as monitoring the Company’s risk profile, approving risk appetite statements, and providing input to management regarding Truist’s risk appetite and risk profile.

The RMO is led by the CRO and is responsible for overseeing the identification, measurement, monitoring, management, and reporting of risk. The CRO has direct access to the Board to communicate any risk issues (current or emerging) as well as the performance of the risk management activities throughout the enterprise.

As illustrated below, the risk management framework is supported by three lines of defense. The following figure describes the roles of the three lines of defense:

62 Truist Financial Corporation

Truist’s Risk Governance framework is designed to provide comprehensive Board and Executive Leadership risk oversight, maintaining a committee governance structure that is designed to ensure alignment and execution of the risk management framework. The committee structure provides a mechanism to allow for efficient aggregation and escalation of risk information from the business units up to the risk programs, Executive Leadership and ultimately the Board.

The executive level committees include the ERC, ECRC, MRLCC, EBPCC, TMC, and DC, each of which is chaired by a member of Executive Leadership. These committees provide oversight of each of the primary risk types.

The ERC establishes a fully integrated view of risks across the company, provides broad strategic oversight of all risk types, and oversees corporate-wide strategies for identifying, assessing, controlling, measuring, monitoring, and reporting risk at the enterprise level. The ERC is responsible for maintaining an effective risk management framework and monitoring its adoption and execution across the enterprise. The ERC is chaired by the CRO and its membership includes all members of Executive Leadership and the General Auditor.

Truist Financial Corporation 63

The principal types of inherent risk include climate, market, credit, liquidity, compliance, strategic, reputational, operational, and technology risks. The following is a discussion of these risks.

Climate Risk

Climate risk includes the risks arising from a changing climate and the economic activities or trends resulting from the mitigation of climate change. These risks are classified into two categories, physical risks, resulting from acute weather events and chronic changes in climate conditions; as well as, transition risks, related to the changing economic conditions resulting from the transition to a low-carbon economy.

During 2021, Truist expanded its risk management teams and created a dedicated climate risk management function that seeks to identify and evaluate climate risks and opportunities, and integrate them into the Company’s risk management framework and strategic plans. Truist has conducted initial assessments of its exposure to various forms of climate risk including flooding, hurricane wind, and wildfire risks facing the real estate secured portfolios. Transition risks facing Truist’s commercial clients have also been evaluated against key risk drivers including, stakeholders, legal, regulatory, and technology. These risk assessments and broader climate scenario analysis will continue to be refined while climate risk related metrics are developed and incorporated into risk monitoring processes across the Company.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios, securities, or other financial instruments. Market risk results from changes in the level, volatility, or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices, including interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity, and commodity prices.

Effective management of market risk is essential to achieving Truist’s strategic financial objectives. Truist’s most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet; however, market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk, price risk, and volatility risk in Truist’s business units. Interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities (re-pricing risk); from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities (basis risk); from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and from interest-related options inherently embedded in bank products (options risk).

The primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income, net income, and capital, and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. At Truist, market risk management also includes the enterprise-wide IPV function.

Interest Rate Market Risk

As a financial institution, Truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet positions. To keep net interest margin as stable as possible, Truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities, taking into account the volumes, maturities, and mix. Truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk: (i) simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates; (ii) analysis of interest rate shock scenarios; and (iii) analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates.

The Company’s simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends, using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans, as well as scheduled maturities and payments, and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates. These assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to Truist’s assets and liabilities. The model also considers Truist’s current and prospective liquidity position, current balance sheet volumes, projected growth and/or contractions, accessibility of funds for short-term needs and capital maintenance.

Deposit betas (the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes) are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process. Truist applies deposit beta assumptions to non-maturity interest-bearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity. Non-maturity, interest-bearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity. Truist utilizes a tiered deposit beta assumption framework that accounts for historically observed behaviors of clients and the Company. The deposit beta assumptions are reduced when interest rates are exceptionally low and competition for interest-bearing deposits is commensurately low. As interest rates rise, the deposit beta assumptions also rise to reflect increasing competition among banks as well as increased client demand for interest-bearing deposits. Truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately 25% for the first 100 basis point increase in the Federal funds rate, approximately 35% for the second 100 basis point increase, and approximately 50% for any additional increases. Truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables, including noninterest-bearing deposits, to determine the impact these variables could have on the Company’s interest rate risk position. The predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions, but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk.

The following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next 12 months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The Down 25 and 50 rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect Down 25 and 50 basis points for all rate indices.

Truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the Board. The following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered Truist’s primary measures of interest rate risk:

•Maximum decrease in net interest income of 7.5% for the next 12 months assuming a 25 basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters; and a

•Maximum decrease in net interest income of 10% for the next 12 months assuming an immediate 100 basis point parallel shock change in interest rates. This interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk.

Management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix. Liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle. Much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterest-bearing demand deposits. Consistent with the industry, Truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source. The behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of Truist. A decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of Truist’s balance sheet because the Company may increase interest-bearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source. Alternatively, the Company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterest-bearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheet’s asset sensitivity.

The following table shows the results of Truist’s interest-rate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios. For purposes of this analysis, Truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at 100%.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at December 31, 2021 as presented in the preceding table.

Truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities, commercial loans, MSRs, and mortgage banking operations, long-term debt, and other funding sources. Truist hedges a portion of its AFS securities to reduce mark-to-market volatility within AOCI and also to increase its overall asset sensitivity position. Truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities. As of December 31, 2021, Truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling $300.6 billion, with an associated net fair value of $1.8 billion. See “Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments” for additional disclosures.

LIBOR Transition

LIBOR in its current form will no longer be available after 2021. For most tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, the administrator of LIBOR extended publication until June 30, 2023. Tenors used infrequently by Truist, including one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR and all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR, ceased publication at December 31, 2021, based on the October 20, 2021 interagency Joint Statement on Managing the LIBOR transition. To prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate, management formed a cross-functional project team to address the LIBOR transition. The project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from LIBOR to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to Executive Leadership and the Board. As of December 2021, Truist had outstanding LIBOR-based instruments that mature after June 30, 2023, including: loan and lease exposures totaling approximately $151 billion, notional derivative exposure totaling approximately $131 billion, long-term debt of $1.1 billion, and preferred stock of $1.5 billion. These amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts, which contain adequate fallback language for the transition.

Contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from LIBOR. For impacted lines of business, the Company has started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language. Current fallback language used for new, renewed, and modified contracts is generally consistent with ARRC recommendations and includes use of “hardwired fallback” language, where appropriate.

The progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement. For commercial lending and general consumer lending, a significant number of remaining LIBOR contracts will require client outreach and remediation. Efforts to amend and remediate contracts, excluding mortgage and student loans, that mature post June 30, 2023 ($141 billion) will be accelerated in 2022. Truist has determined that adjustable rate mortgage products ($4.3 billion) have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from LIBOR in line with industry expectations; therefore, these contracts will not require remediation. Remediation of student loans ($6.1 billion) will depend on guidance from the Department of Education and recent guidance from the CFPB to allow transition to “comparable rates,” including SOFR or Prime. Derivatives will utilize recent New York legislation to support transition of trades to follow the ISDA Protocol (where counterparties have not already adhered to the protocol). Truist will evaluate legislation being considered in 2022 to further support the transition away from LIBOR. This legislation may provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language.

Training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during 2022. Truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during 2022 and the first half of 2023. Truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments, systems implications, hedging strategies, and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition.

As of December 31, 2021, Truist ceased entering into new contracts with a LIBOR reference rate for all product offerings, except on a limited basis, as permissible. Market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions as of the transition. The Company is actively using SOFR as a reference rate and has originated approximately $18.3 billion of loans, issued $5.0 billion of long-term debt, and has $44.9 billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of December 31, 2021. Truist expects SOFR to become a more commonly-used pricing benchmark across the industry and will continue to offer additional SOFR based products during 2022. Additional alternative reference rates, such as Bloomberg Short Term Bank Yield will be supported based on market demand. Other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for LIBOR based on market developments. For a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of LIBOR and the transition to alternative reference rates, refer to the section titled “Item1A. Risk Factors.”

Market risk from trading activities

As a financial intermediary, Truist provides its clients access to derivatives, foreign exchange and securities markets, which generate market risks. Trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach, which includes measuring risk using VaR, stress testing, and sensitivity analysis. Risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level, which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with Truist’s risk appetite.

Truist is also subject to risk-based capital guidelines for market risk under the Market Risk Rule.

66 Truist Financial Corporation

Covered Trading Positions

Covered positions subject to the Market Risk Rule include trading assets and liabilities, specifically those held for the purpose of short-term resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected short-term price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits. Truist’s trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the Company’s clients, as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity. The trading portfolio, measured in terms of VaR, consists primarily of four sub-portfolios of covered positions: (i) credit trading, (ii) fixed income securities, (iii) interest rate derivatives, and (iv) equity derivatives. As a market maker across different asset classes, Truist’s trading portfolio also contains other sub-portfolios, including foreign exchange, loan trading, and commodity derivatives; however, these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures.

Valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions. Additionally, these positions are subject to independent price verification. See “Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments,” “Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures,” and “Critical Accounting Policies” herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies.

Securitizations

As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate market value of on-balance sheet securitization positions subject to the Market Risk Rule was $51 million, all of which were non-agency asset backed securities positions. Consistent with the Market Risk Rule requirements, the Company performs pre-purchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including, but not limited to, deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets, that materially affect valuation and performance. Securitization positions are subject to Truist’s comprehensive risk management framework, which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits. There were no off-balance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period.

Correlation Trading Positions

The trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of December 31, 2021.

VaR-Based Measures

VaR measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon. Truist utilizes a historical VaR methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions. For risk management purposes, the VaR calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a one-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level. For Market Risk Rule purposes, the Company calculates VaR using a 10-day holding period and a 99% confidence level. Due to inherent limitations of the VaR methodology, such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance, VaR is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk. Other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing, scenario analysis, and stop loss limits.

The trading portfolio’s VaR profile is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and composition of the portfolio, market volatility, and the correlation between different positions. A portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual sub-portfolios, because, under normal market conditions, risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories. The following table summarizes certain VaR-based measures for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. During 2021, average one and ten day VaR measures declined from last year as heightened market volatility experienced during March 2020 aged out of the 12-month VaR look-back window.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Truist Financial Corporation 67

Stressed VaR-based measures

Stressed VaR, another component of market risk capital, is calculated using the same internal models as used for the VaR-based measure. Stressed VaR is calculated over a ten-day holding period at a one-tail, 99% confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelve-month historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the Company’s trading portfolio. The following table summarizes Stressed VaR-based measures:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compared to the prior year, stressed VaR measures increased in 2021 primarily due to the normalization of market making inventory levels this year compared to 2020 when inventory levels were lower due to the market volatility.

Specific Risk Measures

Specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements (e.g. default, event risks). The Market Risk Rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a model-based approach, subject to regulatory approval. Truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital. As such, incremental risk capital requirements do not apply.

VaR Model Backtesting

In accordance with the Market Risk Rule, the Company evaluates the accuracy of its VaR model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses (excluding fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income, and intraday trading) from covered positions with the corresponding daily VaR-based measures generated by the model. As illustrated in the following graph, there were no Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The total number of Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the VaR-based capital requirement under the Market Risk Rule. The capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four, depending on the number of exceptions. All Company-wide VaR backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of VaR model use and performance. There was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months.

Model Risk Management

MRM is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models. The validation activities are conducted in accordance with MRM policy, which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness, ongoing monitoring, and outcomes analysis. As part of ongoing monitoring efforts, the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets, assess evolving modeling approaches, and to identify potential model enhancement.

Stress Testing

The Company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily VaR and other risk limits reporting. The stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme, but plausible, stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses. Stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks. All trading positions within each applicable market risk category (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange rate risk, credit spread risk, and commodity price risk) are included in the Company’s comprehensive stress testing framework. Management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates, as necessary, which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately. Management also utilizes stress analyses to support the Company’s capital adequacy assessment standards. See the “Capital” section of MD&A for additional discussion of capital adequacy.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default, inability or unwillingness of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to Truist or otherwise perform as agreed. Credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower, obligor, or counterparty. Credit risk arises when Truist funds are extended, committed, invested, or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements, whether on or off-balance sheet. Credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates.

Truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk:

•limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower;

•establishing a process for credit approval accountability;

•careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower, transaction, market and collateral risks;

•ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships;

•continuous monitoring of the portfolio, market dynamics and the economy; and

•periodically reevaluating the Company’s strategy and overall exposure as economic, market and other relevant conditions change.

The following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of Truist’s lending function.

Underwriting Approach

The loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk; therefore, proper loan underwriting is critical to Truist’s long-term financial success. Truist’s underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific risk-mitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to Truist’s risk philosophy. Provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals:

•Cash flow and debt service coverage - cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness, meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrower's cash flow or, if not, must be justified by secondary repayment sources.

•Secondary sources of repayment - alternative repayment funds are a significant risk-mitigating factor as long as they are liquid, can be easily accessed, and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source.

•Value of any underlying collateral - loans are generally secured by the asset being financed. Because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor, collateral, unless it is liquid, does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrower's normal cash flows.

•Overall creditworthiness of the client, taking into account the client's relationships, both past and current, with Truist and other lenders - Truist’s success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients, which involves assessing their financial position and background.

•Level of equity invested in the transaction - in general, borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances.

Refer to the "Lending Activities" section in MD&A for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio.

Truist Financial Corporation 69

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that (i) Truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding (funding liquidity risk), or (ii) Truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions (market liquidity risk). Refer to the "Liquidity” section in MD&A for additional discussion.

Compliance Risk

Compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or from non-conformance with prescribed practices, internal policies and procedures or ethical standards. This risk exposes Truist to fines, civil monetary penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts. Compliance risk can result in diminished reputation, reduced franchise or enterprise value, limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk is the risk of financial loss, diminished stakeholder confidence, or negative impact to human capital resulting from ineffective strategy setting and execution, adverse business decisions, or lack of responsiveness to changes in the banking industry and operating environment. Truist is committed to fulfilling its overall strategic objectives by selecting business strategies and operating businesses in a manner consistent with achieving profitability/earnings growth and maintaining strong confidence and trust with its key stakeholder constituencies.

Reputation Risk

Reputation risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, enterprise value, the Truist brand, and public confidence arising from negative publicity or public opinion, whether real or perceived, regarding Truist’s business practices, products, services, transactions, or other activities undertaken by Truist, its representatives, or its partners. A negative reputation may impair Truist’s relationship with clients, teammates, communities, or shareholders, and it is often a residual risk that arises when other risks are not managed properly.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events. It includes legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions, litigation or claims made, or the failure to adequately protect company-owned assets. An operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk.

Model Risk

Model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Truist uses models for many purposes, including the valuation of financial positions, estimation of credit losses, and the measurement of risk. Valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available. Valuation models are also used as inputs for VaR, the estimation of VaR itself, regulatory capital, stress testing, and the ACL. Models are owned by the applicable BUs, who are responsible for the development, implementation, and use of their models. Oversight of these functions is performed by the MRM, which is a component of the RMO. Once models have been approved, model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis. Models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition, industry and economic conditions, technological capabilities and other developments.

MRM manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities. The risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers. Additionally, MRM maintains an enterprise-wide model inventory containing relevant model information. Regarding model validation, MRM utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development, implementation, and conceptual soundness. On certain occasions, the MRM will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts. Once in a production environment, MRM assesses a model’s performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews. MRM tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring, and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation. MRM gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators, which are periodically reported to relevant committees, including but not limited to, the Model Risk Management Committee as well as the Board Risk Committee. MRM will also present model risk topics to the Board Risk Committee as necessary.

Technology Risk

Technology risk is the business risk associated with the use, ownership, operation, involvement, influence, and adoption of information technology across the Company. Truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy, program, and oversight and defines key objectives, operating model components, risk domains, and capabilities to manage this risk.

Merger Integration Risk

The Truist Merger Program was designed to ensure successful integration following the Merger through strong governance practices and controls, with processes, metrics and reporting exemplifying a strong risk culture. The core Truist Merger Program structure consists of key stakeholders from each line of business. Integration activities and risk mitigation are monitored through established workgroups and Truist Merger Program leadership, with oversight and escalation into the Merger Oversight Committee (as the primary committee), TMC, and Board Technology Committee.

Cybersecurity Risk

The technology landscape is constantly evolving, and new and unforeseen threats and actions by others may disrupt operations or result in losses beyond Truist’s risk control thresholds. Truist maintains a comprehensive risk-based information security / cybersecurity framework implemented through people, processes, and technology whereby Truist actively monitors and evaluates threats, events, and the performance of its business operations and continually adapts its risk mitigation activities accordingly.

Truist’s framework aligns with those of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Standards Organization 27000 series, the IT Governance Institute, and the Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology, as well as conforms with the requirements and guidance from applicable regulatory authorities, including the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. In addition, Truist’s framework, which includes internally and externally focused capabilities, drives the development and implementation of Truist’s data security strategy that is designed to reduce risk while enabling Truist’s corporate business objectives.

Truist has built an organization with dedicated, skilled talent to operationalize Truist’s cybersecurity strategy. The cybersecurity strategy is enabled by continuous enhancement of Truist’s multilayered defenses including advanced capabilities for early and rapid cyber threat identification, detection, protection, response, and recovery. Truist participates in the federally recognized Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center as a key part of the Company’s cyber threat intelligence and response programs, as well as other industry organizations and initiatives that promote industry best practices such as harmonized cybersecurity standards, cyber readiness, and secure consumer financial data sharing.

To further mitigate the risks presented by an evolving cyber threat landscape, Truist provides data protection guidance to clients and promotes data protection awareness and accountability through mandatory teammate training. Truist conducts scenario-driven test exercises simulating impacts and consequences developed through analysis of real-world technology incidents as well as known and anticipated cyber threats. These exercises are designed to assess the viability of Truist’s crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement.

Truist’s cybersecurity risk program is overseen by Executive Leadership and the Board. Regular updates on the status of the cybersecurity risk program, including information security risks and incidents, emerging threats, and control environment, are aggregated and escalated to Executive Leadership and the Board. Additionally, Truist has a Cyber Incident Response Team that manages significant cyber-specific events with escalation up to Executive Leadership and the Board. Truist’s framework requires annual exercises at a minimum to test Truist’s preparedness. The Board devotes significant time and attention to its oversight of cyber security risk and approves related information security policies. Although Truist has invested substantial resources to manage and reduce cybersecurity risk, it is not possible to completely eliminate this risk. Truist obtains insurance that protects against certain losses, expenses, and damages associated with cybersecurity risk. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for additional information regarding cybersecurity risk.

Liquidity

Liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs, including deposit withdrawals, repayment of borrowings and other liabilities, and funding of loan commitments. In addition to the level of liquid assets, such as cash, cash equivalents, and AFS securities, other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs, including access to a variety of funding sources, maintaining borrowing capacity, growing core deposits, loan repayment, and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale.

Truist Financial Corporation 71

Truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions. In considering its liquidity position, management evaluates Truist’s funding mix based on client core funding, client rate-sensitive funding, and national markets funding. In addition, management evaluates exposure to rate-sensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less. Management also measures liquidity needs against 30 days of stressed cash outflows for Truist and Truist Bank. To ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements, management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities.

Internal Liquidity Stress Testing

Liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that Truist and Truist Bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institution-specific and market-wide adverse scenarios. Each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons. The types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition, contractual maturities, reductions in unsecured and secured funding, and increased draws on unfunded commitments. To mitigate liquidity outflows, Truist has identified sources of liquidity; however, access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment.

Truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cash-flow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. The liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and Truist’s liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as HQLA under the LCR Rule.

Contingency Funding Plan

Truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments, particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction. This plan is designed to examine and quantify the organization's liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plan’s reliability. Additionally, the plan provides a framework for management and other critical teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event. The plan addresses authority for activation and decision making, liquidity options, and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction.

LCR and HQLA

The LCR rule requires that Truist and Truist Bank maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of calculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered HQLA that satisfy operational requirements of the LCR rule. Truist and Truist Bank are subject to the Category III reduced LCR requirements. Truist held average weighted eligible HQLA of $86.7 billion and Truist’s average LCR was 114% for the three months ended December 31, 2021.

Effective July 2021, Truist became subject to final rules implementing the NSFR, which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable, long-term funding profile in relation to their asset composition and off-balance sheet activities. At December 31, 2021, the Company was compliant with this requirement.

Sources of Funds

Management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet Truist’s on- and off-balance sheet obligations. Truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits, secured and unsecured capital markets funding, and shareholders’ equity. Truist Bank’s primary source of funding is client deposits. Continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of Truist Bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested.

Truist Bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements. These sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes, institutional CDs, overnight and term Federal funds markets, and retail brokered CDs. Truist Bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including FHLB advances, repurchase agreements, and the FRB discount window. The following table presents a summary of Truist Bank’s available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the FRB:

72 Truist Financial Corporation

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2021, Truist Bank’s available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately 14.2 times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in one-year or less.

Parent Company

The Parent Company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries. The Parent Company’s assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with Truist Bank, equity investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, and notes receivable from subsidiaries. The principal obligations of the Parent Company are payments on long-term debt. The main sources of funds for the Parent Company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries, repayments of advances to subsidiaries, and proceeds from the issuance of equity and long-term debt. The primary uses of funds by the Parent Company are investments in subsidiaries, advances to subsidiaries, dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders, repurchases of common stock, and payments on long-term debt. See “Note 22. Parent Company Financial Information” for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions.

Access to funding at the Parent Company is more sensitive to market disruptions. Therefore, Truist prudently manages cash levels at the Parent Company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments, debt service, common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities, without the benefit of any new cash inflows. Truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows. In determining the buffer, Truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends, unfunded commitments to affiliates, serving as a source of strength to Truist Bank, and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Parent Company had 35 months and 43 months, respectively, of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows, and 19 months and 22 months, respectively, when including the payment of common stock dividends.

Credit Ratings

Credit ratings are forward-looking opinions of rating agencies as to the Company’s ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance. Credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets. The Company’s credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time. As Truist seeks to maintain high-quality credit ratings, management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and business updates and to discuss current outlooks and trends. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors," for additional information regarding factors that influence credit ratings and potential risks that could materialize in the event of downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings.

The following table presents the credit ratings and outlooks of Truist and Truist Bank as of December 31, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Truist Financial Corporation 73

Recent changes in the Company’s credit ratings and outlooks include:

•On May 7, 2021, Fitch Ratings affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised the ratings outlook to “stable” from “negative” based on the view that the Company’s diverse business model and solid strategy execution will drive stable earnings performance, and on increased confidence in a U.S. economic recovery.

•On May 24, 2021, S&P Global Ratings affirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised its ratings outlook to “positive” from “stable,” citing stabilization in U.S. economic trends and the easing of industry risk in the U.S. banking system, and noting that the merger of equals provides better diversity and market position, and could generate higher earnings power, financial flexibility, and technology, providing the Company with a sustainable competitive advantage.

•On June 10, 2021, DBRS Morningstar confirmed the ratings of Truist and Truist Bank and revised the trend for all ratings to “positive” from “stable”, reflecting the Company’s substantial progress with the merger integration and the view that the impact of the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic will continue to be manageable.

•On July 12, 2021, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded Truist Bank’s long-term subordinated debt rating to A2 from A3, and downgraded Truist Bank’s long-term bank deposit rating to Aa3 from Aa2, following revisions to Moody’s advanced loss given failure analysis that were published in its updated Banks methodology on July 9, 2021.

•On December 7, 2021, Moody’s Investors Service released ESG Issuer Profile Scores (IPS) and Credit Impact Scores (CIS) to assist in demonstrating the impact of ESG on credit ratings. IPS assess an issuer’s exposure to the risk categories in Moody’s ESG classification system from a credit perspective. CIS indicate the extent to which ESG factors impacted the issuer’s credit ratings. Consistent with most other banks, Truist was assigned an IPS of E-3, S-4, and G-2, and a CIS of CIS-2, the latter indicating that ESG attributes had a neutral-to-low impact on Truist’s current ratings.

•On January 19, 2022, S&P Global Ratings published Truist’s assigned ESG Credit Indicators of E-2, S-2, and G-2, which were consistent with the scores assigned to most other banks and which indicated that environmental, social and governance factors have “no material influence” on the rating agency’s analysis of the Company.

Management believes current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet Truist’s current requirements and plans for continued growth. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.9 billion in obligations to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. Many of the purchase obligations have terms that are not fixed and determinable and are included in the total amount of obligations based upon the estimated timing and amount of payment. In addition, certain of the purchase agreements contain clauses that would allow Truist to cancel the agreement with specified notice; however, that impact is not included in determining the total amount of obligations. See "Note 9. Other Assets and Liabilities," "Note 11. Borrowings," and "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies" for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations.

Capital

The maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis. Truist’s principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support Truist’s risk profile consistent with the Board-approved risk appetite, provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs, comply with relevant laws, regulations, and supervisory guidance, achieve optimal credit ratings for Truist and its subsidiaries, remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries, and provide a competitive return to shareholders. Risk-based capital ratios, which include CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and risk-weighted assets.

Truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the Company’s capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators. Management regularly monitors the capital position of Truist on both a consolidated and bank-level basis. In this regard, management’s overriding policy is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital targets, which are above the regulatory “well capitalized” minimums. Management evaluates whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above minimums specified by the FRB for the annual CCAR process. Breaches of minimum targets prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in Truist’s capital plan.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated. In addition, management closely monitors the Parent Company’s double leverage ratio (investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders' equity). The active management of the subsidiaries' equity capital is the process used to manage this important driver of Parent Company liquidity and is a key element in the management of Truist’s capital position.

Management intends to maintain capital at Truist Bank at levels that will result in classification as "well-capitalized" for regulatory purposes. Secondarily, it is management's intent to maintain Truist Bank's capital at levels that result in regulatory risk-based capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size, complexity, and risk profile. If the capital levels of Truist Bank increase above these guidelines, excess capital may be transferred to the Parent Company in the form of special dividend payments, subject to regulatory and other operating considerations.

Management's capital deployment plan in order of preference is to focus on (i) organic growth, (ii) dividends, and (iii) strategic opportunities and/or share repurchases depending on opportunities in the marketplace and Truist’s interest and ability to proceed with acquisitions.

Truist Bank's capital ratios are presented in the following table:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Truist’s capital ratios are presented in the following table:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Tangible common equity and related measures are non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of intangible assets, net of deferred taxes, and their related amortization. These measures are useful for evaluating the performance of a business consistently, whether acquired or developed internally. Truist’s management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and returns relative to balance sheet risk. These capital measures are not necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.

Truist’s capital level at December 31, 2021 remains strong compared to the regulatory levels for well capitalized banks. Truist’s CET1 ratio was 9.6% as of December 31, 2021. The decline compared to the 2020 CET1 ratio reflects capital deployed through the acquisitions of Service Finance, LLC and Constellation Affiliated Partners, the repurchase of common stock, and loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 driving an increase in risk-weighted assets. Truist increased common dividends 7% to $0.48 per share starting in the third quarter of 2021. During 2021, Truist paid $2.5 billion in common stock dividends or $1.86 per share, and repurchased $1.6 billion of common stock. Truist also redeemed $1.4 billion of preferred stock to optimize the Company’s capital position. The dividend payout ratio for 2021 was 41% compared to 58% for the prior year. The total payout ratio for 2021 was 68% compared to 58% for the prior year, reflecting the resumption of share repurchases during the year. In early 2022, Truist declared common dividends of $0.48 per share for the first quarter of 2022, and announced the acquisition of Kensington Vanguard National Land Services to expand IH’s title insurance operation.

Reclassifications

In certain circumstances, reclassifications have been made to prior period information to conform to the current presentation. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders' equity or net income. Refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for additional discussion regarding reclassifications.

Critical Accounting Policies

The accounting and reporting policies of Truist are in accordance with GAAP and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. The financial position and results of operations are affected by management's application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position and/or consolidated results of operations and related disclosures. Understanding Truist’s accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. Accordingly, Truist’s significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation."

The following is a summary of Truist’s critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates, assumptions, and judgments. These critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors on a periodic basis.

ACL

Truist’s ACL represents management's best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and off-balance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date. Estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and management’s judgement. The models are designed to forecast probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience. The models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics. The macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years. Beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to long-term historical loss conditions over a one year period. As a means of addressing uncertainty related to future economic conditions, the quantitative allowance includes an adjustment that reflects model output calculated using a range of potential future economic conditions. Expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity, giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a TDR.

A qualitative allowance which incorporates management’s judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses, including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with management’s expectations with respect to expected credit losses. This allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions, and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks, the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models.

Management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process. Under the range of scenarios considered as of December 31, 2021, use of the Company’s pessimistic scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately $2.1 billion. This estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario.

The Company individually evaluates expected credits losses related to loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and loans that have been classified as a TDR. For individually evaluated loans, the ALLL is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral, if any, while for TDRs, default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the ALLL.

The methodology used to determine an estimate for the RUFC is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the ALLL and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable. The RUFC is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments, including the probability of funding and exposure at default. A detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the ACL is included in "Note 1. Basis of Presentation."

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments. Refer to "Note 18. Fair Value Disclosures" for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and "Note 2. Business Combinations" for additional disclosures regarding business combinations.

Securities

Truist generally utilizes a third-party pricing service in determining the fair value of its AFS investment securities, whereas trading securities are priced internally. Fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from market-based pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields, benchmark securities, reported trades, offers, bids, issuer spreads, and broker quotes. Management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the third-party service provider. These procedures, which are performed independent of the responsible business unit, include comparison of pricing information received from the third party pricing service to other third-party pricing sources, review of additional information provided by the third-party pricing service and other third-party sources for selected securities and back-testing to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the third-party pricing service. The Enterprise Valuation Committee, which provides oversight to Truist’s enterprise-wide IPV function, is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the third-party pricing service or internally to other third-party pricing sources, approving tolerance limits determined by IPV for price comparison exceptions, reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hard-to-price securities. When market observable data is not available, which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities, the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions.

MSRs

Truist’s primary class of MSRs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages. Residential MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. While sales of MSRs do occur, the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available. Accordingly, Truist estimates the fair value of residential MSRs using a stochastic OAS valuation model to project residential MSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios, which are then discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The OAS model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually-specified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, late charges, other ancillary revenue, costs to service and other economic factors. Truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the OAS model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential MSR asset.

Fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys, recent market activity, actual portfolio experience and, when available, observable market data. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, residential MSRs are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy. The value of residential MSRs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace, which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds. In general, during periods of declining interest rates, the value of MSRs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage-refinance activity. Conversely, during periods of rising interest rates, the value of residential MSRs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity. Truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential MSRs. Refer to "Note 8. Loan Servicing" for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in management's assumptions would have on the fair value of residential MSRs.

LHFS

Truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value. The fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. Changes in the fair value are recorded as components of Residential mortgage income and Commercial mortgage income, while the related origination costs are generally recognized in Personnel expense when incurred. The changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the LHFS. Truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans. LHFS also includes certain loans, generally carried at LOCOM, where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale. Adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value, up to the original carrying amount, and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income. The fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available. When observable market prices are not available, the Company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value. Refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for further description of the Company’s accounting for LHFS.

Trading Loans

Truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose. Specifically, loans included within this classification include trading loans that are (i) purchased in connection with the Company’s TRS business, (ii) part of the loan sales and trading business within the C&CB segment, or (iii) backed by the SBA. Refer to "Note 16. Commitments and Contingencies," and "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments," for further discussion of the Company’s TRS business. The loans purchased in connection with the Company’s TRS and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a third party pricing service. SBA loans are fully guaranteed by the U.S. government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value.

Derivative Assets and Liabilities

Truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions. Truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit. In addition, certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to Truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits. The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates, foreign exchange, equity, and credit. The fair value of interest rate lock commitments, which are related to mortgage loan commitments, is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that Truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee. Refer to "Note 19. Derivative Financial Instruments" for further information on the Company’s derivatives.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values. This often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, which are inherently subjective. The amortization of definite-lived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. Business combinations also typically result in goodwill, which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates. Refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" for a description of the impairment testing process.

At December 31, 2021, Truist’s reporting units with goodwill balances were CB&W, C&CB, and IH. Management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of October 1 or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value. For its annual impairment review, Truist elected to perform a quantitative test of each of its reporting units. The quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and market based approaches, weighted 50% and 50%, respectively. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis. The market based approaches utilize comparable public company information, key valuation multiples, and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit, and guideline transactions, when applicable.

The inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations, including projections of future cash flows, discount rates, applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information, and guideline transaction information. Truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time, including consideration of historic bank control premiums and the current market.

Multi-year financial forecasts are developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin, expected credit losses, noninterest income, noninterest expense, and required capital. Of these inputs, the projection of net interest margin is the most significant to the financial projections of the CB&W and C&CB reporting units. The long-term growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was 3% as of October 1, 2021, based on management's assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit. Discount rates are estimated based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model, which considers the risk-free interest rate, market risk premium, beta, and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit. The discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit. The discount rates utilized for the CB&W, C&CB, and IH reporting units as of October 1, 2021 were 11%, 10%, and 10%, respectively.

Based on the Company’s annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of October 1, it was determined for the CB&W, C&CB, and IH reporting units that the respective reporting unit's fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of October 1, 2021, therefore goodwill is considered not impaired for the CB&W, C&CB, and IH reporting units. None of the reporting units of the Company had a fair value that exceeded the respective carrying value by less than 10%.

78 Truist Financial Corporation

The Company also performs sensitivity analyses around these assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions, and the resulting estimated fair values. While the Company’s sensitivity analyses did not indicate risk of impairment as of October 1. 2021, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. Additionally, a reporting unit's carrying value could change based on market conditions, asset growth, or the risk profile of those reporting units, which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value.

The Company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of 2021, concluding that it was not more-likely-than-not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of December 31, 2021.

Income Taxes

Truist is subject to income tax laws of the U.S., its states, and the municipalities in which the Company conducts business. In estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future, the Company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes, regulations, judicial precedent, and other pertinent information. The income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions, including evaluating uncertain tax positions. Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance, the status of examinations by the tax authorities, and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions. These changes, when they occur, impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results. Truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available.

Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. Such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from NOL and tax credit carryforwards. The Company regularly evaluates the ability to realize DTAs, recognizing a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the DTA will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary, the Company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws, as well as estimates of future pre-tax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented. Truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards. For additional income tax information, refer to "Note 1. Basis of Presentation" and "Note 14. Income Taxes."

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates. Calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions, which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used. The discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an AA Above Median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations.

Management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense. For the Company’s qualified plans, a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately $23 million for 2022, while a decrease of 100 basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately $166 million in pension expense for 2022. Refer to "Note 15. Benefit Plans" for disclosures related to the benefit plans.
