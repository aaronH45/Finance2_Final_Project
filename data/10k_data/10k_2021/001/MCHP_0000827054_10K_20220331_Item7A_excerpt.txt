Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As of March 31, 2022, our long-term debt totaled $7.84 billion. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $6.44 billion as of March 31, 2022. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $1.40 billion of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of March 31, 2022. A 50-basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $7.0 million.
