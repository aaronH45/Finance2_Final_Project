Industry Overview

Our addressable market includes non-portable luminaires as defined by the National Electrical Manufacturers Association; poles for outdoor lighting; emergency lighting fixtures and lighting equipment; daylighting; lighting controls; HVAC controls; and building technology controls, software, and systems. We expect that the industry’s addressable market is likely to expand due to the benefits and value creation provided by our intelligent building platform services and location-aware and asset tracking applications.

We operate in a highly competitive industry that is affected by a number of general business and economic factors, such as, but not limited to, gross domestic product growth, employment levels, credit availability, interest rates and inflation, building costs, freight, construction-related labor availability, building occupancy rates, imports and trade, energy costs, freight costs, and commodity costs (including tariffs) and availability. Our market is based on non-residential and residential construction, both new as well as renovation and retrofit activity, which may be impacted by these general economic factors. Precise segmentation of the market by new construction and renovation activity is not available, though internal estimates based on third-party data estimate the size of the markets to be about the same. Non-residential construction spending on commercial, institutional, industrial, and infrastructure projects has a material impact on the demand for our lighting and building technology solutions. Demand for our residential lighting products is highly dependent on economic drivers, such as consumer spending and discretionary income, along with housing construction and home improvement spending.

Our market is influenced by evolving technologies. This evolution includes: the development of new or improved lighting technologies, including solid-state lighting, electronic drivers, embedded lighting controls, and more effective optical designs and lamps; federal, state, and local requirements for updated energy codes; design strategies and technologies addressing sustainability and facilitating intelligent buildings; and incentives by federal, state, and local municipal authorities, as well as utility companies, for using more energy-efficient lighting and building technology solutions. We are a leading provider of integrated lighting and building technology solutions based on these technologies and utilize internally developed, licensed, or acquired intellectual property. Solid-state lighting and digital building technology systems can be converged allowing for an optimal local operating system to increase efficiency and reduce costs while also delivering productivity benefits. 

Competition

We experience competition based on numerous factors, including product vitality, service capabilities, price, brand name recognition, product quality, product and system design, energy efficiency, and customer relationships. The market for lighting and building technology services and solutions is competitive and continues to evolve through acquisition and consolidation activities. New entrants continue to develop capabilities and solutions that are both complementary as well as competitive to those of traditional industry participants. Additionally, the market for artificial intelligence and software solutions is active with a wide range of competitors, from existing large companies to startup organizations. Certain global and more diversified manufacturers may provide a broader product offering utilizing electrical, lighting, and building technology products and services as well as pricing benefits from the bundling of various offerings. In addition, there are competitors, including Asian importers, small startup companies, and global electronics, technology, and software companies, offering competing solutions, sometimes deploying different technologies.

Regulations

We are subject to various federal, state, and local laws and regulations that impose increasingly complex, stringent and costly compliance activities. These regulations include but are not limited to, the Clean Water Act; the Safe Harbor data privacy program between the U.S. and European Union; the United States-Mexico-Canada-Free Trade Agreement (“USMCA”); regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration agency (“OSHA”); the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation; California’s Consumer Privacy Act and Connected Device Privacy Act; the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”); and the U.K. Bribery Act.

On an ongoing basis, we allocate resources, including investments in capital and operating costs, to comply with laws and regulations. We do not currently believe that the costs of complying with government regulations have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. However, we may be affected by current or future standards, laws, or regulations, including those imposed in response to energy, substances in or components in or used in the manufacturing of our products, climate change, product functionality, geopolitical, corporate social responsibility, employee health and safety, privacy, or similar concerns. These standards, laws, or regulations may impact our costs of operation, the sourcing of raw materials, and the manufacture and distribution of our products and services. They may also place restrictions and other requirements or impediments on the 

3
products and solutions we can sell in certain geographical locations or may impact the willingness of certain investors to own our shares. See Part I. Item 1a. Risk Factors for additional information.

Raw Materials

Our production requires raw materials, including certain grades of steel and aluminum, electrical and electronic components, plastics, and other petroleum-based materials and components. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of materials, freight, tariffs, and duties on certain materials, particularly imports from Asia, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components, and sourced finished goods.

We do not currently engage in significant commodity hedging transactions for raw materials, though we have and will continue to commit to purchase certain materials generally for a period of up to 12 months. We monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including, but not limited to, quality, service, and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness and availability of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers.

Intellectual Property

We own or have licenses to use various domestic and foreign patents, trademarks, and other intellectual property related to our products, processes, and businesses. These intellectual property rights are important factors for our businesses. We rely on copyright, patent, trade secret, and trademark laws as well as agreements, restrictive covenants, and internal processes and controls to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these protections, unauthorized parties may attempt to infringe on our intellectual property. As of August 31, 2022, we had approximately 2,700 total patent assets including issued United States and foreign patents as well as pending United States and foreign patent applications. While patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to our competitive position, no single patent or patent application is individually material to us.

Seasonality and Cyclicality

Our business exhibits some seasonality, with net sales being affected by weather and seasonal demand on construction and installation programs, particularly during the winter months, as well as the annual budget cycles of major customers. Because of these seasonal factors we historically have experienced our highest sales in the last two quarters of each fiscal year; however, in the prior years presented our seasonality was meaningfully impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our lighting and building technology solutions are sold to customers in both the new construction as well as renovation and retrofit markets for residential and non-residential applications. The construction market is cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions and fiscal policies. Sales volume has a major impact on our profitability. Economic downturns and the potential decline in key construction markets may have a material adverse effect on our net sales, operating income, financial position, and cash flows.

The COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in intermittent worldwide government restrictions on the movement of people, goods, and services resulting in increased volatility in and disruptions to global markets. We remain committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our associates and their families and ensuring that we operate effectively. We have implemented various health and safety policies and processes at our facilities in the United States, Mexico, Canada, and other locations as permitted by law. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our results of operations. The pandemic has caused reduced construction and renovation spending as well as a disruption in our supply chain for certain components, both of which negatively impacted our operating results. Although our facilities are open, a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, including as a result of new variants, may lead to the reimposition of previously lifted business closure requirements, the imposition of new restrictions, or the issuance of new or revised local or national health guidance. We also continue to incur additional health and safety costs including expenditures for personal protection equipment and facility enhancements to maintain proper distancing guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies. We have taken actions to reduce costs, including the realignment of headcount with current volumes, a limit on all non-essential employee travel, other efforts to decrease discretionary spending, and reductions in our real estate footprint. Additionally, we elected to defer certain employer payroll taxes 

4
as allowable under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES” Act) signed into law on March 27, 2020. Half of these deferrals were paid in December 2021, and the remaining deferrals are due in December 2022.

Although we have implemented significant measures to mitigate further spread of the virus, our employees, customers, suppliers, and contractors may continue to experience disruptions to business activities due to potential further government-mandated or voluntary shutdowns, general economic conditions, or other negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continuously monitoring the adverse effects of the pandemic and identifying steps to mitigate those effects. As the COVID-19 pandemic is continually evolving, we are uncertain of its ultimate duration and impact. See Part I, Item 1a. Risk Factors for further details regarding the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

Human Capital

We employed approximately 13,200 associates at August 31, 2022 of which approximately 3,900 were employed in the United States and approximately 8,400 were employed in Mexico. Our remaining associates were employed in other international locations including Europe, Canada, and the Asia/Pacific region. Union recognition and collective bargaining arrangements in place or in process cover approximately 1,600 and 7,000 associates in the United States and Mexico, respectively. Arrangements related to approximately 100 associates in the United States will expire after the next fiscal year, and arrangements for approximately 7,000 associates in Mexico will expire within the next fiscal year, primarily due to annual negotiations of union contracts. We believe that we have strong relationships with both our unionized and non-unionized associates. 

Growth and Development

A key pillar to attract, develop, and retain top talent is our focus on the growth and development of our associates. In fiscal 2022, we remained focused on development through the creation of development plans for associates, training opportunities, and other activities. Our Performance Management and other processes are intended to align associate aspirations, interests, performance, and experiences with the talent needs that enable the business. Managers and associates conduct periodic check-in discussions to encourage continuous performance feedback and improvement. These discussions also act to hold leaders accountable for creating an associate development culture. In fiscal 2022, we piloted a management effectiveness series focused on coaching to performance, which we offered through in-person events and a virtual series.

We provide self-learning resources to help associates expand their lighting, controls, and building management technical knowledge through Acuity Academy and other resources.

In fiscal 2022, we enhanced our career framework through the completion of our Global Career Architecture project. The focus of this project was to enable a culture that more effectively attracts, retains, rewards, and mobilizes talent. This project will continue to underpin our initiatives in fiscal 2023, including the launch of several new development programs and tools aimed at helping both managers and associates respond to the desire to learn and grow.

Compensation and Benefits

We review our compensation and benefit plans annually to ensure that we are providing competitive, contemporary, and inclusive programs so we can attract and retain the best people and support the health and well-being of our associates and their families. Based on this review, we offer a competitive total rewards package to our associates that includes base compensation, bonuses, profit-sharing plans, stock grants, health benefits, and/or retirement benefits commensurate with an employee's position, skill set, and experience.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

We believe that diversity, equity, and inclusion are important factors in our ongoing success. Our goal is to ensure that all associates feel valued, respected, and accepted for their contributions regardless of their race, sex, religion, ethnicity, age, gender identity, disabilities, national origin, sexual orientation, or other unique characteristics. To promote diversity in the workplace, we sponsor a diversity, equity, and inclusion council that is responsible for setting our diversity strategy and initiatives, many resulting from associate feedback. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion council consists of members of management as well as key human resource process leaders and leaders from our various employee resource groups. We currently have three employee resource groups: Minorities Amplifying Growth, Inclusion, and Community (“MAGIC”); the Women’s Network; and People Respecting Identity, Diversity, and Equity (“PRIDE”). These groups are designed to embrace, celebrate, and recognize the power of diversity.

Health and Safety

We strive to ensure our associates have a safe and collaborative work environment. Our management practices promote Environmental, Health & Safety (“EHS”) excellence. To achieve this standard, we have instituted an EHS Management System based on the goals and guidelines of the International Standards of Operation for Environmental Management, International Standards for Occupational Health & Safety Management, and our own guiding principles. These guidelines include identifying and controlling hazardous exposures for the prevention of injuries, preventing pollution, and complying with all relevant legal and other requirements. We review each facility’s qualitative and quantitative results, with an emphasis on leading indicators that help avoid violations, accidents, and injuries. A variety of different metrics are averaged to determine a facility’s performance, which is used to find continuous improvement opportunities.

COVID-19 Response

We remain committed to prioritizing the health and well-being of our associates and their families in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to follow guidelines issued by the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health providers, adapting our policies and procedures quickly in response to continually evolving information, statistics, and best practices. We expanded paid and unpaid leave policies to cover exposures, quarantines, vaccination, and testing. At our manufacturing and distribution facilities, we continue to have in place safety protocols, regularly clean work areas, and encourage all associates to engage in good handwashing and hygiene practices. We also offered on-site vaccination clinics at several facilities and strongly encouraged our associates to get vaccinated.

Environmental Sustainability

We save energy and help reduce carbon emissions through our lighting, lighting controls, and building management solutions replacing older technologies, and we drive innovation and performance across our business to minimize our impact on the environment. We also seek to use raw materials more efficiently and to operate our own facilities in a more intelligent, environmentally-friendly manner. We have extended the capabilities of our energy data management software, Atrius Building Insights, to enable users to track and report their full carbon footprint. We regularly communicate progress as part of our EarthLIGHT sustainability program.
