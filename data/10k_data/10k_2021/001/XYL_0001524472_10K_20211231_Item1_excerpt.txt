Our vision is to create a world in which water issues are no longer a constraint to health, prosperity and sustainable development. 

Our Industry

Our planet faces serious water challenges. Less than 1% of the total water available on earth is fresh water, and these supplies are threatened by factors such as the draining of aquifers, increased pollution and the effects of climate change. Demand for fresh water is rising rapidly due to population growth, industrial expansion, and increased agricultural development, with consumption estimated to double every 20 years. By 2025, more than 30% of the world’s population is expected to live in areas without adequate water supply. Even in developed countries with sufficient clean water supply, existing water supply infrastructure is aging and often inefficient. In the U.S., deteriorating pipe systems, theft or inaccurate meters result in approximately one out of every six gallons of treated water being lost prior to reaching the end customer. This problem of "non-revenue" water is a major financial challenge of many utilities globally, especially in developing markets where non-revenue water can represent 10% to 60% or more of net water produced. These and other challenges create opportunities for growth in the global water industry. We estimate the total addressable market size of the global water industry, excluding operational expenditures related to labor, energy, and chemicals, to be approximately $600 billion. 

Global water needs cannot be met without streamlining the water industry’s cost structure with technologies that fundamentally change the provision and management of water. We compete in areas that are pivotal to improving "water affordability" and "resilience", while reducing the impact of "water scarcity". "Water affordability" refers to the more efficient delivery, use and treatment of clean water and wastewater. "Resilience" refers to the management of water-related risks, including climate change mitigation, and the resilience of water infrastructure. "Water scarcity" refers to the management of limited supplies of water due to climate change, overpopulation and pollution. Our customers often face all three of these challenges, ranging from inefficient and aging water distribution networks and energy-intensive or unreliable water and wastewater management systems (requiring improvements in water affordability); droughts and pollution which limit the amount of water readily available (causing water scarcity); or exposure to natural disasters such as floods or droughts (requiring improvements in resilience). Additionally, we also provide solutions to enhance communications and efficiency, improve safety and conserve resources to customers in the water and energy sectors. Delivering value in these areas creates significant opportunity for the Company.

The Global Water Industry Value Chain

The water industry value chain includes Equipment, Technology and Services companies, like Xylem, that address the unique challenges and demands of a diverse customer base. This customer base includes water and wastewater utilities that supply, treat and monitor clean water or transport, treat and analyze wastewater or storm water through an infrastructure network, and engineering, procurement and construction ("EPC") firms and third party contractors, that work with utilities to design and build water and wastewater infrastructure networks, as depicted below. Utilities and other customers require products, solutions, services, technology and application expertise from their Equipment, Technology and Services providers to address trends such as rising pollution, stricter regulations, increasing operational costs and the increased outsourcing of process knowledge. In addition to utilities, Equipment, Technology and Service companies also provide distinct technologies and application expertise to a wide array of entities, including farms, mines, power plants, industrial facilities (such as food and beverage and pharmaceutical manufacturers) and residential and commercial customers seeking to address similar trends.

Water Industry Supply Chain

We seek to continue embedding a continuous improvement mindset throughout the Company, and will continue to improve our efficiency, simplify our business and manage costs to support continued growth. We are committed to eliminating business complexity by streamlining internal bureaucracy and expanding standard business platforms and processes to help people do their jobs. This will result in freeing up time to ensure that we focus on work that creates customer value. Other focus areas include removing unnecessary costs from our end-to-end value chain to free up resources for growth; and building resilience and sustainability into our supply chain to protect our ability to serve customers.

•Cultivate Leadership and Talent Development. We continue to foster an empowering, mission-driven, diverse and inclusive culture. We will continue to build leadership succession depth and breadth in keeping with our commitment to developing the next generation of leaders. We will also align our incentives, including share-based and performance-based compensation, and organizational structure to our strategy, favoring approaches to drive 'one company' skills, mindset and behaviors, and stakeholder value creation. 

Our strategic plan firmly embeds sustainability at the heart of our competitive advantage and unique business model, and aligns each of our five core strategic pillars to the overarching goal of integrating sustainability into everything we do. 

While our strategy will evolve in response to the changing world, our four values are the enduring principles that go to the heart of who we are and guide how we conduct ourselves each day: Respect, Responsibility, Integrity and Creativity.

Business Segments, Distribution and Competitive Landscape

We have three reportable business segments that are aligned around the critical market applications they provide: Water Infrastructure, Applied Water, and Measurement & Control Solutions. See Note 22, “Segment and Geographic Data,” in our consolidated financial statements for financial information about segments and geographic areas.

The table and descriptions below provide an overview of our business segments:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Water Infrastructure

Our Water Infrastructure segment primarily supports the process that collects water from a source, treats it and distributes it to users, and then treats and returns the wastewater responsibly to the environment through two closely linked applications: Transport and Treatment. The Transport application also includes sales and rental of specialty dewatering pumps and related equipment and services, which provide the safe removal or draining of groundwater and surface water from construction sites or other industrial sites and bypass pumping for the repair of aging utility infrastructure, as well as emergency water transport and removal during severe weather events.

The customer base consists of two primary end markets: utility and industrial. The utility market includes public, private and public-private entities that support water, wastewater and storm water networks. The industrial market includes customers that require similar water and wastewater infrastructure networks to support various industrial operations.

7

Water Infrastructure sells primarily through direct channels with remaining sales through indirect channels and service capabilities. Both utility and industrial facility customers increasingly require our teams’ global but locally proficient expertise to use our equipment in their specific applications. Several trends are increasing demand for this application expertise: (i) the increase in both the type and amount of contaminants found in the water supply, (ii) increasing environmental regulations, (iii) the need to increase system efficiencies and resilience to optimize energy and other operational costs, (iv) the retirement of an aging water industry workforce that has not been systematically renewed at utilities and other end-user customers, and (v) the build-out of water infrastructure in the emerging markets. 

Given the highly fragmented nature of the water industry, the Water Infrastructure segment competes with a large number of businesses and no one business competes across all the markets Water Infrastructure serves. We differentiate ourselves in the market by focusing on product and service performance, quality and reliability, innovation, speed to market with new or disruptive technologies and business models, application expertise, brand reputation, energy efficiency, product security, product life-cycle cost, timeliness of delivery, proximity of service centers, effectiveness of our distribution channels, price and customers' experience in doing business with us. Increasingly digital solutions and analytics are important competitive differentiators. We are actively expanding our capabilities in these areas and integrating them together with our legacy technologies and service offerings as well as capabilities from other Xylem business units to present ever more compelling solutions to our customers. In the sale or rental of products and provision of services, we benefit from our large installed base, which requires maintenance, repair and replacement parts due to the critical application and nature of the products and the conditions under which they operate. Timeliness of delivery, quality and the proximity of service centers are important customer considerations when selecting a provider for after-market products and services as well as equipment rentals. In geographic regions where we are locally positioned to provide a quick response, customers have historically relied on us, rather than our competitors, for after-market products relating to our highly engineered and customized solutions. Our key competitors in the Water Infrastructure segment include KSB Inc., Sulzer Ltd., Evoqua Water Technologies, United Rentals, Trojan (Danaher Corporation) and Grundfos.

Applied Water

Applied Water encompasses the uses of water in two primary applications: Building Services and Industrial Water. These applications serve a diverse set of customers in the commercial, residential and industrial end markets. Residential consumers represent the end users in the residential market, while owners and managers of properties such as apartment buildings, retail stores, institutional buildings, restaurants, schools/universities, hospitals and hotels are examples of end users in the commercial market. The industrial market includes OEMs, exploration and production firms, and developers and managers of industrial facilities, such as electrical power generators, chemical manufacturers, machine shops, clothing manufacturers, marine, food and beverage companies and car washes.

In the Applied Water segment, end markets vary widely and, as a result, specialized distribution partners are often preferred. As such, the Applied Water segment provides the majority of its sales through strong indirect channels with the remaining sales going through our global direct sales channels. We have long-standing relationships with many of the leading independent distributors in the markets we serve and we provide incentives to distributors, such as specialized loyalty and training programs.

Population growth, urbanization regulatory requirements on energy efficiency and eco-friendly buildings are macro growth drivers of these markets, driving the need for housing, food, community services and retail goods within growing city centers. 

Competition in the Applied Water segment focuses on brand reputation, application expertise, product delivery, performance and energy efficiency, quality and reliability, and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, coupled with world-class application expertise. We believe our distribution through well-established channels and our reputation for quality significantly enhance our market position. Our ability to deliver innovative product offerings has enabled us to compete effectively, to cultivate and maintain customer relationships and to serve and expand into many niche and new markets. Our key competitors in the Applied Water segment include Grundfos, Wilo SE, Pentair plc and Franklin Electric Co., Inc.

Measurement & Control Solutions

Measurement & Control Solutions develops advanced technology solutions that enable intelligent use and conservation of critical water and energy resources. The segment delivers communications, smart metering, measurement and control technologies and critical infrastructure technologies that allow customers to more effectively use their distribution networks for the delivery, monitoring and control of critical resources such as water, electricity and natural gas. We also provide analytical instrumentation used to measure and analyze water 

8

quality, flow and level in clean water, wastewater, surface water and coastal environments. Additionally, we offer software and services including cloud-based analytics, remote monitoring and data management, leak detection, condition assessment, asset management and pressure monitoring solutions. 

At the heart of our leading technologies are automation, data management and decision support. Communications networks enable customers to automate and optimize meter reading, bill customers, monitor flow rates and detect and enable rapid response to changing and unsafe conditions. In short, they provide insight into operations and enable our customers to manage the entire scope of their operations remotely through their networks. At the center of our offering is the FlexNet communication network, which provides a common communications platform and infrastructure for essential metering services. This two-way communication technology remotely connects a wide variety of smart points in a given network with protocols, frequently on Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") licensed spectrum in the U.S., to enable reliable, resilient and secure transmissions. These technologies allow our customers to remotely and continuously monitor their water and energy distribution infrastructure, prioritize and manage maintenance, and use data to optimize many aspects of their networks. Our Advanced Infrastructure Analytics platform complements these offerings with intelligent solutions that help utility decision-makers manage and maintain their networks more effectively in real time.

The majority of our sales in the U.S. are conducted through strong, long-standing relationships with leading distributors and dedicated channel partners for the water and energy markets. Internationally, direct sales are often made in markets without established distribution channels; however, some distribution channels are used in more developed markets. A more direct sales approach, with key account management, is employed for large utilities and government programs.

Macro growth drivers include increasing regulation, aging infrastructure and worldwide movement towards smart grid implementation. Water scarcity and conservation, as well as the need to prevent revenue loss (via inaccurate meter readings, leaks or theft) are among the drivers of smart meter and leak detection technologies. 

Our Sensus-branded meters are well positioned in the smart metering sector, the fastest growing sector of the global meter industry. We set ourselves apart in the industry by focusing on our communication network, innovation, new product development and service offerings that deliver tangible savings of non-revenue water through improved meter accuracy, reduced theft and identification of leaks. Our Pure Technologies equipment and services are also well positioned in the leak detection sector, which is attracting considerable attention as aging infrastructure and increased regulatory scrutiny exert pressure on operating budgets. Our key competitors in the Measurement & Control Solutions segment include Itron, Badger Meter, Landis+Gyr, Neptune (Roper), Elster (Honeywell), Echologics (Mueller Water Products), Hach (Danaher Corporation) and Teledyne.

Geographic Profile

The table below illustrates the annual revenue and percentage of revenue by geographic area for each of the three years ended December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Emerging Markets includes results from the following regions: Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Asia Pacific (excluding Japan, Australia and New Zealand, which are presented in "Other")

Supply and Seasonality

We have a global manufacturing and assembly footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. All of our businesses require various parts and raw materials, the availability and prices of which may fluctuate. Parts and raw materials commonly used in our products include motors, fabricated parts, castings, bearings, seals, batteries, printed circuit boards ("PCBs") and electronic components, including semiconductors, as well as commodities, including steel, brass, nickel, copper, aluminum and plastics. While we may recover some cost increases through operational improvements, we are still exposed to pricing risk, including 

9

due to duty and tariff assessments by the U.S. or other governments on foreign imports. We attempt to control costs through fixed-priced contracts with suppliers and various other programs, such as our global procurement initiative.

Our business relies on third-party suppliers, contract manufacturing and commodity markets to secure raw materials, parts and components used in our products. We typically acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our materials requirements. For many of our products we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources may be readily available.

We may experience price volatility or supply constraints for materials that are not available from multiple sources. From time to time, we acquire certain inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with suppliers to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. 

Our business segments experience a modest level of seasonality in their operations. This seasonality is dependent on factors such as customers' capital spending, as well as the effects of climate change and weather conditions, including heavy flooding, prolonged droughts and fluctuations in temperatures or weather patterns, all of which can positively or negatively impact portions of our business. 

Customers

Our business is not dependent on any single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our Company. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019.

Backlog

Backlog includes orders on hand as well as contractual customer agreements at the end of the period. Delivery schedules vary from customer to customer based on their requirements. Annual or multi-year contracts are subject to rescheduling and cancellation by customers due to the long-term nature of the contracts. As such, beginning total backlog, plus orders, minus revenues, will not equal ending total backlog due to contract adjustments, foreign currency fluctuations, and other factors. Typically, large projects require longer lead production cycles and deployment schedules, and delays occur from time to time. Total backlog was $3,240 million at December 31, 2021 and $2,124 million at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that approximately 60% of the backlog at December 31, 2021 will be recognized as revenue during 2022. 

Research and Development

Research and development (“R&D”) is a key foundation of our growth strategy and we focus on the design and development of products and application know-how that address anticipated customer needs and emerging trends. Our engineers are involved in new product development as well as improvement of existing products to increase customer value. Our businesses invest substantial resources into R&D. We anticipate we will continue to develop and invest in our R&D capabilities to promote a steady flow of innovative, high-quality and reliable products and integrated solutions to further strengthen our position in the markets we serve. In addition to investments made in software development, which were capitalized, we incurred $204 million, $187 million, and $191 million as a result of R&D investment spending in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We have R&D and product development capabilities around the world. R&D activities are initially conducted in our technology centers, located in conjunction with some of our major manufacturing facilities to enable an efficient and robust development process. We have several global technical centers and local development teams around the world where we are supporting global needs and accelerating the customization of our products and solutions to address local needs. In some cases, our R&D activities are conducted at our piloting and testing facilities and at strategic customer sites. These piloting and testing facilities enable us to serve our strategic markets globally. As part of expanding our bandwidth and to increase our access to technology, we have built innovation eco-system partnerships with academic institutions, start-up accelerators and venture capital organizations.

Capitalized Software

We offer software as a product or service directly to external customers, which is included within "Other intangible assets, net" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had net capitalized software used in sales and services to external customers of $211 million and $182 million, respectively. 

10

Intellectual Property

We generally seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements that we believe will improve our competitive position and are not suitable to be kept as a trade secret. We believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and improving our return on R&D investments. While we own, control or license a significant number of patents, trade secrets, proprietary information, trademarks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business, management believes that our business, as a whole, as well as each of our core business segments, is not materially dependent on any one intellectual property right or related group of such rights.

Patents, patent applications and license agreements expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. As the portfolio of our patents, patent applications and license agreements has evolved over time, we do not expect the expiration of any specific patent to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Governmental Regulations

Environmental Regulations

Our global operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment and climate change, such as those promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and similar state and foreign environmental agencies, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances. While environmental and climate change laws and regulations are subject to change, such changes can be difficult to predict reliably and the timing of potential changes is uncertain. Management does not believe, based on current circumstances, that compliance costs pursuant to such regulations will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. However, the effect of future legislative or regulatory changes could be material to our financial condition or results of operations.

We continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources, reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our processes and remediate identified environmental concerns. We are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities. We do not anticipate these liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. At December 31, 2021, we had estimated and accrued $3 million related to environmental matters.

Other Regulations

As a company with global operations, we are subject to complex U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations in the countries where we conduct business, including with respect to trade, such as tariffs, imports and exports; anti-bribery and corruption; antitrust and competition; data security and privacy, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the China Personal Information Protection Law ('PIPL"); use of regulated radio spectrum, including that of the U.S. FCC; lobbying activity; health and safety; and the environment, among other matters. We have policies and procedures in place to promote compliance with these laws and regulations. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on Xylem’s business is included in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” under the headings Risks Related to Our Business and Operations and Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Tax.

Sustainability

At Xylem, sustainability is at the center of who we are and what we do. As a leading global water technology company, we address some of the world’s most urgent sustainability challenges - responsible stewardship of our shared water resources and resiliency of communities to climate change. Technology is playing an increasingly important role in helping the world solve water issues. We have a long history of innovation and we are focusing on the powerful capabilities of smart technology, integrated management and data analytics. 

We believe our financial performance and commitment to sustainability go hand in hand. Xylem approaches business sustainability as a way to generate economic value while also creating value for society, thus meeting the needs of both. Accordingly, in 2019, we evolved our approach to leverage sustainability in our decision-making toward long-term value creation for our shareholders, customers, employees and communities in which we operate and we announced an ambitious slate of 2025 Sustainability goals. The progress towards these goals can be found in our 2020 Sustainability Report, which is aligned to the Global Reporting Initiative and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board frameworks.

11

In setting our 2025 Sustainability goals, we also aligned them with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals ("UNSDGs"), not only to substantiate our contribution to achieving global objectives, but also to be transparent in our communication to stakeholders by providing details on our responsibility to build a sustainable future. While Xylem embraces all 17 of the UNSDGs, we have a special focus on SDG6: Clean Water and Sanitation.

Additionally, in 2021, Xylem announced our commitment to reach Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050 across our value chain, further aligning our long-term commitment to sustainability with sector-wide moves towards reduced carbon footprint.

In 2021, in partnership with Goldman Sachs, we continued our work towards further integrating our business and finance strategies with sustainability by creating a cash account tied to performance of select 2025 Sustainability goals. In 2020, Xylem completed a $1 billion Green Bond offering in senior unsecured notes, consisting of $500 million of 1.950% senior notes due in January 2028 and $500 million of 2.250% senior notes due in January 2031. The proceeds of this offering were allocated to green projects that help improve water accessibility, water affordability, and water systems resilience. This follows our 2019 execution of a five-year revolving credit facility (the “2019 Credit Facility”) with Citibank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The 2019 Credit Facility includes a pricing grid that determines the applicable margin based on Xylem's credit rating, with a further adjustment depending on Xylem's annual Sustainalytics Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) score, an important barometer of Xylem’s continued commitment to sustainability. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2021, we issued a special grant of less than 0.1 million ESG performance share units. 

Human Capital

Our colleagues around the globe are united in a shared purpose – to solve water – and, as such, are key to the Company’s success and execution of our strategy. We continue to foster an empowering, mission-driven, people-centered, diverse and inclusive culture. We believe that our overall success and long-term growth depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract and retain diverse and highly skilled colleagues, including senior leaders and colleagues with skills in our strategic competencies, such as engineering, innovation, digital technologies, sales excellence, sustainability and product and project management. The market for highly-skilled talent and leaders in our industry is increasingly competitive, but we believe our culture is a differentiator and therefore important to our ability to attract and retain employees.

As of December 31, 2021, Xylem employed approximately 17,300 employees worldwide, of which approximately 1,200 were temporary or fixed-term employees or interns. We have approximately 5,700 employees in the U.S., 8,100 in Europe, and 3,000 in Asia Pacific, with the remaining 1,000 in other geographies in which we operate. Approximately 18% of our U.S. colleagues are represented by labor unions. In certain foreign countries, our colleagues are represented by labor unions and/or work councils. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

We conduct periodic employee engagement surveys to understand our employees’ perspectives, identify areas for additional focus and establish action plans. These surveys cover a range of topics, including employee engagement, company culture, customer focus, organizational effectiveness, employee well-being, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay for performance and development opportunities. 86% of our employees globally participated in our 2021 engagement survey, and our engagement index showed increases from the 2019 survey.

Our Vision and Values

Our vision and values provide the foundation for how we want to grow as a company as well as the inspiration for how we want to behave as industry leaders and ethical corporate citizens. Our vision is to create a world in which water issues are no longer a constraint to health, prosperity, and sustainable development. We devote our technology, time and talent to advance the smarter use of water and our colleagues are guided by our core values:

•Respect for each other, for diversity of people and opinions, for the environment;

•Responsibility for our words and actions, for customer satisfaction, for giving back to our communities; 

•Integrity for acting ethically, for doing what we say we’ll do, for having the courage to communicate with candor; and

•Creativity for thinking beyond boundaries, for anticipating tomorrow’s challenges, for unlocking growth potential.

12

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We are committed to a workplace that creates a sense of belonging for everyone: where all our colleagues feel involved, respected, valued, connected and able to bring their authentic selves to work. At Xylem, we recognize the power of diversity and inclusion to drive innovation, make us more competitive, positively impact customer satisfaction and Company performance, and create value for our shareholders and other stakeholders.

Our commitment to building a global, diverse and inclusive culture starts at the top with our Board of Directors and senior leadership team members, who represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. As of February 25, 2022, 50% of our directors have origins outside the U.S., and 50% of our directors also identify as diverse from a gender, ethnic or racial standpoint. Approximately 17% of our senior leadership team members have origins outside the U.S., and approximately 42% of our senior leadership team also identify as diverse from a gender, ethnic or racial standpoint. We believe that the diversity of our Board of Directors and senior leadership enhances our ability to evolve and execute our business strategy and to attract and retain diverse and highly qualified talent, and also fuels our commitment to building a culture of inclusion, and providing our colleagues with equitable access to opportunities. As of December 31, 2021 globally, 25% of our colleagues identify as female; in the U.S., 25% of our colleagues identify as U.S. minorities.

Diversity and inclusion metrics are included in our regular business reviews to improve transparency and drive accountability by highlighting progress on goals and outlining steps to achieve them. In addition, we publicly disclose various workforce metrics regarding gender, age and racial and ethnic diversity, including our U.S. EEO-1 report.

We provide periodic training on diversity, equity and inclusion globally, including for our senior leaders. We offer Employee Network Groups, which are voluntary, employee-led groups formed by people with a common affinity, such as gender, race, sexual orientation and gender identity, military status or other attributes. Each Employee Network Group is sponsored and supported by one or more senior leaders and all groups are open to all employees regardless of any diversity attributes with which they may identify. Collectively, approximately 3,700 colleagues participate as members of our network groups. These groups are a critical part of Xylem’s diversity, equity and inclusion strategy and empower colleagues. Each group has a collective voice to speak with management, including the opportunity to voice concerns as a community and to drive change and advance inclusion and innovation. In addition, our CEO and senior leadership team hold regular global town hall meetings, as well as smaller regional or local town halls, to share and hear from our colleagues across all areas of the Company and geographies.

Health and Safety

Protecting the safety, health and well-being of our colleagues is one of our highest priorities. We have a strong Environmental, Health and Safety program that focuses on governance, risk reduction, training and education, and leadership accountability to provide our colleagues with safe and healthy workplaces. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to take additional measures to protect the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues, including a support pay program for colleagues impacted by the pandemic which remained in place throughout 2021, an essential services support pay program for colleagues whose roles were classified as an “essential service” requiring work on-site at a Xylem facility or in the field supporting customers, and the transition of office-based colleagues to remote work-from-home status where possible, which enabled us to minimize disruptions to our operations and continue to support our customers. In addition, our senior leadership team held listening sessions with colleagues who were also caregivers to understand their unique challenges and evolve our support accordingly. In order to maintain a safe work environment for our colleagues, our production facilities spread out operations over multiple shifts and implemented other protective measures, such as temperature screening and social distancing, while maintaining operational capabilities. In response to our 2021 employee engagement survey, we sought specific feedback on mental well-being and are augmenting our holistic well-being strategies as a result.

Compensation and Benefits

Attracting, motivating and retaining talented colleagues worldwide is essential to the success of our business. Accordingly, we endeavor to provide our colleagues with competitive compensation and benefits, including paid parental leave in the United States. Xylem takes a total rewards approach that integrates programs for compensation, benefits, recognition and work-life balance. While individual program components may differ by country, role or level, our culture and commitment to results and equity remain constant. 

We seek to align our human capital and sustainability strategies to support our mission-driven culture and further our shared value approach, which is designed to generate increased economic and social value for our investors and other stakeholders. Accordingly, in 2021, the Company expanded its sustainability-linked compensation for all 

13

of our senior leaders, as well as a broader group of executives, with a special, one-time grant of performance share units with goals that are based on 5 of our strategically transformative 2025 sustainability goals.

Career Development 

We are committed to enhancing colleagues’ capabilities needed to win in the marketplace and are focused on enhancing digital literacy, sales effectiveness, and other skills needed to support execution of our strategy. We also are focused on internal talent mobility across functions, geographies and businesses. Through our continuous improvement program, we nurture and grow a continuous improvement mindset throughout all areas of the Company.

We have a broad range of talent development programs and experiences to facilitate the continued professional growth and leadership development of our colleagues and to support our succession plans. These programs span across all levels, businesses and functions, including entry-level talent recruitment programs, development programs for emerging leaders, manager training and executive development. We also provide on-demand/self-paced learning through our learning management system.

We also prioritize employee engagement through regular, year-round discussions focused on employee performance feedback and development, opportunities to work on special projects, and volunteer activities involving Watermark, our corporate social responsibility program, as well as Xylem Ignite, our youth engagement program. Our Employee Network Groups foster inclusion and support the development of our colleagues by offering formal and informal leadership opportunities and creating visibility for colleagues.

Workplace Flexibility

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our colleagues discovered innovative ways to engage customers and suppliers, and collaborate with each other on complex global or cross-functional projects, adapted to stay strong and productive, and remained highly engaged and committed to our vision as a Company. This agility has also helped us see new business capabilities and ways of working together.

We have heard from many of our office-based colleagues that they greatly value the increased flexibility and autonomy that came with remote working. We believe that an appropriately tailored approach that balances in the office, fully remote and hybrid arrangements will increase our ability to retain and attract the best, most diverse talent, and reduce our carbon footprint associated with unnecessary commuting and business travel. 

We are committed to preparing and enabling both management and our colleagues for this new way of working, while we continue to foster an inclusive, equitable culture that promotes engagement, innovation, performance and trust, including for our on-site manufacturing and field services colleagues.

Labor Relations

Xylem respects the work of labor organizations, work councils and trade unions to better the lives of working people. Accordingly, Xylem respects the legal rights of its colleagues to join or to refrain from joining such organizations. An employee’s decision to join or not join a labor organization will in no way account for any discrimination against that employee. Xylem makes managers at all levels aware of the importance of respecting the rights of colleagues to organize or be represented. Our experience supports our core belief that a favorable, collaborative work environment with direct communication between employees and management serves not only the interests of employees but also the interests of Xylem as a company. We work to establish favorable employment conditions that promote positive relationships between our colleagues and their managers, facilitate communications among our colleagues and support their development.
