Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

The following discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Company’s business and reportable segments in Part I, Item 1. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” below and in Risk factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.

Certain amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements and associated notes may not add due to rounding. All percentages have been calculated using unrounded amounts for each of the periods presented.

INTRODUCTION AND SEGMENTS

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Walgreens Boots Alliance” or the “Company”) is a global leader in retail pharmacy and is positioning itself to become a leading provider of healthcare services. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments:

•U.S. Retail Pharmacy, 

•International, and

•U.S. Healthcare. 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company changed the name of two reportable segments to better align with the Company’s business activities, structure and strategy. The “United States” segment was renamed to “U.S. Retail Pharmacy” and the “Walgreens Health” segment was renamed to “U.S. Healthcare”. The segment name changes did not result in any change to the composition of the segments and therefore no change to the historical results of segment operations. The information for these segments for all periods included in these consolidated financial statements has been presented using the new names. See Note 17. Segment reporting and Note 18. Sales, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

FACTORS, TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING OUR RESULTS AND COMPARABILITY

The Company has been, and we expect it to continue to be, affected by a number of factors that may cause actual results to differ from our historical results or current expectations. These factors include: the impact of COVID-19 (“COVID-19”) on our operations and financial results; the financial performance of our equity method investees, including AmerisourceBergen; the influence of certain holidays; seasonality; foreign currency rates; changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and associated reimbursement pressure; strategic transactions and acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic collaborations; changes in laws, including U.S. tax law changes; changes in trade tariffs, including trade relations between the U.S. and China, and international relations, including the UK's withdrawal from the European Union and its impact on our operations and prospects, and those of our customers and counterparties; the timing and magnitude of cost reduction initiatives, including under our Transformational Cost Management Program (as defined below); the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; fluctuations in variable costs; the impacts of looting, natural disasters, war, terrorism and other catastrophic events, and changes in general economic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates. 

Specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the U.S., a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. To better serve the evolving specialty pharmacy market, in March 2017, the Company and Prime Therapeutics LLC, a PBM, closed a transaction to form a combined central specialty pharmacy and mail services company, AllianceRx Walgreens Prime, using an innovative model that sought to align pharmacy, PBM and health plans to coordinate patient care, improve health outcomes and deliver cost of care opportunities. On December 31, 2021, the Company purchased Prime’s portion of the joint venture and now wholly own the joint venture, which was renamed AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients of AllianceRx Walgreens are not obligated to contract through AllianceRx Walgreens, and have in the past, and may in the future, enter into specialty pharmacy and other agreements without involving AllianceRx Walgreens. Certain clients have chosen not to renew their contracts through AllianceRx Walgreens which impacts gross sales. However, considering the relatively low margin nature of this business, the Company does not anticipate this will have a material impact on operating income.

In January 2022, the Company announced a strategic review of its Boots business, including the No7 beauty company. In June 2022, the Company announced the conclusion of the strategic review and decision to retain existing ownership in these businesses.

On May 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida. The settlement amount of $683 million includes $620 million to be paid in equal installments to the State of Florida over 18 years and will be applied as remediation of past and future opioid damages, as well as a one-time payment of $63 million for attorneys’ fees. The Company made the first annual settlement payment of $97.4 million into escrow on June 17, 2022.

These and other factors can affect the Company’s operations and net earnings for any period and may cause such results not to be comparable to the same period in previous years. The results presented in this report are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

COVID-19

Since the beginning of 2020, COVID-19 has severely impacted, and may continue to directly and indirectly impact, the economies of the U.S., the UK and other countries around the world. COVID-19 created significant public health concerns as well as significant volatility, uncertainty and economic and supply chain disruption in every region in which we operate, which has adversely affected our industries and our business operations. Further, financial and credit markets experienced volatility and could continue to experience volatility due to COVID-19 and other factors. As COVID-19 and its direct and indirect consequences continue to evolve, COVID-19 has impacted, and may again impact our business operations. In response to COVID-19 and emerging variants, various domestic and foreign, federal, state and local governmental legislation, regulations, orders, policies and initiatives were implemented that were designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19, as well as to help address economic and market volatility and instability resulting from COVID-19. The Company has participated in certain of these programs, including for example availing itself to certain tax deferrals which were introduced by the CARES Act in the U.S., and certain tax deferral and benefit and employee wage support in the UK, and if available, may continue to do so in the future.

The Company continues to play a critical role in fighting COVID-19. The Company has worked with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the U.S. government to help administer COVID-19 vaccinations to the general public and to high priority groups, including long-term care facility residents and staff. The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment also expanded vaccination models to ensure convenient access, including same-day and walk-in appointments, mobile clinics, employer partnerships and extended hours. As of August 31, 2022, the Company has administered more than 69 million COVID-19 vaccinations, including 23 million booster vaccinations, and more than 45 million COVID-19 tests in the U.S. In fiscal 2022, the Company has administered approximately 35 million COVID-19 vaccinations and more than 31 million COVID-19 tests in the U.S.

In fiscal 2022, the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions filled increased 1.3%, including a positive impact of 12 basis points from COVID-19 vaccinations. Comparable retail sales increase was aided by at-home COVID-19 test sales.

The Company continues to monitor COVID-19 and its potential future impacts on the consumer, customer and healthcare utilization patterns, as well as the U.S. and global economies, including supply chains and the labor force. As a result, the financial and/or operational impact on the Company, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact, singularly or collectively, could be material and adverse.

The Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed below under “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements” and in Item 1A, Risk factors.

U.S. Healthcare

In fiscal 2022, the Company announced the launch of its new healthcare strategy. The Company plans to become a leading provider of local clinical care services by leveraging its consumer-centric technology and retail pharmacy network to deliver value-based care. The Company’s goal is to provide better consumer experiences, improve health outcomes and lower costs. 

The Company’s U.S. Healthcare segment, created at the beginning of fiscal 2022, is a consumer-centric, technology-enabled healthcare business that engages consumers through a personalized, omni-channel experience across the care journey. The U.S. Healthcare segment delivers improved health outcomes and lower costs for payors and providers by delivering care through owned and partnered assets.

The U.S. Healthcare segment currently consists of a majority position in Village Practice Management Company, LLC (“VillageMD”), a leading, national provider of value-based primary care services; a majority position in Shields Health Solutions Parent, LLC (“Shields”), a specialty pharmacy integrator and accelerator for hospitals, a majority position in CCX Next, LLC (“CareCentrix”), a leading player in the post-acute and home care management sectors; and the Walgreens Health organic business that contracts with payors and providers to deliver clinical healthcare services to their members and members’ caregivers through both digital and physical channels. On September 20, 2022, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 30% equity interest in Shields, not currently owned.

The Company is now aligned into three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pharmacy, International and U.S. Healthcare.

TRANSFORMATIONAL COST MANAGEMENT PROGRAM

On December 20, 2018, the Company announced a transformational cost management program that was expected to deliver in excess of $2.0 billion of annual cost savings by fiscal 2022 (the “Transformational Cost Management Program”). The Company achieved this goal at the end of fiscal 2021.

On October 12, 2021, the Company expanded and extended the Transformational Cost Management Program through the end of fiscal 2024 and increased its annual cost savings target to $3.3 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. In fiscal 2022, the Company increased its annual cost savings target from $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2024. The Company is currently on track to achieve the savings target.

The Transformational Cost Management Program, which is multi-faceted and includes divisional optimization initiatives, global smart spending, global smart organization and the transformation of the Company’s information technology (IT) capabilities, is designed to help the Company achieve increased cost efficiencies. To date, the Company has taken actions across all aspects of the Transformational Cost Management Program which focus on the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and International reportable segments along with the Company's global functions. Divisional optimization within the Company’s segments includes activities such as optimization of stores, including plans to close approximately 350 stores in the UK and approximately 450 to 500 stores in the U.S. As of August 31, 2022, the Company has closed 235 and 287 stores in the UK and U.S., respectively.

The Company currently estimates that the Transformational Cost Management Program will result in cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of approximately $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, of which $3.3 billion to $3.6 billion are expected to be recorded as exit and disposal activities. In addition to the impacts discussed above, as a result of the actions related to store closures taken under the Transformational Cost Management Program, the Company recorded $508 million of transition adjustments to decrease retained earnings due to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard (Topic 842) that became effective on September 1, 2019. The Company estimates that approximately 80% of the cumulative pre-tax charges relating to the Transformational Cost Management Program represent current or future cash expenditures, primarily related to employee severance and business transition costs, IT transformation and lease and other real estate payments. 

The Company currently estimates that it will recognize aggregate pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as follows:

1Includes impairments relating to operating lease right-of-use and finance lease assets.

2Primarily related to store closures and other asset impairments.

From the inception of the Transformational Cost Management Program to August 31, 2022, the Company has recognized cumulative pre-tax charges to its financial results in accordance with GAAP of $2.2 billion, of which $2.0 billion is recorded as exit and disposal activities. See Note 4. Exit and disposal activities, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. These charges included $603 million related to lease obligations and other real estate costs, $443 million in asset impairments, $723 million in employee severance and business transition costs, $203 million of information technology transformation and other exit costs, and $272 million in other information technology costs.

Transformational Cost Management Program charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP. The Company treats charges related to the Transformational Cost Management Program as special items impacting comparability of results in its earnings disclosures. 

The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See “Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements”.

INVESTMENT IN AMERISOURCEBERGEN

As of August 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the Company owns approximately 25.4% and 28.5% of AmerisourceBergen outstanding common stock, based on the share count publicly reported by AmerisourceBergen in its most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

On May 11, 2022, the Company sold 6.0 million shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock pursuant to Rule 144 at a price of $150 per share for a total consideration of $900 million, decreasing the Company's ownership of AmerisourceBergen’s common stock from 58,854,867 shares, held at August 31, 2021 to 52,854,867 shares held as of August 31, 2022. The transaction resulted in the Company recording a pre-tax gain of $417 million in Other income, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, including a $32 million loss reclassified from within Accumulated other comprehensive income in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

The Company has a shareholders agreement with AmerisourceBergen, which was most recently amended and restated (the “A&R Shareholders Agreement”) in connection with the Company's sale of its Alliance Healthcare business to AmerisourceBergen (the “Alliance Healthcare Sale”). Pursuant to the A&R Shareholders Agreement, the Company has designated one member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The Company is also permitted, subject to certain conditions, to acquire up to an additional 12,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market, and thereafter to designate another member of AmerisourceBergen’s board of directors. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.

The Company accounts for its investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings (loss) attributable to the investment classified within the Operating income of the Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment.

In fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized equity earnings (losses) in AmerisourceBergen of $418 million, $(1.1) billion, and $341 million, respectively. The equity losses for fiscal 2021 were primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of a loss of $5.6 billion, net of tax, related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months ended September 30, 2020.

The Company completed the Alliance Healthcare Sale in June 2021 per the Share Purchase Agreement with AmerisourceBergen. See Note 2. Discontinued operations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further information.

The financial performance of AmerisourceBergen will impact the Company’s results of operations. Additionally, a substantial and sustained decline in the price of AmerisourceBergen’s common stock could trigger an impairment evaluation of our investment. These considerations may materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. For more information, see Part I. Item 1. Business “Relationship with AmerisourceBergen” and Note 6. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following information summarizes our results of operations for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. For discussion related to the results of operations by segment for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our fiscal 2021 Form 10-K, as amended by Form 10-K/A which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on November 24, 2021.

Net earnings from continuing operations fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021

Fiscal 2022 net earnings attributable to the Company were $4.3 billion compared to $2.0 billion for the prior year period. Diluted net earnings per share were $5.01 compared to $2.30 for the prior year period. The increases in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share reflect a $2.5 billion after-tax gain during the three months ended November 30, 2021 due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held minority equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields to fair value, and a $1.2 billion charge, net of tax, from the Company's equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen in the prior fiscal year offset by the fiscal 2022 impairment charges related to intangible assets in Boots UK, and the charge related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in fiscal 2022. 

Other income, net in fiscal 2022 was $3.0 billion compared to $558 million in fiscal 2021. The increase in other income is mainly due to the remeasurement of the Company's previously held equity and debt investments in VillageMD and Shields to fair value, and the partial sale of the Company’s equity method investments in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care Health.

Net interest expense was $400 million and $905 million in fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in interest expense was primarily the result of early debt extinguishments completed during fiscal 2021 and lower interest rates on remaining debt.

The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 and 2021 was a 0.8% benefit and 33.4%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to pre-tax gains from the consolidation of the Company’s investments in VillageMD and Shields, for which a majority of these gains were not subject to tax. Additionally, the Company recognized tax benefit due to the reduction of a valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards. The reduction is primarily due to capital loss carryforwards utilized in the current year against capital gains recognized on the sale of shares in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care, capital gains recognized from internal restructuring, and based on forecasted capital gains. See Note 3. Acquisitions and other investments and Note 6. Equity method investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statement included in Part II, Item 8 for further information. 

Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

Adjusted net earnings attributable to the Company in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $4.4 billion compared with the prior year period. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in fiscal 2022 increased 2.5 percent to $5.04 compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted earnings per share were both negatively impacted by 0.9 percentage points as a result of currency translation.

Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted net earnings for fiscal 2022 primarily reflects improved retail contributions in the U.S. Retail Pharmacy and a continued rebound in International segment sales and profitability, partly offset by a decrease in U.S. pharmacy operating results, and growth investments in U.S. Healthcare. See “--Non-GAAP Measures” below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP and related disclosures.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT

The following information summarizes our results of operations by segment for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.

U.S. Retail Pharmacy

The Company's U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment includes the Walgreens business which is comprised of the operations of retail drugstores, health and wellness services, specialty and home delivery pharmacy services, and its equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen.

4Comparable sales are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions and comparable number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions refer to total sales, pharmacy sales, retail sales, number of prescriptions and number of 30-day equivalent prescriptions, respectively. Comparable retail sales for previous periods have been restated to include e-commerce sales. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

NM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.

Sales fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment’s sales for fiscal 2022 decreased by 2.6 percent to $109.1 billion, including a 650 basis point impact of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline. Comparable sales increased by 5.1 percent in fiscal 2022.

Pharmacy sales decreased by 5.3 percent in fiscal 2022, including 8.6 percentage point of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline and represented 73.7 percent of the segment’s sales. Excluding AllianceRx Walgreens, pharmacy sales increased 4.2 percent in fiscal 2022. The increase is due to brand drug inflation and COVID-19 vaccinations and testing, partially offset by generic drug utilization and reimbursement pressure. In fiscal 2021, pharmacy sales increased 5.5 percent and represented 75.8 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 4.7 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 6.7 percent in fiscal 2021. Within comparable sales, prescriptions filled in fiscal 2022 increased by 1.3 percent from a year earlier, including a positive impact of approximately 12 basis points from COVID-19 vaccinations. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 0.3 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to a reduction of 0.5 percent in fiscal 2021. The effect of generics on segment sales was a reduction of 0.2 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to a reduction of 0.4 percent for fiscal 2021. Third-party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.2 percent of prescription sales for fiscal 2022 compared to 97.5 percent for fiscal 2021. The total number of prescriptions (including vaccinations) filled in fiscal 2022 was 819.6 million compared to 827.5 million in fiscal 2021. Prescriptions (including vaccinations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 1,216.4 million in fiscal 2022 compared to 1,210.6 million in fiscal 2021.

Retail sales increased by 5.6 percent in fiscal 2022 and were 26.3 percent of the segment’s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2021 retail sales decreased by 0.4 percent and comprised 24.2 percent of the segment’s sales. Comparable retail sales increased 6.1 percent in fiscal 2022 and increased 1.2 percent in fiscal 2021. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by health and wellness, including favorable impact of at-home COVID-19 tests and cough, cold and flu, as well as personal care and beauty, partially offset by the planned decline in tobacco.

Operating income fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

The U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment’s operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 13.8 percent to $2.9 billion, including income of $418 million from the Company's share of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen. Excluding the impact of equity earnings in AmerisourceBergen, the year over year decrease in operating income was driven by higher Selling, general and administrative expenses, including charges related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida in the third quarter, offset by COVID-19 testing and retail gross profit growth.

Gross margin was 21.7 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to 21.2 percent in fiscal 2021. Gross margin was positively impacted in fiscal 2022 by retail margin, offset by pharmacy margin. The increase in retail margin was primarily due to favorable rate and product mix. The decrease in pharmacy margin was primarily driven by continued reimbursement pressure.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 19.4 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to 17.9 percent in fiscal 2021. The increase was driven by costs related to the opioid settlement with the State of Florida, COVID-19 vaccinations and testing and labor investments, partially offset by savings related to the Company's Transformational Cost Management Program.

The Company's International segment consists of pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses outside the U.S. and the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution business in Germany. Pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses include Boots branded stores in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Thailand, the Benavides brand in Mexico and the Ahumada brand in Chile. Sales for these businesses are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and health and wellness, beauty, personal care and other consumer products.

The International segment operates in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the British pound sterling, Euro, Chilean peso and Mexican peso and therefore the segment’s results are impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates. See Item 7A. Quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk, for further information on currency risk.

The Company presents certain information related to operating results in “constant currency,” which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency exclude the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. See “--Non-GAAP Measures.”

2Comparable sales in constant currency are defined as sales from stores that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days, including due to looting or store damage, and without a major remodel or being subject to a natural disaster, in the past twelve months as well as e-commerce sales. Comparable sales in constant currency exclude wholesale sales in Germany. E-commerce sales include digitally initiated sales online or through mobile applications. Relocated stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after the relocation. Acquired stores are not included as comparable sales for the first twelve months after acquisition or conversion, when applicable, whichever is later. Comparable sales in constant currency, comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency and comparable retail sales in constant currency refer to total sales, pharmacy sales and retail sales, respectively. The method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency varies across the retail industry and our method of calculating comparable sales in constant currency may not be the same as other retailers’ methods.

NM - Not meaningful. Percentage increases above 200% or when one period includes income and other period includes loss are considered not meaningful.

Sales fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021

The International segment’s sales for fiscal 2022 increased 6.5 percent to $21.8 billion. The adverse impact of currency translation on sales was 6.9 percentage points. Comparable sales in constant currency, which excludes sales from the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale combined business in Germany, increased 11.3 percent, reflecting growth across all markets. Sales in the comparable year ago-period included the adverse impact of strict COVID-19 restrictions on the UK store footfall.

Pharmacy sales decreased 2.1 percent in fiscal 2022 and represented 17.1 percent of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmacy sales was 4.0 percentage points. Comparable pharmacy sales in constant currency increased 2.5 percent, primarily in the UK, reflecting stronger demand for pharmacy services, and pharmacy volumes in Mexico and Chile. 

Retail sales increased 11.2 percent for fiscal 2022 and represented 31.7 percent of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on retail sales was 5.2 percentage points. Comparable retail sales in constant currency increased 16.9 percent reflecting higher retail sales in the UK and Ireland, including a recovery in store footfall compared to a year ago-period, as COVID-19 restrictions were less severe.

Pharmaceutical wholesale sales increased 6.7 percent for fiscal 2022 and represented 51.2 percent of the segment’s sales. The negative impact of currency translation on pharmaceutical wholesale sales was 8.9 percentage points. The increase in pharmaceutical wholesale sales reflects the full year of operations since the the formation of the combined business in Germany in fiscal 2021

Operating income fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

The International segment’s operating loss for fiscal 2022 was $346 million, compared to an operating income of $227 million in fiscal 2021. Operating loss was favorably impacted by 33.0 percentage points ($75 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the decrease in operating income is primarily due to non-cash impairment charges, related to intangible assets in Boots UK in the fourth quarter. 

Gross profit increased 6.7 percent in fiscal 2022. Gross profit was adversely impacted by 5.5 percentage points ($237 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase was primarily due to higher retail sales, stronger demand for pharmacy services in the UK, and incremental gross profit associated with the Company's pharmaceutical wholesale business in Germany. This was partially offset by higher NHS reimbursement levels in the year ago period.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21.0 percent in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Expenses were favorably impacted by 7.6 percentage points ($312 million) as a result of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase reflects Boots UK intangible asset impairment charges in the fourth quarter, incremental expenses associated with the Company's wholesale business in Germany, increased labor costs, and the non-recurring COVID-19 related government support in the year ago period. This was partially offset by a gain in UK from a sale-leaseback transaction.

As a percentage of sales, Selling, general and administrative expenses were 22.7 percent in fiscal 2022, compared to 20.0 percent in the prior fiscal year.

Adjusted operating income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

The International segment’s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2022 increased $260 million to $726 million. Adjusted operating income was negatively impacted by 9.8 percentage points ($46 million) of currency translation. Excluding the impact of currency translation, the increase in adjusted operating income was primarily in the UK, reflecting higher retail sales following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions, and stronger demand for pharmacy services. This was partially offset by increased Selling, general and administrative expenses and higher NHS pharmacy reimbursement levels in the year ago period in the UK.

2The Company acquired VillageMD in the three months ended November 30, 2021. The number of VillageMD clinics presented for the prior periods is for comparative purposes only. Clinics are defined as the primary care locations where the Company or the Company’s affiliates lease or license space and the providers are employed by either the Company or one of the Company’s affiliates. These clinics are primarily branded as Village Medical where the Company employs the providers but, in some instances, may operate under their own brands. 

Sales fiscal 2022

The U.S. Healthcare segment's sales for fiscal 2022 were $1.8 billion. This includes VillageMD sales of $1.5 billion and Shields sales of $286 million.

Operating loss fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021

WBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K47

Table of Contents 

Gross loss for fiscal 2022 was $22 million, reflecting results from Shields and VillageMD. Gross loss was driven by expansion at VillageMD, partly offset by further growth in existing partnerships and expanding margins at Shields.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $806 million in fiscal 2022 compared to $57 million in fiscal 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses reflect the three acquisitions as well as continued investments in the Walgreens Health organic business.

Adjusted operating loss (Non-GAAP measure) for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021

The U.S. Healthcare segment's adjusted operating loss was $370 million for fiscal 2022, reflecting the three acquisitions as well as continued investments in the Walgreens Health organic business compared to a loss of $57 million in fiscal 2021.

NON-GAAP MEASURES

The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under SEC rules, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The Company has provided the non-GAAP financial measures herein, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management has evaluated the Company’s financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believes that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company’s business from period to period and trends in the Company’s historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. 

The Company does not provide a reconciliation for non-GAAP estimates on a forward-looking basis where it is unable to provide a meaningful or accurate calculation or estimation of reconciling items and the information is not available without unreasonable effort. This is due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of various items that have not yet occurred, are out of the Company’s control or cannot be reasonably predicted, and that would impact the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measure. For the same reasons, the Company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information. Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures may vary materially from the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

1Adjustments to equity earnings (loss) in AmerisourceBergen consist of the Company’s proportionate share of non-GAAP adjustments reported by AmerisourceBergen consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP measures. The Company recognized equity losses in AmerisourceBergen of $1,373 million during the three months ended November 30, 2020. These equity losses are primarily due to AmerisourceBergen's recognition of $5.6 billion, net of tax, charges related to its ongoing opioid litigation in its financial statements for the three months period ended September 30, 2020.

2Acquisition-related amortization includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, inventory valuation adjustments and stock-based compensation fair valuation adjustments. Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets includes amortization of intangible assets such as customer relationships, trade names, trademarks, developed technology and contract intangibles. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP measures. Amortization expense, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired, or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. Business combination accounting principles require us to measure acquired inventory at fair value. The fair value of the inventory reflects cost of acquired inventory and a portion of the expected profit margin. The acquisition-related inventory valuation adjustments exclude the expected profit margin component from cost of sales recorded under the business combination accounting principles. The stock based compensation fair valuation adjustment reflects the difference between the fair value based remeasurement of awards under purchase accounting and the grant date fair valuation. Post-acquisition compensation expense recognized in excess of the original grant date fair value of acquiree awards are excluded from the related non-GAAP measures as these arise from acquisition-related accounting requirements or agreements, and are not reflective of normal operating activities.

3Transformational Cost Management Program and Store Optimization Program charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs do not reflect current operating performance and are impacted by the timing of restructuring activity.

WBA Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K51

Table of Contents 

4Certain legal and regulatory accruals and settlements relate to significant charges associated with certain legal proceedings, including legal defense costs. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a $683 million charge related to a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses.

5Acquisition-related costs are transaction and integration costs associated with certain merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities. These costs include charges incurred related to certain mergers, acquisition and divestitures related activities recorded in operating income, for example, costs related to integration efforts for merger, acquisition and divestitures activities. Examples of such costs include deal costs, severance and stock compensation. These charges are primarily recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses. These costs are significantly impacted by the timing and complexity of the underlying merger, acquisition and divestitures related activities and do not reflect the Company’s current operating performance.

6Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis and exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses.

7The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. This adjustment represents the impact on cost of sales as if the U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using first-in first-out (“FIFO”) method. The LIFO provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Therefore, the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items.

8Store damage and inventory losses as a result of looting in the U.S., net of insurance recoveries.

9Gain or loss on certain derivative instruments used as economic hedges of the Company’s net investments in foreign subsidiaries. These charges are recorded within Other income, net. We do not believe this volatility related to mark-to-market adjustment on the underlying derivative instruments reflects the Company’s operational performance.

10Impairment of equity method investment and investment in equity securities includes impairment of certain investments. The Company excludes these charges when evaluating operating performance because these do not relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business and it does not incur such charges on a predictable basis. Exclusion of such charges enables more consistent evaluation of the Company’s operating performance. These charges are recorded within Other income, net.

11In fiscal 2022, the Company finalized the working capital adjustments with AmerisourceBergen related to the sale of the Alliance Healthcare business, resulting in a $38 million charge recorded to Other income, net in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a net gain of $322 million within results of discontinued operations related to the sale of the Alliance Healthcare business. This gain was excluded as it is not reflective of normal operating activities.

12Includes significant gains on the sale of equity method investments. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded a gain of $417 million and $145 million in Other income, net due to a partial sale of its equity method investments in AmerisourceBergen and Option Care Health, respectively. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $290 million in Other income, net due to a partial sale of ownership interest in Option Care Health by the Company's then equity method investee HC Group Holdings.

13Includes significant gains on business combinations due to the remeasurement of previously held minority equity interests and debt securities to fair value. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded such pre-tax gains of $2.2 billion and $402 million for VillageMD and Shields, respectively.

14In fiscal 2022, the Company incurred a $4 million loss in connection with the early extinguishment of debt related to the integration of Shields. In fiscal 2021, the Company incurred a $419 million loss related to the Company's cash tender offers to partially purchase and retire $3.3 billion of long-term U.S. denominated notes. The Company excludes these charges as related activities do not reflect the Company’s ongoing financial performance.

15Adjustments to income tax provision (benefit) include adjustments to the GAAP basis tax provision (benefit) commensurate with non-GAAP adjustments and certain discrete tax items including U.S. and U.K. tax law changes and equity method non-cash tax. These charges are recorded within income tax provision (benefit).

16Adjustments to post tax earnings from other equity method investments consist of the proportionate share of certain equity method investees’ non-cash items or unusual or infrequent items consistent with the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments. These charges are recorded within post tax earnings from other equity method investments. Although the Company may have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with its ownership interests in these equity method investees, adjustments relating to equity method investments are not intended to imply that the Company has direct control over their operations and resulting revenue and expenses. Moreover, these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all revenue and expenses of these equity method investees. In fiscal 2021, due to partial sales of ownership interests in Option Care Health, our then equity method investee HC Group Holdings lost the ability to control Option Care Health and, therefore, deconsolidated Option Care Health in its financial statements. As a result of this deconsolidation, HC Group Holdings recognized a gain of $1.2 billion and the Company recorded its share of equity earnings in HC Group Holdings of $576 million.

The Company considers certain metrics presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, such as comparable sales, comparable pharmacy sales, comparable retail sales, comparable number of prescriptions, and comparable 30-day equivalent prescriptions, number of payor/ provider partnerships, number of locations of Walgreens Health Corners, number of co-located VillageMD clinics and number of total VillageMD clinics, at period end, to be key performance indicators because the Company’s management has evaluated its results of operations using these metrics and believes that these key performance indicators presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of the Company from period to period and trends in its historical operating results. These key performance indicators should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented herein. These measures, which are described in more detail in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may not be comparable to similarly-titled performance indicators used by other companies.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company's long-term capital policy is to: maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility; reinvest in its core strategies; invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce its core strategies and meet return requirements; and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term. In June 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors reviewed and refined the Company’s dividend policy to set forth the Company’s current intention to increase its dividend each year.

The Company’s cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that the Company may complete may also impact its cash requirements. Additionally, the Company's cash requirements, and its ability to generate cash flow, have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and the resulting market volatility and instability. For further information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on the Company, including on its liquidity and capital resources, please see Part I, Item 1A, Risk factors.

The Company expects to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, continuing obligations for recently announced or completed acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations from liquidity sources including cash flow from operations, availability under existing credit facilities, commercial paper programs, working capital financing arrangements, debt offerings, sale of marketable securities and current cash and investment balances. On June 17, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year $3.5 billion revolving credit agreement and an eighteen-month $1.5 billion revolving credit agreement. Simultaneously, with the entry into the credit agreements, the Company has terminated the Revolving Credit Agreements dated December 23, 2020 and August 29, 2018. As of August 31, 2022, the Company had an aggregate borrowing capacity under committed revolving credit facilities of $5.0 billion, with no funds drawn under these facilities. On June 3, 2022, a notice of redemption was given to holders of certain notes issued by the Company on September 13, 2012. As a result, on July 5, 2022, the notes with aggregate principal amount of $731 million were redeemed in full. The Company believes that these sources, and the ability to obtain other financing will provide adequate cash funds for the Company's foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures, pending acquisitions, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. See Part II, Item 7A, Qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk, for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and restricted cash were $2.6 billion (including $188 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2022, compared to $1.3 billion (including $204 million in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2021. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds.

On May 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement with the State of Florida to resolve all claims related to the distribution and dispensing of prescription opioid medications across the Company’s pharmacies in the State of Florida. The settlement amount of $683 million million includes $620 million to be paid in equal installments to the State of Florida over 18 years, and will be applied as remediation of past and future opioid damages, as well as a one-time payment of $63 million for attorneys’ fees. The Company made the first annual settlement payment of $97.4 million into escrow on June 17, 2022.

On August 5, 2022, the Company entered into an agreement for the sale of its equity method investment in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Company Limited for approximately $150 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

On September 20, 2022, the Company announced the acceleration of its plans for full ownership of Shields. The Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 30% equity interest for approximately $1.37 billion of cash consideration. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On October 11, 2022, the Company announced the acceleration of its plans for full ownership of CareCentrix. The Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining 45% equity interest for approximately $392 million of cash consideration. The acquisition is subject to limited customary closing conditions and is expected to close by March 2023. See Note 21. Subsequent events to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 herein for further information.

At August 31, 2022, the Company had no guarantees outstanding and the letters of credit issued were not material.

Cash flows from operating activities

Cash provided by operations and the incurrence of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.9 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $5.6 billion in fiscal 2021 and $5.5 billion in fiscal 2020. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, reflects lower cash inflows from inventories, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by higher cash inflows from accounts receivable. 

Changes in inventory, accrued expenses and other liabilities are mainly driven by timing, absence of COVID-19 related government support, and payments for certain legal and regulatory settlements. Changes in accounts payable are mainly driven by impact of AllianceRx Walgreens sales decline and timing of payments. Changes in accounts receivable are mainly driven by lower COVID-19 volume and timing of collections.

Cash flows from investing activities

Net cash (used for) provided by investing activities was $(1.1) billion, $4.1 billion and $(1.3) billion in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020.

Stock repurchase program

In June 2018, the Company's Board of Director's approved a stock repurchase program (the “June 2018 stock repurchase program”), which authorized the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock of which the Company had repurchased $8.0 billion as of August 31, 2022. The June 2018 stock repurchase program has no specified expiration date. In July 2020, the Company suspended repurchases under this program. The Company may continue to repurchase stock to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans. 

The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases, including repurchases to offset anticipated dilution from equity incentive plans, based on its assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable the Company to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under federal securities laws.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management’s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and corresponding Consolidated Balance Sheets accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, leases, goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment, long-lived assets impairment, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and post-retirement benefits, legal contingencies and income taxes. The Company uses the following methods to determine its estimates:

Business combinations – The Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to non-controlling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, the Company generally uses the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates, royalty rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset’s useful life.

Leases - The Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. The lease classification is determined at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease during the lease term. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments during the lease term. Lease commencement is the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company's estimated rate of interest for a collateralized borrowing over a similar term as the lease term. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement, lease incentives and are recorded net of impairment. Operating leases are expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term. 

The lease term of real estate leases includes renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. Options to extend are considered reasonably certain of being exercised based on evaluation if there are significant investments within the leased property which have useful lives greater than the non-cancelable lease term, performance of the underlying store and the Company’s economic and strategic initiatives. Short-term leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets.

The Company accounts for lease components and non-lease components as a single lease component. Variable lease payment amounts that cannot be determined at the commencement of the lease such as increases in lease payments based on changes in index rates or usage, are not included in the right-of-use assets or lease liabilities. These are expensed as incurred. The Company has real estate leases which require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs and hence are not included in the lease payments used to calculate lease liability. Other real estate leases contain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. The Company does not separately account for the land portion of the leases involving land and building. 

Finance leases are recognized within property, plant and equipment and as a finance lease liability within accrued expenses and other liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment – Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that could more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or intangible asset below its carrying value. As part of the Company’s impairment analysis, fair value of a reporting unit is generally determined using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping, as well as recent guideline transactions.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets fair values are estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. The determination of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangibles requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: forecasts of revenue, the selection of appropriate royalty rate and discount rates.

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the business and financial performance of the Company’s reporting units. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures.

Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions, could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, the amount of any goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges, or both. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, the impact of COVID-19, its severity, duration and its impact on global economies, general economic conditions as well as our profitability. 

The Company also compares the sum of estimated fair values of reporting units to the Company’s fair value as implied by the market value of its equity securities. This comparison provides an indication that, in total, assumptions and estimates are reasonable. Future declines in the overall market value of the Company’s equity securities may provide an indication that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

Impairment of long lived assets – The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The evaluation of long-lived assets is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at the store level for retail pharmacy operations. Long-lived assets related to the Company’s retail pharmacy operations include property, plant and equipment, definite-lived intangibles, right of use asset as well as operating lease liability. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, then an impairment charge is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the asset group compared to its carrying value. Fair value of the asset group is generally determined using the income approach based on cash flows expected from the use and eventual disposal of the asset group.

The determination of the fair value of the asset group requires management to estimate a number of factors including anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates.

Cost of sales and inventory – 

Retail, Pharmacy and Wholesale

Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and cost of services rendered, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts, vendor allowances and supplier rebates. Cost of sales is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts. 

The Company values inventories on a lower of cost and net realizable value or market basis. Inventories include product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs for retail pharmacy operations, distribution of products, and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.The Company’s U.S. Retail Pharmacy segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method. The Company’s International segment inventory is accounted for using average cost and the first-in-first-out (“FIFO”) method.

Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors’ products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Allowances received for promoting vendors’ products, if received for a specific, incremental, identifiable cost, are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of Selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs. Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier’s products purchased by the Company.

Healthcare services

For operations and activities related to the provision of healthcare, cost of services includes activities that are directly related to the provision of care, including medical claims expense, cost of care, clinic operating and support costs, and allocated depreciation and amortization. Medical claims expense represents medical claims expenses related to fee-for-service and value-based arrangements and primarily includes costs for third-party healthcare service providers that provide medical care to patients. Cost of care represents the cost of our employed providers and certain affiliated providers, including base compensation, quality incentive bonuses and provider benefits. Clinic operating and support costs include costs incurred to operate our clinics, including clinical care support staff, patient support staff, population health management employees, rent, utilities and supplies.

Equity method investments – The Company uses the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these investees is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company’s ownership interest, legal form of the investee (e.g. limited liability partnership), representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intra-entity transactions. 

The Company evaluates equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment might not be recoverable. Factors considered by the Company when reviewing an equity method investment for impairment include the length of time (duration) and the extent (severity) to which the fair value of the equity method investment has been less than cost, the investee’s financial condition and near-term prospects, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery. An impairment that is other-than-temporary is recognized in the period identified. 

Pension and post-retirement benefits – The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its non-U.S. employees. The Company also has a post-retirement healthcare plan that covers qualifying U.S. employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending on participants’ status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. 

In determining long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, the Company considers both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on its pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $213 million to the Company’s pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase the Company’s pension expense by $16 million.

The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. The post-retirement healthcare plan is not funded.

Contingencies – The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company may be unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company’s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements in a future fiscal period. Management’s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management’s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.

Income taxes –The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company’s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. The liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other non-current liabilities and current income taxes on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings. 

In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects its assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the U.S. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.
