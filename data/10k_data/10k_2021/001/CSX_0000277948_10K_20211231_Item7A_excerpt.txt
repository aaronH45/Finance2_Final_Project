Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Changes in interest rates may impact the cost of future long-term debt issued by the Company, and as a result, represent interest rate risk to the Company. In an effort to manage this risk, CSX may use certain financial instruments such as interest rate forward contracts. The following information, together with information included in Note 10, Debt and Credit Agreements, describes the key aspects of such contracts and the related market risk to CSX.

Changes in interest rates could impact the fair value of the Company's forward starting interest rate swap. On both April 29, 2020, and July 9, 2020, the Company executed a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional value of $250 million for an aggregate notional value of $500 million. These swaps were effected to hedge the benchmark interest rate associated with future interest payments related to the anticipated refinancing of notes due in 2027. The Company recognized an unrealized gain of $8 million and $62 million net of tax during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income with the related asset on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. Upon settlement of the swaps, which expire in 2027, the unrealized gain or loss in AOCI will be recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not be material. 

As of December 31, 2021, CSX has no floating rate debt obligations outstanding. However, changes in interest rates could impact the fair value (but not the carrying value) of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt. The potential decrease in fair value of the Company's fixed rate long-term debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% increase in U.S. Treasury rates, or approximately 15 basis points, is estimated to be $448 million as of December 31, 2021 and $428 million as of December 31, 2020. The underlying fair values of the Company's long-term debt were estimated based on quoted market prices or on the current rates offered for debt with similar terms and maturities.
