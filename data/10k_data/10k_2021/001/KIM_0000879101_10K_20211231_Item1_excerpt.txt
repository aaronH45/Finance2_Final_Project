PART I 

Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is North America’s largest publicly traded owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, including mixed-use assets. The terms “Kimco,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Kimco Realty Corporation and our subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. In statements regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), such terms refer solely to Kimco Realty Corporation. The Company’s mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. 

The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders. In 1973, these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company completed its initial public stock offering (the “IPO”) in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state taxes on its income, and the Company includes a provision for taxes in its consolidated financial statements. In 1994, the Company reorganized as a Maryland corporation. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S&P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company's common stock, Class L Depositary Shares and Class M Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbols “KIM”, “KIMprL”, and “KIMprM”, respectively. 

The Company is a self-administered REIT and has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. The Company’s ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company’s investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management. 

The Company began to expand its operations through the development of real estate and the construction of shopping centers but revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition and redevelopment of existing shopping centers that include a grocery component. The Company also expanded internationally within Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru, but has since exited all international investments. Additionally, the Company developed various residential and mixed-use operating properties and continues to obtain entitlements to embark on additional projects of this nature through re-development opportunities. More recently, in August 2021, the Company expanded through a merger with Weingarten Realty Investors (“Weingarten”) to further enhance its portfolio in coastal and sun belt regions, see further discussion below. 

The Company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests. The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics. 

In addition, the Company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company has also provided preferred equity capital to real estate professionals and, from time to time, provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets, however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets. 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had interests in 541 shopping center properties (the “Combined Shopping Center Portfolio”), aggregating 93.3 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), located in 29 states. In addition, the Company had 50 other property interests, primarily through the Company’s preferred equity investments and other investments, totaling 6.3 million square feet of GLA.

Weingarten Merger 

On August 3, 2021, Weingarten merged with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving public company (the “Merger”), pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) between the Company and Weingarten which was entered into on April 15, 2021. The Merger brought together two industry-leading retail real estate platforms with highly complementary portfolios and created the preeminent open-air shopping center and mixed-use real estate owner in the country. As a result of the Merger, the Company acquired 149 properties, including 30 held through joint venture programs. The increased scale in targeted growth markets, coupled with a broader pipeline of redevelopment opportunities, has positioned the combined company to create significant value for its shareholders. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, each Weingarten common share was entitled to 1.408 newly issued shares of the Company’s common stock plus $2.89 in cash, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Merger Agreement. 

On July 15, 2021, Weingarten’s Board of Trust Managers declared a special cash distribution of $0.69 per Weingarten common share (the “Special Distribution”) payable on August 2, 2021, to shareholders of record on July 28, 2021. The Special Distribution was paid in connection with the Merger and to satisfy REIT taxable income distribution requirements. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Weingarten’s payment of the Special Distribution adjusted the cash consideration paid by the Company at the closing of the Merger from $2.89 per Weingarten common share to $2.20 per Weingarten common share and had no impact on the payment of the share consideration of 1.408 newly issued shares of Company common stock for each Weingarten common share owned immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. In connection with the Merger the Company issued 179.9 million shares of common stock. See Footnote 2 to the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Merger. 

COVID-19 Pandemic 

The coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to impact the retail real estate industry for both landlords and tenants. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, in the near term, will continue to depend on future developments, which are uncertain at this time. The Company’s business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic, the distribution and effectiveness of vaccines, impacts on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response, the effects of the pandemic on the Company’s tenants and their businesses, the ability of tenants to make their rental payments, additional closures of tenants’ businesses and impacts of opening and reclosing of communities in response to the increase in positive COVID-19 cases. Any of these events could materially adversely impact the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price. The Company will continue to monitor the economic, financial, and social conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and will assess its asset portfolio for any impairment indicators. In addition, the Company will continue to monitor for any material or adverse effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. If the Company has determined that any of its assets are impaired, the Company would be required to take impairment charges, and such amounts could be material. 

The development and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines has assisted in allowing many restrictions to be lifted, providing a path to recovery. The U.S. economy continues to build upon the reopening trend as businesses reopen to full capacity and stimulus is flowing through to the consumer. The overall economy continues to recover but several issues including the lack of qualified employees, inflation risk, supply chain bottlenecks and COVID-19 variants have impacted the pace of the recovery.  

Business Objective and Strategies 

The Company has developed a strong nationally diversified portfolio of open-air, shopping centers located in drivable first-ring suburbs primarily within 20 major metropolitan sun belt and coastal markets, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the Company perceives significant barriers to entry. As of December 31, 2021, the Company derived 85% of its annualized base rent from these top major metro markets. The Company’s shopping centers provide essential, necessity-based goods and services to the local communities and are primarily anchored by grocery, home improvement, pharmacy and off-price tenants. 

The Company’s focus on high-quality locations has led to significant opportunities for value creation through the reinvestment in its assets to add density, replace outdated shopping center concepts, and better meet changing consumer demands. In order to add density to existing properties, the Company has obtained multi-family entitlements for 6,013 units of which 2,218 units have been constructed as of December 31, 2021. The Company continues to place strategic emphasis on live/work/play environments and in reinvesting in its existing assets, while building shareholder value. This philosophy is exemplified by the Company’s Signature SeriesTM properties Dania Pointe, Grand Parkway Marketplace, Kentlands Market Square, Lincoln Square, Mill Station, Pentagon Centre, Suburban Square, Cupertino Village, The Marketplace at Factoria, Westlake S.C. and The Boulevard. 

The strength and security of the Company’s balance sheet remains central to its strategy. The Company’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position are evidenced by its investment grade unsecured debt ratings (Baa1/BBB+) by two major ratings agencies. The Company maintains one of the longest average debt maturity profiles in the REIT industry, now at 8.5 years. The Company expects to continue to take steps to reduce leverage, unencumber assets and improve its debt coverage metrics as mixed-use projects and redevelopments continue to come online and contribute additional cash flow growth. 

Business Objective 

The Company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air, grocery-anchored shopping centers, including mixed-use assets, in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by: 

    ●   increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth;     

    ●   increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders while maintaining conservative payout ratios;     

    ●   improving debt metrics and upgraded unsecured debt ratings     

    ●   continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers, primarily focused on grocery anchors; and     

    ●   increasing the number of entitlements for residential use.

Business Strategies 

The Company believes with its strong core portfolio and its recent acquisitions, it will continue to achieve higher occupancy levels, increased rental rates and rental growth in the future. To effectively execute the Company’s strategy and achieve its strategic goals the Company identified the following growth components to focus on: 

Organic Growth – aim to incorporate annual rent increases for small shop leases and rental increases every five years for anchors.  

Leasing and Mark to Market Opportunities – focus on increasing occupancy across the entire portfolio including strong post-pandemic leasing volume. In addition, the Company will direct its attention on bringing historic below-market anchor leases closer to market rates. 

(Re)development and Repositioning Pipeline – economic stabilization of its Signature Series projects and obtaining additional multi-family entitlements where opportunity presents itself. 

Accretive Capital Deployment (Acquisitions, “Plus”/Structured Investments) – opportunistic acquisition and structured investment platform focused on accretive unique opportunities. 

Albertsons Monetization – monetize the Company’s marketable security investment while maintaining maximum optionality. 

ESG – strong commitments in the areas of climate change, Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) and small business support. 

The Company believes it is well positioned for sustainable growth with its high quality portfolio, which was most recently enhanced with the Weingarten merger, accretive and opportunistic capital allocation, financial strength and environmental, social and governance leadership.  

The Company has identified the following areas where it is well positioned for sustainable growth in the future. 

High Quality Portfolio & Operating Platform 

Deliver consistent funds from operations (“FFO”) growth from a portfolio of well-located, essential-anchored shopping centers and mixed-use assets. 

    ●   85% of the portfolio is anchored by grocery stores, home improvement and pharmacy tenants     

    ●   Located in the drivable first-ring suburbs of the Company’s top 20 major metropolitan sun belt and coastal markets     

Accretive & Opportunistic Capital Allocation 

Generate additional internal and external growth through accretive acquisitions, (re)development and "Plus"/Structured investments 

    ●   Opportunistic acquisition and structured investment platform ("Plus" business) focused on accretive unique opportunities     

    ●   The “Plus” business encompasses investment opportunities with retailers who have significant real estate holdings. The Company believes it can utilize its structured investment program to take advantage of opportunities resulting from market dislocation in the form of preferred equity investments and/or mezzanine financing for qualified real estate owners in need of capital     

Operating Platform 

Provide critical last-mile solutions to its diverse pool of tenants who continue to adapt and generate robust leasing demand. 

    ●   The demand for physical stores by omni-channel retailers has continued to increase     

    ●   Retail market recovery since the onset of COVID-19 has resulted in an increase in sales volume across most retail categories     

Environmental, Social & Governance (“ESG”) Leadership 

With over 60-years of delivering value to investors, tenants, employees, and communities. 

    ●   ESG approach is aligned with core business strategy     

    ●   Proactive approach to quantifying, disclosing and managing climate, reputational and other risks   

   ● Commitment to DE&I, ethics and governance best practices at the Board, Management, and employee levels    

Financial Strength 

Maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position with an emphasis on reduced leverage and a sustainable and growing dividend. The Company has: 

    ●   Over $2.3 billion of immediate liquidity, including the Company’s $2.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility     

    ●   Ownership of 39.8 million shares of Albertsons Companies, Inc. (valued at $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021)     

    ●   A 8.5 years consolidated debt maturity profile, one of the longest in the REIT industry     

    ●   Over 480 unencumbered properties, approximately 87% of the centers in the Company’s portfolio

 Table of Contents     

The Company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base. As of December 31, 2021, no single open-air shopping center accounted for more than 2.0% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest, or more than 2.0% of the Company’s total shopping center GLA. Furthermore, at December 31, 2021, the Company’s single largest tenant represented only 3.7%, and the Company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 11.7%, of the Company’s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. 

As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and the nation's largest owners and operators of open-air shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts. Management is associated with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry organizations. Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the Company’s properties. 

Government Regulation 

Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.

The Company also feels it is important that our associates are engaged and active in the community. At our headquarters and in each of our regions, a committee of employees host numerous volunteer and social activities that are derived from employee sentiment. Whether we’re participating in walks, runs, meal servings, food drives, toy drives, the Company promotes and supports associate volunteerism with two volunteer days off per year and a company matching program in support of each associates charitable endeavors. In addition, each year, the Company provides $100,000 in education scholarships for children of our associates, which is managed by an independent third-party.

The health and safety of the Company’s employees and their families is a top priority. The Company always takes the necessary steps to protect its employees, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic where employees were empowered to work from home and care for their family members and children. The Company will continue to evaluate individual situations as they arise and adjust its approach as appropriate, with the goal of enabling its employees to be as productive as possible while offering them the flexibility they need to care for themselves and their families. The following are steps that were taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic: 

    ●   The Company established a flexible work from home arrangement. This included immediate and extensive technology training on virtual meetings and remote working as well as safety protocols.     

    ●   The Company benefited from recent investments in new technology and software, as its entire team is equipped with new laptops and cellular capability to enable them to work remotely.     

    ●   The Company’s human resources and information technology teams are available to all employees to address any needs or concerns they may have.     

    ●   Associates are provided paid time off to care for themselves or family members diagnosed with COVID-19.   

   ● The Company has increased communications at all levels and established virtual meetings such that executives are accessible to answer any questions and transparently keep associates informed.     

Cybersecurity 

The Company’s Audit Committee receives quarterly briefings from the Company’s Chief Information Officer regarding the emerging cybersecurity threat and risk landscape as well as the Company's security program and related readiness, resiliency, and response efforts. 

The Company has a Cyber Risk Committee (“Cyber Committee”) which reviews and reports on technology-based security issues. The Cyber Committee is comprised of senior management from various business units within the Company and meets quarterly to review the status of the Company's overall security program as well as controls and procedures and to stay up-to-date of relevant legislative, regulatory and technical developments. 

The Company utilizes a variety of administrative, technical and physical safeguards that take into account the nature of our IT environment, information assets and cyber risks posed by both internal and external threats. The Company has incorporated cybersecurity coverage in its insurance policies. The Company's goal is to keep its data and systems, as well as its employees safe from cybersecurity threats. The Company is not aware of any information security breaches over the last three years. 

The Company has invested in employee security awareness training and also conducts internal phishing exercises. When potential security issues arise, the Company conducts a prompt investigation and analysis to determine what steps to take in response to protect the Company and its valued employees and key stakeholders. 

Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Programs 

The Company is focused on building a thriving and viable business, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for its stakeholders. The Company’s ESG programs are aligned with its core business strategy of creating destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to its many stakeholders.

The Company identified the following five pillars which outline the Company's strategic priorities within of our ESG program. This framework was enhanced in Februrary of 2021 with sixteen newly defined, comprehensive ESG goals. These goals expand upon our commitment with clear targets in each pillar: 

 The Company is committed to best-in-class ESG disclosure, and has aligned its annual reporting with standards from the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) (now known as the Value Reporting Foundation) and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). Additional ESG information of relevance to stakeholders can be found on the Company’s website, the contents of which are not incorporated by reference and do not form a part of this Form 10-K.  

The Company's Board of Directors (the “Board”) sets the Company's overall ESG program objectives and oversees enterprise risk management. The Nominating and Corporate Goverance Committee of the Board is responsible for ESG program oversight and performance evaluation. 

The Company recognizes that climate change is one of the most significant stakeholder issues of our times, threatening the viability of economic and environmental systems globally. The scientific community has studied climate change and a consensus exists that warming is occurring outside the boundaries of historical planetary trends due in significant part to human activity. As a real estate portfolio owner, the Company monitors physical and transition risks as well as opportunities posed to its business by climate change and quantifies and discloses the climate impacts of its activities. The Company’s science-based emissions reduction goals are aligned with the Paris Climate Accord which we believe put the company on pace to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

Climate risks and opportunities are evaluated at both the corporate and individual asset level. The following table summarizes relevant climate risks identified as a part of the Company’s ongoing risk assessment process. The Company may be subject to other climate risks not included below. 

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The Company’s approach in mitigating these risks include but are not limited to (i) carrying additional insurance coverage relating to flooding and windstorms, (ii) maintaining a geographically diversified portfolio, which limits exposure to event driven risks and (iii) creating a form “green lease” for its tenants which incorporates varied criteria that align landlord and tenant sustainability priorities as well as establishing green construction criteria. 

In 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million in 2.70% notes due 2030 in its inaugural green bond offering. The net proceeds from this offering are allocated to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, recently completed, existing or future eligible green projects, in alignment with the four core components of the Green Bond Principles, 2018 as administered by the International Capital Market Association. Additionally, the Company’s $2.0 billion Credit Facility (as defined below) is a green credit facility which incorporates rate adjustments associated with attainment (or nonattainment) of Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions reductions. 

The Company believes its industry leading ESG initiatives led to its 2021 listing on the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index (“DJSI North America Index”), designed for investors who recognize that sustainable business practices are critical to generating long-term shareholder value. The Company also is a constituent of the FTSE4Good Index Series, designed to measure the performance of companies related to ESG practices.
