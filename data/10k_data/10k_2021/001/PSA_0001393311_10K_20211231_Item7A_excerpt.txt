ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

To limit our exposure to market risk, we are capitalized primarily with preferred and common equity. Our preferred shares are redeemable at our option generally five years after issuance, but the holder has no redemption option. Our debt is our only market-risk sensitive portion of our capital structure, which totals approximately $7.5 billion at December 31, 2021. 

The fair value of our debt at December 31, 2021 is approximately $7.6 billion. The table below summarizes the annual maturities of our debt, which had a weighted average effective rate of 1.8% at December 31, 2021. See Note 7 to our December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our debt (amounts in thousands).

We have foreign currency exposure at December 31, 2021 related to (i) our investment in Shurgard, with a book value of $313.5 million, and a fair value of $2.0 billion based upon the closing price of Shurgard’s stock on December 31, 2021, and (ii) €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion) of Euro-denominated unsecured notes payable, providing a natural hedge against the fair value of our investment in Shurgard.
