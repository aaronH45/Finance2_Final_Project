Competition

Parker operates in highly competitive markets and industries. We offer our products over numerous, varied markets through our divisions operating in 45 countries. Our global scope means that we have hundreds of competitors across our various markets and product offerings. Our competitors include U.S. and non-U.S. companies. These competitors and the degree of competition vary widely by product lines, end markets, geographic scope and/or geographic locations. Although each of our segments has numerous competitors, given our market and product breadth, no single competitor competes with the Company with respect to all the products we manufacture and sell.

In the Diversified Industrial Segment, Parker competes on the basis of product quality and innovation, customer experience, manufacturing and distribution capability, and price competitiveness. We believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant Diversified Industrial Segment products. We have comprehensive motion and control packages for the broadest systems capabilities. While our primary global competitors include Bosch Rexroth AG, Danaher Corporation, Danfoss A/S, Donaldson Company, Inc., Emerson Climate Technologies, Inc., Emerson/ASCO, Festo AG & Co., Freudenberg-NOK, Gates Corporation, IMI/Norgren, SMC Corporation, Swagelok Company, and Trelleborg AB, none of these businesses compete with every group or product in our Diversified Industrial Segment.

In the Aerospace Systems Segment, we have developed relationships with key customers based on our advanced technological and engineering capabilities, superior performance in quality, delivery, service, and price competitiveness. This has enabled us to obtain significant original equipment business on new aircraft programs for our systems and components, as well as the follow-on repair and replacement business for these programs. Further, the Aerospace Systems Segment utilizes low-cost manufacturing techniques and best cost region strategies to achieve a lower cost producer status. Although we believe that we are one of the market leaders in most of the major markets for our most significant Aerospace Systems Segment products, primary global competitors for these products include Eaton Corporation plc, Honeywell International, Inc., Moog Inc., Triumph Group, Inc., Senior plc., Raytheon Collins Aerospace, Woodward, Inc. and Safran S.A.

We believe that our platform utilizing eight core technologies, which consist of electromechanical, filtration, fluid handling, hydraulics, pneumatics, process control, refrigeration, and sealing and shielding, is a positive factor in our ability to compete effectively with both large and small competitors. For both of our segments, we believe that the following factors also contribute to our ability to compete effectively:

•decentralized business model;

•technology breadth and interconnectivity;

•engineered products with intellectual property;

•long product life cycles;

•balanced OEM vs. aftermarket;

•low capital investment requirements; and

•great generators and deployers of cash over the cycle.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, Trade Secrets, Licenses

We own a number of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and licenses related to our products. We also have exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets owned by others. In addition, patent and trademark applications are pending, although there can be no assurance that further patents and trademarks will be issued. We do not depend on any single patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret or license or group of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets or licenses to any material extent.

Backlog and Seasonal Nature of Business

Backlog consists of written firm orders from a customer to deliver products and, in the case of blanket purchase orders, only includes the portion of the order for which a schedule or release date has been agreed to with the customer. The dollar value of backlog is equal to the amount that is expected to be billed to the customer and reported as a sale. Our backlog by business segment for the past two years is included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference. Our backlog was $7.9 billion at June 30, 2022 and $6.5 billion at June 30, 2021. Approximately 88 percent of our backlog at June 30, 2022 is scheduled for delivery in the succeeding twelve months. Because of the breadth and global scope of our business, our overall business is generally not seasonal in nature.

Environmental Regulation

Certain of our operations require the use and handling of hazardous materials and, as a result, the Company is subject to United States federal, state, and local laws and regulations as well as non-U.S. laws and regulations designed to protect the environment and regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws impose penalties, fines and other sanctions for non-compliance and liability for response costs, property damage and personal injury resulting from past and current spills, disposals or other releases of, or exposures to, hazardous materials. Among other environmental laws, we are subject to the United States federal "Superfund" law, under which we have been designated as a "potentially responsible party" and may be liable for cleanup costs associated with various waste sites, some of which are on the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund priority list.

As of June 30, 2022, Parker was involved in environmental remediation at various U.S. and non-U.S. manufacturing facilities presently or formerly operated by us and as a "potentially responsible party," along with other companies, at off-site waste disposal facilities and regional sites.

We believe that our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and the consequent financial liability to the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management efforts and expenditures by the Company. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations has not had in the past, and, we believe, will not have in the future, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Our reserve for environmental matters is discussed in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Government Regulation

In addition to the environmental regulations discussed above, we are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations relating to the development, manufacture, marketing, sale and distribution of our products and services in the countries where we conduct business. Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the dedication of time and effort of our team members, as well as financial resources. Additional information about the impact of government regulations on our business is included in “Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”

Energy Matters and Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

Our primary energy source for both of our business segments is electric power. While we cannot predict future costs of electric power, the primary source for production of the required electric power is expected to be coal and natural gas from coal and natural gas reserves available to electric utilities. We are subject to governmental regulations in regard to energy supplies in the United States and elsewhere. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions of our operations due to energy curtailments.

We primarily use steel, brass, copper, aluminum, nickel, rubber and thermoplastic materials and chemicals as the principal raw materials in our products. We expect these materials to be available from numerous sources in quantities sufficient to meet our requirements.

Acquisitions

The Company made no acquisitions in 2022. On August 2, 2021, the Company announced that it reached an agreement on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition (the "Acquisition") of the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Meggitt plc ("Meggitt"). The proposed Acquisition and prior year acquisitions are discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and are incorporated herein by reference.

Human Capital Management

At Parker, we align employment levels with the global needs of our business and our customers. As of June 30, 2022, we employed approximately 55,090 persons that we refer to as “team members,” of whom approximately 27,890 were employed by foreign subsidiaries. 

Our talented and passionate team members are the foundation of Parker’s enduring growth, bringing new ideas and perspectives to enhance our safety performance, improve productivity and inspire a diverse and inclusive culture. We see a clear path to a brighter future, and it begins with providing our people the resources that enable them to find personal and

professional satisfaction in their work, responsibly move our company forward and strengthen our communities, fulfilling our purpose of Enabling Engineering Breakthroughs that Lead to a Better Tomorrow.

The Win Strategy™ 3.0, Purpose and Values

The Win Strategy 3.0 is Parker’s business system that defines the goals and initiatives that drive growth, transformation and success. It works with our purpose, which is a foundational element of The Win Strategy, to engage team members and create responsible and sustainable growth.

The Win Strategy has four overarching goals: Engaged People, Customer Experience, Profitable Growth and Financial Performance, supported by our shared values of a Winning Culture, Passionate People, Valued Customers and Engaged Leadership. Our shared values shape our culture and our interactions with stakeholders and the communities in which we operate and live. 

Safety 

The safety and well-being of Parker team members is our highest priority. Our safety goal is simple: to achieve an incident-free workplace. We have reduced our Recordable Incident Rate by 72% and our Lost Time Incident Rate by 44% from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2022. In fiscal year 2022, the recordable incident rate per 100 team members was 0.39, compared to a recordable incident rate of 0.40 in fiscal year 2021. Our Lost Time Incident Rate in fiscal year 2022 was 0.15, compared to 0.14 per 100 team members in fiscal year 2021 (rates inclusive of recent acquisitions). 

Building on the great progress we have made, in 2021 we established new long-term safety goals. We intend to reach our goal of zero recordable incidents by 2030 through our continued focus on team member engagement and accountability, coupled with a strong framework of systems and procedures. 

To help support this goal we adopted eight standards aimed at preventing serious safety incidents or an environmental impact. We also developed a new field safety program that provides guidance for team members working outside our facilities to help them identify or anticipate safety risks. Further, for leading indicator corrective action we leverage a globally deployed Gensuite® operating platform in which proactive corrective action is managed and monitored and data analytics are employed to look for trends that can be proactively addressed to eliminate potential injury risk. 

We engage team members in improving safety performance through High Performance Teams ("HPTs"). All Parker manufacturing locations have an active, chartered Safety HPT and every value stream has a representative who is responsible for safety within their area of the business. This ownership culture at the manufacturing level is an integral component of our safety program. 

Engaged People

Engagement directly influences business performance. We strongly believe in empowering our team members to think as owners and take action to improve their areas of the business. Engagement is deeply ingrained in our culture, and as an overarching goal of The Win Strategy it is key to achieving top quartile financial performance. 

Parker activates engagement through our HPTs, which apply the expertise and perspective of team members who are closest to the product and customer to drive improvement throughout the company. Approximately 90% of our people participate in these teams, and more than 6,500 HPTs have already been established worldwide. We closely track our progress toward support of a high performing work environment through our Global Engagement Survey. Our fiscal year 2022 survey achieved a 91% response rate with an overall engagement score of 73%, a score which exceeds our key benchmarking data by 2%.

Talent Development

We have a well-defined talent development program managed through our Talent Central system, which connects all business units globally on a common platform and provides team members with visibility to skill development, career planning and learning opportunities. This shared platform is the catalyst for talent management at Parker.

Our review process enables us to assess talent globally, from early-in-career roles through senior leaders. This review facilitates the identification of key talent and allows us to build meaningful development plans and align career growth opportunities. The talent process is also supported by our Integrated Career System program which illustrates career paths for various roles and the steps to advance through the organization.

9
Supplementing the talent development process are Parker’s learning offerings, which help team members expand their professional skills and take ownership of their learning and development. Examples of center-led programs are our annual ethics and compliance training and cyber security training that all team members are required to complete, in addition to programs for developing supervisory and leadership skills. Functional-specific programs include HPT training, lean bootcamps and kaizen event orientations. Local and regional training includes site safety, equipment safety and site quality requirements. 

In addition to formal training programs, there are a host of development tools available which include mentoring relationships, coaching and feedback, job shadowing, project bubble assignments and other stretch projects.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DEI")

An inclusive environment is a core tenet of Parker’s values and one of our key measures of success within The Win Strategy. Throughout our history, we have been committed to building a welcoming and inclusive workplace that respects every team member’s unique perspective. Our team members come from a diverse range of personal and professional backgrounds, and their collective talent and expertise is the driving force behind the growth and success we have achieved. Our Commitment to DEI starts with our leadership and is reflected in our CEO’s statement: Continually Build Upon the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion of Our Global Team to be Reflective of the Communities in Which We Do Business.

A component of our DEI focus is to support the development and deployment of Business Resource Groups ("BRGs"). 

In 2015, we launched Peer W, our first BRG focused on supporting the recruitment, development and retention of women at Parker. Peer W has grown into a well-developed global network of 24 local chapters and established a Mentoring Circles program in 2020. In 2021, we introduced and launched two additional BRGs which are the Nia Network, supporting the attraction, development and retention of Black team members, and Parker Next, dedicated to our team members’ professional growth and personal development. 

We have also established four global HPTs focused on Talent Attraction, Talent Development, Governance and Knowledge. Each team is led by a senior executive and tasked with rethinking the way we attract and develop diverse team members, share knowledge and measure our progress in fostering an inclusive culture.

In 2020, Parker appointed its first Vice President of Diversity and Inclusion to lead our continuing journey. 

Compensation and Benefits

As a global employer, we are committed to offering competitive compensation and benefits, tailored in form and amount to geography, industry, experience and performance. Our programs are designed to attract team members, motivate and reward performance, drive growth and support retention. We provide benefit programs with the goal of improving physical, mental and financial wellness of our team members throughout their lifetime. Some examples include base and variable pay, health and insurance benefits, paid time off, and retirement saving plans.
