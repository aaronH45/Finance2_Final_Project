Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

PPG is exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce these market risks. A detailed description of these exposures and the Company’s risk management policies are provided in Note 10, “Financial Instruments, Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements” in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

The following disclosures summarize PPG’s exposure to market risks and information regarding the use of and fair value of derivatives employed to manage its exposure to such risks. Quantitative sensitivity analyses have been provided to reflect how reasonably possible, unfavorable changes in market rates could impact PPG’s consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

Foreign Currency Risk

We conduct operations in many countries around the world. Our results of operations are subject to both currency transaction and currency translation risk. Certain foreign currency forward contracts outstanding during 2021 and 2020 served as a hedge of a portion of PPG’s exposure to foreign currency transaction risk. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $24 million and $2 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The potential reduction in PPG’s Income before income taxes resulting from the impact of adverse changes in exchange rates on the fair value of its outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts of 10% for European and Canadian currencies and 20% for Asian and Latin American currencies for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 would have been $306 million and $226 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, PPG had U.S. dollar to euro cross currency swap contracts with notional amounts of $775 million and $875 million, respectively. The fair value of these contracts was a net asset of $50 million and a net liability of $8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. A 10% increase in the value of the euro to the U.S. dollar would have had an unfavorable effect on the fair value of these swap contracts by reducing the value of these instruments by $77 million and $95 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, PPG had non-U.S. dollar denominated debt outstanding of $1.6 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively. A weakening of the U.S. dollar by 10% against European currencies and by 20% against Asian and South American currencies would have resulted in unrealized translation losses of $178 million and $273 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company manages its interest rate risk by balancing its exposure to fixed and variable rates while attempting to minimize its interest costs. In the first quarter of 2018, PPG entered into interest rate swaps which converted $525 million of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. The fair value of these contracts was an asset of $36 million and $67 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. An increase in variable interest rates of 10% would lower the fair value of these swaps and increase interest expense $1 million for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. A 10% increase in interest rates in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and Europe and a 20% increase in interest rates in Asia and South America would have an insignificant effect on PPG’s variable rate debt obligations and interest expense for the periods ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Further, a 10% reduction in interest rates would have increased the fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt by approximately $56 million and $48 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; however, such changes would not have had an effect on PPG’s annual Income before income taxes or cash flows.
