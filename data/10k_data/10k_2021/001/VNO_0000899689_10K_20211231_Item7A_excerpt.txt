On April 7, 2021, Alexander's used its participation in the loan to reduce the loan balance.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. As of December 31, 2021, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $8,657,000,000. 

Derivatives and Hedging 

We utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The following table summarizes our consolidated derivative instruments, all of which hedge variable rate debt, as of December 31, 2021.
