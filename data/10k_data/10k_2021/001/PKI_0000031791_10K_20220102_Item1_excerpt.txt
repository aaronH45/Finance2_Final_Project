Intellectual Property

We own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.

In some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.

Competition

Due to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.

We compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.

Regulatory Affairs

Our operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of our product activities, and if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions; 

11
increased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products. 

We have agreements relating to the sale of our products and services to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, as well as other penalties.

We are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. In addition, changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards. 

If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Environmental Matters

Our operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include the handling, transportation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.

We may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.

We are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $11.9 million and $12.9 million as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.

We may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs. 

Human Capital Management

As of January 2, 2022, we employed approximately 16,700 employees on a worldwide basis. Roughly 75% of our workforce is based outside of the United States. Employees at several of our subsidiaries outside the United States belong to labor unions and/or workers' councils in those jurisdictions. During fiscal year 2021, our voluntary turnover rate was roughly 10%. We believe that management of our human capital resources is vital to the continued growth and success of the Company, 

12
and we endeavor to create an environment that encourages productivity, rewards performance and values diversity. There are several ways in which we attempt to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees, as set forth below.

Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, developing, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. We strive to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits, in a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We hold our employees to high performance standards and our compensation plans are designed to deliver competitive base pay and attractive incentive opportunities. Our benefits programs are specifically tailored to the various countries in which we operate and maintain a significant workforce. We benchmark for market practices and adjust our compensation and benefits programs to ensure they remain both equitable and competitive. 

Diversity and Inclusion

We believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. We have employees in more than 40 countries around the world. As of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, women comprised roughly 30% of our leadership positions on a global basis, which we define as director level and above. We provided further information regarding our diversity demographics in our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report and elsewhere on our website at www.perkinelmer.com, including from our consolidated EEO-1 report. An EEO-1 report is filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and describes the racial, ethnic and gender composition of our U.S.-based workforce. Information on our website, including the CSR Report and the consolidated EEO-1 report, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report.

We understand that our ability to operate in a multicultural world is critical to our long-term value creation. By maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion, we believe we can innovate more effectively. To that end, we seek to promote diverse perspectives throughout our organization and are an equal opportunity employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or other characteristics protected by law. 

Our commitment to diversity is evidenced by the establishment in 2020 of our internal Inclusion and Diversity Committee, which is comprised of a wide cross-section of leaders from all regions and backgrounds. The Committee focuses on driving increased diversity within our workforce, as well as creating a safe and engaging platform for dialogue on these issues for all our employees. Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment is further validated by our employees, as reflected in the results of our recent employee engagement survey, where we received high scores in the areas of Diversity & Inclusion, Inclusiveness, and Non-Discrimination. Among other comments, employees shared that they are proud of the emphasis PerkinElmer places on diversity and inclusion, and on making PerkinElmer a place where everyone is valued and respected.

Training and Development

We are committed to the continued development and training of our employees. We seek to provide our employees with meaningful learning opportunities to help grow their capabilities and careers. We provide learning through a variety of channels and formats, including formal (classroom-based, blended learning solutions, digital learning) and informal, on-the-job learning. We are also dedicated to our employees’ professional development, with a pivotal component of our annual performance review and goal-setting process focused on providing employees with constructive and actionable feedback, as well as management support and engagement in the creation and completion of development goals. Our training opportunities are designed to promote learning across all levels of our organization. We seek to provide opportunities for our employees to grow their careers and regularly fill open vacancies with internal candidates. In addition, management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development. We also provide formal and informal training opportunities for our employees covering a variety of professional, technical and leadership topics.

Health and Safety

Our success depends on the well-being of our employees, and one of our top priorities is to protect the health and safety of our employees. We maintain a culture focused on safety and strive to identify, eliminate, and control risk in the workplace to prevent injury and illness. Our employees have access to a global safety management system and are encouraged to report incidents, near misses, or other observations in the system. The system has been widely adopted in our manufacturing locations across the globe, and management uses the information generated by it to set safety-related policies and establish goals for future performance. Further, we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance and other resources that support their physical and mental well-being. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken, and we continue to take, proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners, 

13
and suppliers. We enacted rigorous safety measures, including social distancing protocols, encouraging employees who do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in a lab to perform their work from home, suspending non-essential travel, implementing temperature checks and other access controls at the entrances to our facilities, extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities. We expect to continue to implement these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend, or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.

Community

At PerkinElmer, we have long held the view that responsible global citizenship along with good governance principles and ethical business practices, are essential tenets for sustainability and success. We encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and where we operate, and to assist in that effort, we fund a long-term charitable matching program for our employees. In addition, we have established a group comprised of management and subject matter experts at our company, to focus on developing and delivering on measurable advancements in the areas of reducing waste, reducing carbon emissions, and improving employee engagement and diversity.
