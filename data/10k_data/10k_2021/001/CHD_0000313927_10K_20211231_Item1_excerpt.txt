PART I 

ITEM 1.  

BUSINESS 

OVERVIEW OF BUSINESS 

We were founded in 1846 and incorporated in Delaware in 1925. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of consumer household and personal care products and specialty products focused on animal and food production, chemicals and cleaners. Our consumer products marketing efforts are focused principally on our 14 “power brands.” These well-recognized brand names include ARM & HAMMER® baking soda, cat litter, laundry detergent, carpet deodorizer and other baking soda based products; TROJAN® condoms, lubricants and vibrators; OXICLEAN® stain removers, cleaning solutions, laundry detergents and bleach alternatives; SPINBRUSH® battery-operated toothbrushes; FIRST RESPONSE® home pregnancy and ovulation test kits; NAIR® depilatories; ORAJEL® oral analgesic; XTRA® laundry detergent; L’IL CRITTERS® and VITAFUSION® gummy dietary supplements for children and adults, respectively; BATISTE® dry shampoo; WATERPIK® water flossers and showerheads, FLAWLESS® products, ZICAM® cold shortening and relief products and THERABREATH® oral care products.  

We sell our consumer products under a variety of brands through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar and other discount stores, pet and other specialty stores and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. We sell our specialty products to industrial customers, livestock producers and through distributors. 

Our Sustainability Strategy and Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Pillars 

We believe that sustainable operations are both financially and operationally beneficial to our business, and critical to the health of the communities in which we operate, while contributing to a better world. Sustainability is how we refer to our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) efforts as part of our overall success in delivering growth and profitability while making a meaningful and positive impact. Each year we publish a Sustainability Report that discloses our business and corporate responsibility commitments by detailing our ESG performance metrics and targets and other components of our ESG efforts. Our 2020 Sustainability Report is available on our web site at https://churchdwight.com/pdf/Sustainability/2020-Sustainability-Report.pdf, and our 2021 Sustainability Report will be available in April 2022 (the “2021 Sustainability Report” and together with the 2020 Sustainability Report, the “Sustainability Reports”). References to our Sustainability Reports are for informational purposes only and neither the Sustainability Reports nor the other information on our website is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Our global sustainability strategy is derived from our heritage and organizational values. The following six pillars are the core focus of our Environmental and Social efforts. Each is supported through our Governance practices which are intended to maintain a system of rules and practices that determine how we operate and align the interests of our stakeholders in support of ethical business practices and financial success.  

•  

Our Brands: Delight consumers with our brands and contribute towards a more sustainable world 

•  

Products: Provide safe and effective products for consumers and the environment 

•  

Packaging: Utilize consumer friendly and environmentally responsible packaging 

•  

Employees and Communities: Embrace the principles of diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), good corporate citizenship and social responsibility within the communities we can impact 

•  

Environment: Minimize environmental impact of our global operations, with a focus on increased renewable energy usage, reduced water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and solid waste to landfills 

•  

Responsible Sourcing: Improve our suppliers’ environmental, labor, health & safety and ethical practices 

Environmental. Our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations relating to environmental concerns, including air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste management activities, and the safety of our employees. We endeavor to take actions necessary to comply with such regulations. These steps include periodic environmental and health and safety audits of our facilities. The audits, conducted by independent firms with expertise in environmental, health and safety compliance, include site visits at each location, as well as a review of documentary information, to determine compliance with such federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations. However, our environmental priorities extend well beyond our compliance efforts, and include our focus on providing safe and effective products for consumers and the environment, utilizing consumer friendly and environmentally responsible  

4 

packaging, achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions, reducing water usage, recycling waste and solid waste and improving our suppliers’ environmental practices. 

Social. Our Social focus areas include our goals of delighting consumers with our brands through our contributions towards a more sustainable world, improving our suppliers’ labor, health & safety and ethical practices, and supporting our employees to create a stronger, more resilient company while contributing to a better world. In their everyday work, employees embody our core values of integrity, quality, commitment, and innovation, and in doing so, directly contribute to our long-standing character and reputation. Employee safety is a top priority. We develop and administer company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each team member and compliance with OSHA standards and have implemented COVID-19 protocols across all locations to ensure both the safety of our employees and compliance with federal and local requirement and guidelines. We embrace the diversity of our employees and believe that a diverse workforce reflective of our consumer base fosters innovation and cultivates an environment filled with unique perspectives and strive to cultivate a culture and processes that support and enhance our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. As part of our enhanced diversity and inclusion initiatives that began in 2020, we intend to publish workplace demographics of our employees in our 2021 Sustainability Report. We also encourage our employees to become involved in their communities through our Employee Giving Fund and The Church & Dwight Philanthropic Foundation (the “Foundation”) which is focused on helping to create DEI opportunities and advancing environmental preservation. The Foundation is administered by our employees. See pages 12-13 in this Item 1 of this Annual Report under “Employees and Human Capital” for a discussion of our human capital management. 

Governance. Our governance focus includes the processes, rules, resources and systems in support of our operational, sustainability and ESG efforts, have been described in our 2021 Proxy Statement and will be described in our Proxy Statement for our upcoming Annual Meeting of Stockholders under the caption “Sustainability Strategy and ESG Pillars” and in our 2021 Sustainability Report. Our Corporate Issues Council (the “Council”), comprised of senior executives representing all of our key functional areas, guides the integration of sustainability with all parts of our business and drives continuous improvement in our sustainability approach and performance. The Council takes the lead in defining and implementing our sustainability strategies across the six sustainability and ESG pillars. Our Board of Directors, acting principally through its Governance, Nominating & Corporate Responsibility Committee, oversees our sustainability efforts, with that Committee and the Compensation & Human Capital and Audit Committees each focusing on specified areas of sustainability, including compliance and ethics, human capital and DEI. Our Independent Lead Director is responsible for ensuring that stockholder requests, recommendations and proposals are evaluated by the Governance, Nominating & Corporate Responsibility Committee, additional committees within the Board as appropriate, and then by the Board of Directors, if needed. 

As described in our Sustainability Reports, our continued progress in key areas of ESG has earned recognition from various third parties.  

We use the standards and guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board industry specific standards and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to inform our sustainability and ESG disclosures included in this Annual Report, our Proxy Statement and our Sustainability Reports. The “materiality” thresholds in those standards and guidelines may differ from the concept of “materiality” for purposes of the federal securities laws and disclosures required by the Commission’s rules in this Annual Report. Moreover, the inclusion of sustainability and ESG disclosures in this Annual Report and in our other filings with the Commission does not necessarily imply that we consider them to be material for purposes of the federal securities laws or the Commission’s rules and regulations governing such disclosure.  

 FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT SEGMENTS AND PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS 

As discussed in more detail below, we operate in three principal segments: Consumer Domestic, Consumer International, and our Specialty Products Division (“SPD”). Refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the discussion in “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for information concerning the results of each of our segments.   

All domestic brand “rankings” contained in this Annual Report are based on dollar share rankings from Information Resources, Inc. (“IRI”) Total US – MULO for the period ending December 26, 2021. Foreign brand “rankings” are derived from several sources. 

Recent Acquisitions 

On December 24, 2021, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of Dr. Harold Katz, LLC and HK-IP International, Inc., the owners of the THERABREATH® brand of oral care products (the “TheraBreath Acquisition”). We paid $556.0 million, net of cash acquired, at closing and deferred an additional cash payment of $14.0 million related to certain indemnity obligations provided by the seller. The additional amount, to the extent not used in satisfaction of such indemnity obligations, is payable in installments between two and four years from the closing. THERABREATH’s annual net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately $100 million. The acquisition was financed by the proceeds from a $400.0 million three-year term loan and an underwritten public offering of $400.0 million aggregate principal Senior Notes due on December 15, 2031 (as defined below under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 of this Annual Report) completed on December 10, 2021. The THERABREATH business is managed in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments.

Consumer Domestic 

Our founders first marketed sodium bicarbonate, otherwise known as baking soda, in 1846 for use in home baking. Today, this product has a wide variety of uses in the home, including as a refrigerator and freezer deodorizer, scratch-free cleaner and deodorizer for kitchen surfaces and cooking appliances, bath additive, dentifrice, cat litter deodorizer and swimming pool pH stabilizer. We specialize in baking soda-based products, as well as other products which use the same raw materials or technology or which are sold in the same markets. Our Consumer Domestic segment includes each of our 14 power brands, as well as other well-known brands and household and personal care products. We divide the Consumer Domestic segment into household and personal care product groups.  

Household Products  

In 2021, household products constituted approximately 53% of our Consumer Domestic sales and approximately 41% of our consolidated net sales.  

ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda remains the number one leading brand of baking soda in terms of consumer recognition of the brand name and reputation for quality and value. The cleaning and deodorizing properties of baking soda have led to the development of numerous baking soda-based household products. For example, we market ARM & HAMMER FRIDGE FRESH®, a refrigerator deodorizer equipped with a baking soda filter to help keep food tasting fresher, and ARM & HAMMER Carpet Deodorizer. Our other primary household products include laundry detergents marketed under the ARM & HAMMER, OXICLEAN and XTRA brands, fabric softener sheets marketed under the ARM & HAMMER brand, cat litter under our ARM & HAMMER brand, and household cleaning products under the CLEAN SHOWER®, SCRUB FREE®, ORANGE GLO®, OXICLEAN and KABOOM® brands. Our laundry detergents constitute our largest consumer business, measured by net sales.  

Personal Care Products 

In 2021, personal care products constituted approximately 47% of our Consumer Domestic sales and approximately 35% of our consolidated net sales. 

Our personal care business was founded on the unique strengths of our ARM & HAMMER trademark and baking soda technology. We have expanded our personal care business through the acquisition of antiperspirants, oral care products, depilatories, reproductive health products, oral analgesics, nasal saline moisturizers, and dietary supplements under a variety of other leading brand names.  

ARM & HAMMER Baking Soda, when used as a dentifrice, helps whiten and polish teeth, removes plaque and leaves the mouth feeling fresh and clean. These properties led to the development of a complete line of sodium bicarbonate-based dentifrice products that are marketed and sold nationally primarily under the ARM & HAMMER brand name. Our other personal care products include antiperspirants and deodorants under the ARRID® and ARM & HAMMER brands, condoms under the TROJAN brand (the number one condom brand in the U.S.), battery-operated toothbrushes under the SPINBRUSH brand (the number two leading brand of battery-operated toothbrushes in the U.S. in 2021), water flossers and showerheads under the WATERPIK brand (the number one water flosser and replacement showerhead brand in the U.S.), home pregnancy and ovulation test kits under the FIRST RESPONSE brand (the number two selling brand in the U.S.), hair-removal products under the NAIR brand (the number one depilatory in the U.S.), FLAWLESS and FINISHING TOUCH brands (the number one women’s electric hair removal system in the U.S.), oral analgesics and oral care products under the ORAJEL brand (the number one oral care pain relief in the U.S.), children’s gummy dietary supplements under the L’IL CRITTERS brand and adult gummy dietary supplements under the VITAFUSION brand (both number one leading brands in their respective categories), ZICAM brand (the number one cold shortening category in the U.S. ), a growing number of hair products under the BATISTE (the number one dry shampoo in the U.S.), VIVISCAL (the number one leading supplement for thinning hair), TOPPIK® (the number one leading brand of cosmetics for thinning hair), THERABREATH (the number two alcohol free mouthwash in the U.S.), and XFUSION® brands, and nasal saline moisturizers and solutions under the SIMPLY SALINE® brand.  

Consumer International 

Our Consumer International segment markets a variety of personal care, household and over-the-counter products in international subsidiary markets, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom and in over 130 global export markets around the world, including China and Japan (the “Global Markets Group” or “GMG”).  

Total Consumer International net sales represented approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales in 2021. Net sales of the subsidiary businesses originating in Europe, Canada, Australia and Mexico accounted for 33%, 26%, 8% and 7%, respectively, of our 2021 international net sales in this segment. No other country in which we operate accounts for more than 20% of our total international net sales and no product line accounts for more than 20% of total international net sales. 

Some of our U.S. power brands such as ARM & HAMMER, BATISTE, NAIR, OXICLEAN, TROJAN, L’IL CRITTERS, SPINBRUSH, WATERPIK, FLAWLESS and VITAFUSION are distributed in many of our international markets. In addition, we also export unique  

6 

brands such as STERIMAR®, a natural nasal decongestant and FEMFRESH®, a feminine hygiene portfolio out of the United Kingdom, to many countries around the world. 

We also market the CURASH® line of babycare products in Australia, and GRAVOL® anti-nauseant and RUB-A535 topical analgesic in Canada and other international markets. We also sell WATERPIK water flossers and showerheads in Australia, Canada, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Mexico and in other international markets. 

Specialty Products Division  

Our SPD segment focuses on sales to businesses and participates in three product areas: Animal and Food Production, Specialty Chemicals and Specialty Cleaners, and accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated net sales in 2021.   

Animal and Food Production Products  

Since the ARM & HAMMER Animal and Food Production business began in 1972, with its launch of ARM & HAMMER baking soda as a feed additive to help dairy cows produce more milk, we have built a leading portfolio of nutritional supplements designed to help improve the health and productivity of dairy cows. Today our portfolio of dairy nutritional supplements includes brands such as MEGALAC® rumen bypass fat– a supplement made from natural oils – which enables cows to maintain energy levels during the period of high milk production, resulting in improved milk yields. In addition, we market a line of high-quality protein and amino acid products, including BIO-CHLOR® and FERMENTEN®, which are designed to help reduce health issues associated with calving, as well as provide needed protein to ensure proper growth and milk production. 

Over the last five years, we have expanded our product offerings to include unique prebiotics and probiotics. CELMANAX® Refined Functional Carbohydrate is a yeast-based prebiotic that helps ensure a well-functioning gastrointestinal track in dairy cows, beef cattle, poultry and other livestock. On May 1, 2017, we acquired the Agro Biosciences, Inc. business and we now market the CERTILLUS® family of probiotics products in the poultry, dairy, beef and swine industries. On March 8, 2018, we acquired Passport Food Safety Solutions, Inc., focused on providing pre- and post-harvest food safety solutions for beef, poultry, and swine primarily for the application to carcasses to reduce food borne pathogens. 

Specialty Chemicals 

Our specialty chemicals business primarily encompasses the manufacture, marketing and sale of sodium bicarbonate in a range of grades and granulations for use in industrial markets. In industrial markets, sodium bicarbonate is used by other manufacturing companies as a leavening agent for commercial baked goods, as an antacid in pharmaceuticals, as a carbon dioxide release agent in fire extinguishers, as an alkaline agent in swimming pool chemicals, and as a buffer in kidney dialysis.  

We and Occidental Chemical Corporation are equal partners in a joint venture, Armand Products Company, which manufactures and markets potassium carbonate and potassium bicarbonate for sale in domestic and international markets. The potassium-based products are used in a wide variety of applications, including agricultural products, specialty glass and ceramics, and potassium silicates. Armand also manufactures a potassium carbonate-based animal feed additive for sale by us in the dairy industry, described above under “Animal and Food Production Products.” Armand’s results are included in our Corporate segment.  

Specialty Cleaners 

We also provide a line of cleaning and deodorizing products for use in commercial and industrial applications such as office buildings, hotels, restaurants and other facilities. 

We and Safety-Kleen Systems, Inc. (“Safety-Kleen”) are equal partners in a joint venture, ARMAKLEEN®, which has built a specialty cleaning products business based on our technology and Safety-Kleen’s sales and distribution organization. In North America, this joint venture distributes our proprietary product line of aqueous cleaners along with our ARMEX® blast media line, which is designed for the removal of a wide variety of surface coatings. These results are included in our Corporate segment.  

COMPETITION 

We compete in the household and personal care consumer product categories, which are highly innovative categories, characterized by a continuous flow of new products and line extensions, and require significant advertising and promotion. We compete in these categories primarily on the basis of product innovation and performance, brand recognition, price, value and other consumer benefits. Consumer products, particularly laundry and dietary supplements, are subject to significant price competition. As a result, we, from time to time, may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share. Product introductions typically involve heavy marketing and trade spending in the year of launch, and we usually are not able to determine whether  

7 

the new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of the new products or the extension of the product line. 

Because of the competitive retail environment, we face pricing pressure from our retail customers and customers selling through other channels, particularly high-volume retail customers including, internet-based retailers, who have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms that could reduce our margins. Furthermore, if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms acceptable to our customers, they could increase product purchases from competitors and reduce purchases from us, which would harm our sales and profitability. 

Our competitors in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments include, among others, Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”), The Clorox Company, Colgate-Palmolive Company, S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., Nestle Purina PetCare Company and Nestle Health Science, Henkel, Reckitt Benckiser Group plc, Johnson & Johnson, Ansell Limited, Pfizer Inc., Bayer AG, Alere Inc., NBTY, Inc., Koninklijke Philips N.V., Unilever PLC, Sanofi and Pharmavite LLC. Many of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and have the capacity to outspend us in their attempts to gain market share. In addition, the growing number of sales channels and business models, such as niche brands, internet-only brands and retailer co-developed and owned brands, have increased competition in certain product categories, particularly within personal care, specialty hair care and dietary supplements, from less well capitalized competitors.  

Competition within our animal and food production and our specialty chemicals product lines is intense. The specialty chemicals business operates in a competitive environment influenced by capacity utilization, customers’ leverage and the impact of raw material and energy costs. Product introductions typically involve introductory educational costs in the year of launch, and we usually are not able to determine whether new products and line extensions will be successful until a period of time has elapsed following the introduction of new products or the extension of the product lines. Our key competitors with respect to our SPD segment are Cargill Incorporated, Lallemand Inc., Solvay Chemicals, Inc., Genesis Alkali and Natural Soda, Inc. For additional discussion of the competitive environment in which we conduct our business, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors." 

DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PRODUCTS 

Our Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments products are marketed primarily through a broad distribution platform that includes supermarkets, mass merchandisers, wholesale clubs, drugstores, convenience stores, home stores, dollar and other discount stores, pet and other specialty stores, and websites and other e-commerce channels, all of which sell our products to consumers. The Consumer Domestic Segment employs a sales force based regionally throughout the U.S. and utilizes the services of independent brokers, who represent our products in the food, mass, pet, dollar, club, and numerous other classes of trade. Our Consumer International segment conducts business through subsidiaries and global export markets. Our subsidiaries employ local sales and marketing teams that manage the retailer and trade relationships while export sales and marketing professionals also manage an extensive distributor network in our global export markets. Our products are stored in our plants and third-party owned warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities.  

SPD markets sodium bicarbonate and other chemicals to industrial and agricultural customers primarily throughout the U.S. and Canada. Distribution is accomplished through a dedicated sales force supplemented by manufacturers’ representatives and independent distributors. Our products in this segment are stored in our plants and public warehouses and are either delivered by independent trucking companies or picked up by customers at our facilities. 

SEASONALITY 

Our business is generally not seasonal, although the Consumer Domestic and Consumer International segments are affected by sales of SPINBRUSH battery-operated toothbrushes and WATERPIK water flossers (which typically are higher during the fall, in advance of the holiday season), sales of NAIR depilatories and waxes (which typically are higher in the spring and summer months), sales of VITAFUSION and L’IL CRITTERS dietary supplements and ZICAM cold shortening and relief category products (which typically are slightly higher in the fourth quarter of each year, in advance of the cold and flu season and renewed commitments to health), and sales of FLAWLESS (which are typically higher in the second half of the year). In SPD, several of our Animal and Food Production products experience higher demand in warmer weather months creating higher seasonal demand in the second and third quarters of the year.  

RAW MATERIALS AND SOURCES OF SUPPLY 

We manufacture sodium bicarbonate for our consumer and specialty products businesses at our plants located at Green River, Wyoming and Old Fort, Ohio. The primary source of soda ash, a basic raw material used in the production of sodium bicarbonate, is the mineral trona, which is found in abundance in southwestern Wyoming near our Green River plant. We have adequate trona reserves under mineral leases to support our sodium bicarbonate requirements for the foreseeable future.  

We are a party to a partnership agreement with Tata Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners, which mines and processes trona reserves in Wyoming. We fulfill a substantial amount of our soda ash requirements through the partnership and related supply and services agreements, enabling us to achieve some of the economies of an integrated business capable of producing sodium bicarbonate and related products from the basic raw  

8 

material.  We also have an agreement for the supply of soda ash from another company.  The partnership agreement and other supply agreements between the Tata Chemicals (Soda Ash) Partners and us are terminable upon two years notice by either of us. We believe that sufficient alternative sources of soda ash supply are available. 

We believe that ample sources of raw materials are available for all our other major products. Detergent chemicals are used in a variety of our products and are available from a number of sources. Bottles, paper products and clay are available from multiple suppliers, although we choose to source most of these materials from single sources under long-term supply agreements in order to gain favorable economies of scale. We also use certifiable sustainable palm oil derivatives in a number of products, including primarily in our rumen bypass fats products. Alternative sources of supply are available in case of the disruption or termination of the supply agreements. 

The cost of raw materials, including surfactants, diesel fuel and oil-based raw and packaging materials used primarily in our consumer businesses, were higher in 2021 relative to 2020, increasing our core commodity costs. Increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our costs and financial results if we are unable to pass such costs along in the form of price increases to our customers. 

We utilize the services of third party contract manufacturers around the world for certain products.  

PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS 

Our trademarks appear in upper case letters throughout this Annual Report. The majority of our trademarks are registered with either the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or with the trademark offices of many foreign countries. The ARM & HAMMER trademark has been used by us since 1867 and is a valuable asset and important to the successful operation of our business. Our products are sold under many other valuable trademarks held by us, including TROJAN, NAIR, ORAJEL, WATERPIK, FIRST RESPONSE, XTRA, OXICLEAN, SPINBRUSH, BATISTE, SIMPLY SALINE, L’IL CRITTERS, VITAFUSION, FLAWLESS, ZICAM and THERABREATH. Our portfolio of trademarks represents substantial value in the businesses using the trademarks. 

U.S. patents are currently granted for a term of 20 years from the date the patent application is filed. Although we actively seek and maintain a number of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.  

CUSTOMERS AND ORDER BACKLOG  

In each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net sales to our largest customer, Walmart Inc. and its affiliates (“Walmart”), were 24%, 23% and 24% respectively, of our consolidated net sales. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales in the three-year period. The time between receipt of orders and shipment is generally short, and as a result, backlog is not significant.  

GOVERNMENT REGULATION 

General 

Some of our products are subject to regulation by one or more U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) and foreign agencies.  

FDA regulations govern a variety of matters relating to our products, such as product development, manufacturing, premarket clearance or approval, labeling and distribution. The regulations adopted and standards imposed by the FDA and similar foreign agencies evolve over time and can require us to make changes in our manufacturing processes and quality systems to remain in compliance. These agencies periodically inspect manufacturing and other facilities. If we fail to comply with applicable regulations and standards, we may be subject to sanctions, including fines and penalties, the recall of products and cessation of manufacturing and/or distribution.  

In addition, we sell products that are subject to regulation under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, both of which are administered by the EPA.  

We are also subject to regulation by the FTC in connection with the content and truthfulness of our labeling, advertising, promotion, trade practices and other matters. The FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of otherwise false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties and/or restitution by the companies involved. Such actions can result in substantial financial penalties and significantly restrict the marketing of our products. 

The CPSC has jurisdiction over consumer products, regulates their safety and has authority over recalls. The CPSC administers the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and has issued regulations requiring special child resistant packaging for certain products, including pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and dietary substances, containing certain ingredients (e.g., iron). 

9 

Our relationship with certain union employees is regulated by various agencies of the countries, states, provinces and other localities in which we sell our products.  

Medical Device Clearance and Approval  

To be commercially distributed in the U.S., a medical device must, unless exempt, receive clearance or approval from the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). For lower risk class II devices, we must generally submit a premarket notification requesting clearance for commercial distribution known as a “510(k)” clearance. Our condoms, lubricants, contact lens solution, wound wash, home pregnancy test kits and WATERPIK professional dental products are regulated as class II devices. Some other low risk devices, including SPINBRUSH and other battery powered toothbrushes, and WATERPIK water flossers, are in class I and are generally exempted from the 510(k) requirements. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a device must be determined to be substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a benchmark device, or “predicate” that is already legally in commercial distribution. Any modification to a 510(k) cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a change in its intended use, generally requires a new 510(k) clearance. We may determine that a new 510(k) clearance is not required, but if the FDA disagrees, it may retroactively require a 510(k) clearance and may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance is obtained.  

OTC Pharmaceutical 

We market over-the-counter (“OTC”) pharmaceutical products, such as toothpaste, antiperspirant, and oral analgesics products, that are also subject to FDA and foreign regulation. Under the U.S. OTC monograph system, selected OTC pharmaceutical products are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of a new drug application. The FDA OTC monographs include well-known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels. Pharmaceutical products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula and labeling requirements. Products not in the monograph system can be deemed to be unapproved new drugs and can be forced from the market. This is particularly the case for homeopathic drug products like certain ZICAM products. Both the FDA and the FTC have taken the position that homeopathic products are unapproved new drugs. Regulatory action against these products is deemed unlikely unless the products present an unreasonable safety risk. ZICAM homeopathic products are not currently perceived to pose any such risk. 

All facilities where OTC pharmaceutical products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored or distributed must comply with cGMP regulations and/or regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries where the facilities are located. All of our pharmaceutical products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representations made to customers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility, such as seizure, injunction or recall. Serious product quality concerns could also result in governmental actions against us that, among other things, could result in the suspension of production or distribution of our products, product seizures, loss of certain licenses or other governmental penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results. We are required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of our OTC pharmaceutical products marketed in the U.S.  

We cannot predict whether new legislation regulating our activities will be enacted or what effect any legislation would have on our business. 

Medical Device and OTC Pharmaceutical Postmarket Regulation 

After a medical device and/or OTC pharmaceutical is commercialized, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

10 

Food Products 

We market baking soda and animal feed products, such as rumen fermentation enhancers and Dietary Cation-Anion Difference (“DCAD”) balancers that are also subject to FDA and foreign regulation. The Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”) regulates food and animal feed products and mandates preventive controls, including hazard analysis, risk controls, supplier qualifications and controls and increased record keeping. FSMA grants the FDA the authority to require mandatory recalls for products under certain conditions. The FDA is currently in the process of establishing rules and guidance to implement the provisions of FSMA. The potential impact of these rules and applicable guidance cannot be determined now. 

Dietary Supplements 

The processing, formulation, safety, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, distribution, importing, selling, and storing our gummy vitamin dietary supplements are subject to regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the CPSC, the EPA, and by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. The FDCA governs the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements.  

It is unlawful to market as a dietary supplement any article that is approved as a new drug or is authorized for investigation as a new drug for which substantial clinical investigations have been instituted and made public, unless that article was first marketed as a dietary supplement or food. The FDA has authority to effectively void that restriction through the issuance of a regulation finding the article lawful. To date, the FDA has not exercised that rulemaking authority for any article. 

Dietary ingredients that were not marketed in the U.S. before October 15, 1994 must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing, unless the ingredient has been present in the food supply as an article used for food without being chemically altered. The notification must provide evidence of a history of use or other evidence establishing that use of the dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. The FDA may determine that notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a new ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe, which could effectively prevent the marketing of the ingredient. In August of 2016, the FDA issued draft guidance governing notification of new dietary ingredients. Although the draft guidance was issued for public comment and not for implementation, it is a strong indication of the FDA’s current thinking on the topics discussed in the guidance, including the FDA’s approach to enforcement. If the FDA enforces the applicable statutes and regulations in accord with the draft guidance, that could effectively change the status of dietary ingredients that the industry has marketed as “old” dietary ingredients to “new” dietary ingredients and may require submission of a new dietary ingredient notification.  

A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess information substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. If the FDA determines that a particular statement of nutritional support is an unacceptable drug claim or an unauthorized version of a health claim, or if the FDA determines that a particular claim is not adequately supported by existing scientific evidence or is otherwise false or misleading, the claim could not be used and any product bearing the claim could be subject to regulatory action. 

The FDA’s cGMP regulations govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. As with OTC products, the FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our dietary supplement facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. The failure of a facility to be in compliance may lead to a breach of representation made to consumers or to regulatory action against us related to the products made in that facility, seizure, injunction or recall. There is considerable uncertainty with respect to the FDA’s interpretation and implementation of the cGMP regulations. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations may render products manufactured in that facility adulterated and subjects those products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions. The manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a dietary supplement marketed in the U.S. whose name appears on the label of the supplement is required to report serious adverse events associated with the use of that supplement to the FDA.  

Additional legislation may be introduced which, if passed, would impose substantial new regulatory requirements on dietary supplements. The effect of additional domestic or international governmental legislation, regulations, or administrative orders, if and when promulgated, cannot be determined. New legislation or regulations may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards and require the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation.

HUMAN CAPITAL 

Overview 

We take great pride in fostering an enduring culture among our employees that seeks to make meaningful contributions to society.  

Safety and Wellness 

Employee safety remains our top priority. We develop and administer company-wide policies to ensure the safety of each team member and compliance with OSHA standards. In 2020, we implemented COVID-19 protocols across all locations in response to the pandemic, to ensure both the safety of our employees and compliance with federal and local requirement and guidelines. 

Our Employees 

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 5,100 global employees, an increase of approximately 30 compared to December 31, 2020. The increase is primarily due to increased staffing at our global manufacturing plants. Approximately 87.1% of our workforce is located in the Americas, 9.8% in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and 3.1% in the Asia-Pacific region. About 48.6% of our employees are salaried and about 51.4% are paid hourly wages. During fiscal 2021, our turnover rate was approximately 20.6%. Our revenue per employee in fiscal 2021 was approximately $1.0 million.  

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

We embrace the diversity of our employees and, our DEI efforts aspire to help us achieve a more diverse workforce. Also we strive to cultivate a culture and processes that support and enhance our ability to recruit, develop and retain diverse talent at every level. 

As a company we remain committed to fair treatment, access, opportunity, and advancement, while at the same time striving to identify and eliminate barriers that have prevented the full participation of underrepresented groups.  

In 2020, we established a Diversity & Inclusion Council that provides strategic direction, guidance and advocacy for our DEI initiatives which is led by our Chief Executive Officer and our Director, Diversity & Inclusion and includes diverse employees at every level from around the world. Our Board of Directors, acting principally through its Compensation & Human Capital Committee, oversees our DEI efforts. 

We are committed to transparency and accountability that will drive continuous progress. As part of our enhanced diversity and inclusion initiatives that began in 2020, we will publish workplace demographics of our employees in our 2021 Sustainability Report. 

Hiring, Development and Retention 

Our talent strategy is focused on attracting the best talent and recognizing and rewarding performance, while continually developing, engaging and retaining our talented employees.  

We invest resources in professional development and growth as a means of improving employee performance and improving retention. This includes our bi-annual “LEAP” (Leadership Empowerment Achievement Program), which is aimed at continuous learning, professional training and development opportunities, targeted leadership development courses for new and existing leaders of different levels of seniority, tuition reimbursement, and job specific programs for our employees.  

Compensation and Benefits 

As part of our overall effort to attract, develop and retain talented employees, our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our Company and their individual performance, and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. Moreover, our policies and procedures are designed to ensure compensation is fair for employees of the same job, at the same level, location and performance. These include utilizing pay grades for appropriate job groupings, making pay decisions based on relevant factors, such as education, experience, and performance, and subjecting pay decisions to higher levels of leadership and Human Resources review to ensure those decisions are fair, equitable and align with our equal employment opportunity policies and objectives.  

Employees are eligible for health insurance, prescription drug benefits, dental, vision, hospital indemnity, accident, critical illness, and disability insurance, life insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, reproductive rights coverage, participation in savings plans, and identity theft insurance, in each case subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable plans and programs.

Communities 

We encourage our employees to become involved in their communities, and in 2021, our Employee Giving Fund supported our communities by providing $1.2 million to 225 deserving community organizations through annual grants, disaster relief, and other monetary support. Employees purchased back-to-school supplies online to support disadvantaged youth, donated clothes and non-perishable items for clothing and food drives and provided supplies for a summer camp and holiday dinner for families in need. The Foundation was established in 2020 with the focus on helping to create equitable and inclusive opportunities and advancing environmental preservation. The Foundation is administered by our employees. In 2021, six organizations were chosen and received grants in aggregate totaling $1 million. In the DEI space, the following organizations received grants: Junior Achievement, The Trevor Project, and Bowie University. In the Sustainability space, the following organizations received grants: The Recycling Partnership, the Ocean Conservancy, Northeast Wilderness Trust, and The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.
