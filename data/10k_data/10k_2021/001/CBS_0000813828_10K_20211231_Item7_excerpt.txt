Overview

Operational Highlights 2021 vs. 2020 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Certain items identified as affecting comparability are excluded in non-GAAP results. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For 2021, revenues increased 13% to $28.59 billion from $25.29 billion in 2020, reflecting growth in all revenue streams. The increase was led by 64% higher streaming revenues, with growth across our streaming services, and an 11% increase in advertising revenues. The advertising revenue growth is principally the result of CBS’ broadcasts of Super Bowl LV and NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship (the “NCAA Tournament”) games, which contributed 9-percentage points of the increase and for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks, and the 2020 NCAA Tournament was cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). Affiliate revenues grew 5%, driven by expanded distribution for our domestic cable networks and growth in fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”). Licensing and other revenues also increased 5%, primarily reflecting a higher volume of licensing, including from the timing of program availabilities, partially offset by the benefit to the prior year from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to South Park. Theatrical revenues were up 34%, as a result of a higher number of theatrical releases in 2021, reflecting the impact on 2020 from the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19. 

Operating income for 2021 increased 52% to $6.30 billion from $4.14 billion in 2020. This comparison was impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including gains on sales in 2021 of $2.34 billion, principally reflecting gains on real estate sales of $2.23 billion; a gain on sale of $214 million in 2020; restructuring charges in each period; and in 2020, costs for other corporate matters, programming charges and impairment charges. Adjusted OIBDA decreased 13%, as revenue growth was more than offset by higher costs, principally from an increased investment in our streaming services, the timing of production as the prior year was impacted by shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, and the broadcast of noncomparable sporting events in 2021.

For 2021, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 90% and 79%, respectively, from 2020. These comparisons were impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including the aforementioned items impacting operating income, and in each period, a loss on extinguishment of debt, gains from investments, and discrete tax items. Adjusted net earnings 

II-4

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 12% and 17%, respectively, reflecting lower Adjusted OIBDA partially offset by the impact in the prior year from the noncontrolling interest’s share of profit from the licensing of South Park. Additionally, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS for 2021 were each impacted by the 2021 stock issuances discussed below, which negatively impacted reported diluted EPS by $.26 and adjusted diluted EPS by $.16.

Stock Offerings

On March 26, 2021, we completed offerings of 20 million shares of our Class B Common Stock at a price to the public of $85 per share and 10 million shares of 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $100 per share. The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $1.67 billion and $983 million, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. We have used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including investments in streaming.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

Results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results. 

Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) 2020 includes an impairment charge for FCC licenses of $25 million and accelerated depreciation of $12 million for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the merger of Viacom Inc. with and into CBS Corporation (the “Merger”).

(b) See notes on the following tables for additional information on items affecting comparability.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Reflects severance costs associated with changes in management at certain of our businesses and the impairment of lease assets in connection with cost transformation initiatives related to the Merger.

(b) Primarily reflects gains on the sales of CBS Studio Center, 51 West 52nd Street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of CBS (“51 West 52nd Street”), and a noncore trademark licensing operation.

(c) Primarily reflects a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of an investment that was sold during the third quarter of 2021.

(d) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans. 

(e) Primarily reflects a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits. 

(f) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of reported diluted EPS from continuing operations were 655 million and in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were 646 million. These amounts differ because adjusted diluted EPS excludes the effect of the assumed conversion of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock since the impact would have been antidilutive. As a result, in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding does not include the assumed issuance of shares upon conversion of preferred stock, and preferred stock dividends recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $44 million are deducted from net earnings from continuing operations.

(d) Primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19.

(e) Reflects a gain on the sale of CNET Media Group (“CMG”).

(f) Primarily reflects an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, Inc. (“fuboTV”), which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020. 

(g) Primarily reflects a benefit from the remeasurement of our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter of 2020. 

Consolidated Results of Operations - 2021 vs. 2020 

Revenues

Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, we changed the categories we use to disaggregate revenues to include streaming revenues in order to align with management’s increased focus on this revenue stream. Streaming revenues are comprised of streaming advertising and streaming subscription revenues. Streaming advertising revenues are earned from advertisements on our pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+ and Pluto TV, and from digital video advertisements on our websites and in our video content on third-party platforms (“other digital video platforms”). Streaming subscription revenues include fees for our pay streaming services, including Paramount+, Showtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (“Showtime OTT”), BET+ and Noggin, as well as premium subscriptions to access certain video content on our websites. Accordingly, our advertising and affiliate revenue categories exclude revenues earned by our streaming services and on other digital video platforms. The prior year has been reclassified to conform to this presentation. 

II-7

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.

(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.

Advertising

Advertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on our global broadcast and cable networks and television stations. For 2021, the 11% increase in advertising revenues was driven by the benefit in 2021 from CBS’ broadcasts of Super Bowl LV and NCAA Tournament games for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020, and an improved advertising market, driven by higher pricing and demand, compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2021. Additionally, while we share the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament with Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”) each year, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament in 2020. These noncomparable sporting events contributed 9-percentage points of the advertising revenue increase for 2021. The above-mentioned increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions for our domestic networks; lower political advertising sales, reflecting the benefit to 2020 from the U.S. Presidential election; and the absence of CMG as a result of its sale in the fourth quarter of 2020, which negatively impacted the comparison by 1-percentage point. 

In March 2021, we reached an agreement with the National Football League (“NFL”) to extend our rights to broadcast American Football Conference (AFC) regular season and post-season games, which include wildcard, divisional playoff and championship games, on the CBS Television Network and to stream these games live on Paramount+. The contract begins with the 2023 season and extends through the 2033 season, and includes the rights to the Super Bowl in 2024, 2028 and 2032, as well as certain expanded rights across our networks and platforms. The NFL has a one-time right to terminate the agreement after the 2029 season.

In 2022, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl and semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which will be carried by other networks, reflecting the above-mentioned rotational nature of the rights to broadcast these tentpole sporting events. However, comparability in 2022 will benefit from higher political advertising revenues, mainly in the second half of the year, driven by mid-term elections.

Affiliate 

Affiliate revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs” or “vMVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), reverse compensation, and fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and vMVPDs’ carriage of our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”). For 2021, affiliate revenues increased 5% as a result of growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues; and higher cable affiliate fees, reflecting the benefit from the launch of our basic cable networks in June 2020 and April 2021 on two vMVPDs, 

II-8

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

rate increases, and revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact of subscriber declines. 

Streaming 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2021, streaming advertising revenues grew 51% driven by higher advertising on our streaming services, Pluto TV and Paramount+, as well as growth on our other digital video platforms. Global monthly active users (“MAUs”), which reflect the number of unique devices interacting with the Pluto TV service in a calendar month, increased 21.3 million to 64.4 million for December 2021 from 43.1 million for December 2020. 

Streaming subscription revenues increased 79% reflecting subscriber growth, which was led by Paramount+, which benefited from film releases, including A Quiet Place Part II and PAW Patrol: The Movie; new original scripted dramas, including 1883 and Mayor of Kingstown; NFL games; and launches in international markets. Revenue growth also benefited from subscriber increases for Showtime OTT and BET+. Global streaming subscribers increased 26.2 million to 56.1 million at December 31, 2021 from 29.9 million at December 31, 2020. Global streaming subscribers include customers with access to our domestic or international streaming services, either directly through our owned and operated apps and websites, or through third-party distributors. Our subscribers include paid subscriptions and those customers registered in a free trial, and subscribers are considered unique to each of our services, whether offered individually or as part of a bundle.

Theatrical

Theatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For 2021, the 34% increase in theatrical revenues reflects the benefit from current year releases including A Quiet Place Part II and PAW Patrol: The Movie, while the prior year was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19, following the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.

Licensing and Other

Licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services, and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; fees from the distribution of third-party programming; and revenues from the rental of production facilities. For 2021, licensing and other revenues increased 5%, reflecting a higher volume of licensing, including from the timing of program availabilities as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 because of COVID-19, and increased licensing for consumer products. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to the prior year from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to South Park.

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

n/m - not meaningful

Production and Programming

Production and programming expenses reflect the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; and other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2021, the increase of 24% was primarily a result of an increased investment in content for our streaming services; the timing of production, as the prior year was impacted by shutdowns as a result of COVID-19; and higher sports programming costs, principally associated with noncomparable sporting events. 

Participations and Residuals

Participation and residual costs primarily include expenses relating to amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements. For 2021, participation and residual costs increased 17% primarily as a result of the increase in licensing revenues in 2021 as well as the mix of titles licensed in each year.

Programming Charges

During 2020, we recorded programming charges of $159 million primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19. 

Distribution and Other

Distribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs paid to third-party distributors; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations. For 2021, the 5% increase was a result of cost increases associated with the growth of our streaming services.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy, professional service fees and back office support, including employee compensation. The 20% increase in SG&A expenses was driven by advertising, marketing and other cost increases to support the growth 

II-10

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

and expansion of our streaming services, including the launch of Paramount+. The increase also reflects higher advertising and marketing costs to promote the increased level of original programming in 2021. 

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders and equipment under finance leases, amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, and impairment of fixed and intangible assets, when applicable. For 2020, amortization expense included an impairment charge of $25 million in the TV Entertainment segment to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their fair values and accelerated depreciation of $12 million resulting from the abandonment of technology in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger. 

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters 

During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded the following costs associated with restructuring and other corporate matters.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded restructuring charges of $100 million. These charges include $65 million of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, primarily associated with changes in management at certain of our businesses. The charges also include $35 million for the impairment of lease assets that we determined we will not use and began actively marketing for sublease. This determination was made in connection with cost-transformation initiatives related to the Merger. The impairment is the result of a decline in market conditions since inception of these leases and reflects the difference between the estimated fair values, which were determined based on the expected discounted future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying values. 

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $542 million, associated with cost-transformation initiatives in connection with the Merger in an effort to reduce redundancies across our businesses. These charges consisted of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, as well as costs resulting from the termination of contractual obligations and charges associated with the exit of leases. In addition, in 2020 we incurred costs of $56 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of professional fees mainly associated with integration activities, as well as transaction-related bonuses. We also incurred costs of $5 million for professional fees associated with dispositions and other corporate matters, and we recorded a charge of $15 million to write down property and equipment, which was classified as held for sale in 2020, to its fair value less costs to sell. 

II-11

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Net Gain on Sales 

During 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $760 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $523 million. 

Also in 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $1.85 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $1.70 billion.

In addition, during 2021 we recognized a pre-tax net gain of $117 million, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.

In 2020, we completed the sale of CMG to Red Ventures for $484 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $214 million. 

Interest Expense and Interest Income

The following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net Gains from Investments

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2021, net gains from investments primarily include a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of a marketable security that was sold during the third quarter of 2021. For 2020, net gains from investments primarily reflect an increase of $213 million in the fair value of our investment in fuboTV, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Loss on Extinguishment of Debt

For 2021 and 2020, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of $128 million and $126 million, respectively, associated with the early redemption of long-term debt of $1.99 billion for 2021 and $2.77 billion for 2020.

The following table presents the components of Other items, net.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2021, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $646 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 12.4%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a discrete tax benefit of $517 million, which includes a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment during the second quarter of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits. The discrete tax benefit of $517 million, together with a net tax provision of $546 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures, which principally include net gains on sales, reduced our effective income tax rate by 7.8 percentage points.

For 2020, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $535 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 17.0%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a discrete tax benefit of $110 million, primarily consisting of a benefit of $100 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter of 2020, as well as a tax benefit of $13 million realized in connection with the preparation of the 2019 tax returns. These items, together with a net tax benefit of $129 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures, including restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and net gains from investments, reduced our effective income tax rate by 4.1 percentage points.

Equity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax

The following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2021 and 2020, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax includes impairment charges of $34 million and $9 million, respectively, relating to television joint ventures.

Net Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2020, net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily reflects our joint venture partners’ share of profit from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to South Park to a streaming service.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2021, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 90% and 79%, respectively, primarily driven by the above-mentioned gains on sales of $1.75 billion, net of tax, and higher discrete tax benefits in 2021. The diluted EPS comparison also includes the effect of higher weighted average shares outstanding as a result of stock issuances in the first quarter of 2021, which negatively impacted EPS for 2021 by $.26.

Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, to Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin Random House”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (see Legal Matters). Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Segments

In 2021, we operated through the following three segments:

TV ENTERTAINMENT: TV Entertainment consisted of the CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast network; CBS Studios and CBS Media Ventures, the segment’s television production and syndication operations; CBS Sports Network, CBS Sports’ 24-hour cable channel; CBS Stations, our owned broadcast television stations; and a number of streaming services, including our direct-to-consumer streaming service, Paramount+ (in the United States) and several CBS-branded streaming services, including CBS News Streaming and CBS Sports HQ. TV Entertainment’s revenues were generated primarily from advertising; affiliate revenues, comprised of reverse compensation and retransmission fees; streaming revenues, principally comprised of advertising and subscription revenues generated by the segment’s streaming services and from digital video advertisements on our websites and in our video content on third-party platforms; and the licensing and distribution of content.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

During the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the Publishing segment. Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. 

Beginning in 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in a change to our operating segments. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will report results based on the following segments:

TV MEDIA: TV Media consists of our historical TV Entertainment and Cable Networks segments, except that it no longer includes their corresponding direct-to-consumer streaming services (now part of our Direct-to-Consumer segment) and Nickelodeon Studio (now part of our Filmed Entertainment segment), and now includes Paramount Television Studios (formerly part of our historical Filmed Entertainment segment).

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER: Direct-to-Consumer consists of our portfolio of free, premium and pay streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, Showtime OTT, BET+ and Noggin.

FILMED ENTERTAINMENT: Filmed Entertainment consists of our historical Filmed Entertainment segment, except that it no longer includes Paramount Television Studios (now part of our TV Media segment), and now includes Nickelodeon Studio (formerly part of our historical Cable Networks segment).

We present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and net gain on sales, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. The reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to our consolidated net earnings is presented in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.

(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.

(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.

Revenues

For 2021, revenues increased 21%, reflecting growth across all revenue streams, led by increased advertising revenues, including from CBS’ broadcasts of tentpole sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts in 2020, higher licensing revenues and growth at Paramount+. 

Advertising

The 16% increase in advertising revenues was driven by CBS’ broadcasts in 2021 of sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts in the prior year, including Super Bowl LV and NCAA Tournament games.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2021. Additionally, while we share the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament with Turner each year, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament in 2020. The increase also reflects an improved advertising market, driven by higher pricing and demand, compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19, and a higher level of original programming broadcast in 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower ratings for the CBS Television Network, lower political advertising and a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact from the absence of advertising revenues from CMG, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2020.

In 2022, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl and semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which will be carried by other networks, reflecting the above-mentioned rotational nature of the rights to broadcast tentpole sporting events. However, comparability in 2022 will benefit from higher political advertising revenues, mainly in the second half of the year, driven by mid-term elections. 

Affiliate 

Affiliate revenues increased 7%, as a result of growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues.

Streaming 

Streaming revenues increased 70%, primarily reflecting subscriber growth at Paramount+, as well as advertising growth from Paramount+ and other digital video platforms.

Licensing and Other

Licensing and other revenues increased 26%, driven by the timing of program availabilities, primarily from the impact of production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19, and a higher volume of domestic licensing, including the benefit from current year licensing arrangements for NCIS, Bull and several library titles. The increase also reflects higher licensing to Cable Networks, driven by licensing to Pluto TV and to Paramount+ internationally. The increase was partially offset by the absence of ancillary revenues from CMG. 

Adjusted OIBDA

Adjusted OIBDA decreased 42% primarily reflecting our increased investment in Paramount+, including higher content and marketing costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.

(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.

Revenues

For 2021, revenues increased 13%, reflecting growth across all revenue streams, led by higher streaming revenues. 

Advertising

The 5% increase in advertising revenues was driven by higher international advertising, reflecting an improved advertising market, which benefited from the comparison against the impact in 2020 from COVID-19, the acquisition in 2021 of Chilevisión, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Taken together, the acquisition and foreign exchange rate changes contributed 2-percentage points of the growth in total advertising revenue. Domestic advertising also benefited from an improved advertising market, reflecting higher pricing and demand, but declined compared with the prior year as a result of lower linear impressions for our cable networks.

Affiliate 

The 3% growth in affiliate revenues was primarily driven by the benefit from the launch of our basic cable networks in June 2020 and April 2021 on two vMVPDs, increases in rates, and revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact from subscriber declines. 

Streaming

The 60% increase in streaming revenues was driven by advertising revenue growth from our free streaming service, Pluto TV, and other digital video platforms, as well as growth in subscribers for our subscription streaming services. Subscriber growth was driven by Showtime OTT, BET+ and our international streaming services, including the benefit from the launch of Paramount+ in several international markets.

Licensing and Other

The 14% increase in licensing and other revenues was driven by higher revenues from the licensing of programming to streaming services, primarily Paramount+, and for consumer products, partially offset by the domestic licensing of South Park in the prior year.

Adjusted OIBDA

Adjusted OIBDA remained substantially flat as growth from advertising, affiliate, and streaming revenues was offset by higher content and marketing costs and lower profits from content licensing, reflecting the mix of titles licensed in each year.

Filmed Entertainment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

For 2021, revenues increased 20% reflecting growth in licensing revenues and theatrical revenues.

Theatrical

The 34% increase in theatrical revenues reflects the benefit from current year releases including A Quiet Place Part II and PAW Patrol: The Movie while the prior year was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19, following the release of Sonic the Hedgehog in the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.

Licensing and Other

The 19% increase in licensing and other revenues was driven by the licensing of current year releases, including Coming 2 America, Tom Clancy’s Without Remorse and Halloween Kills to third parties, and Infinite, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run and Rumble to Paramount+, while licensing in the prior year was impacted by the above-mentioned impact from COVID-19.

Adjusted OIBDA

Adjusted OIBDA increased 71%, primarily the result of higher profits associated with the licensing of films. 

Fluctuations in results for the Filmed Entertainment segment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash 

We project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes, and pension funding obligations. Our

investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility described below, as well as access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. 

Our funding for short-term and long-term obligations, including our long-term debt obligations (see Note 10), as well as our long term operating commitments, including for programming and talent (see Note 20) and lease obligations (see Note 11), will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from non-core asset sales, including the planned sale of Simon & Schuster described below, as well as our ability to refinance our debt. We also increased our liquidity position with the proceeds from our first quarter 2021 stock offerings described below, and the fourth quarter sales of 51 West 52nd Street for $760 million, and CBS Studio Center for $1.85 billion. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to lower our interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

During 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster for $2.175 billion in cash, and expect to use proceeds from the sale to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including in streaming, as well as to fund dividends and pay down debt. On November 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block the sale. The purchase agreement contains commitments on the part of the purchaser to take all necessary steps to obtain any required regulatory approvals and to defend any litigation that would delay or prevent consummation, and also provides for a termination fee payable to us in certain circumstances in the event the transaction does not close for regulatory reasons (see Legal Matters).

On March 26, 2021, we completed offerings of 20 million shares of our Class B Common Stock at a price to the public of $85 per share and 10 million shares of 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $100 per share. The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $1.67 billion and $983 million, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. We have used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including investments in streaming.

If declared, dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly through April 1, 2024. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock accumulate from the most recent dividend payment date, and will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of 5.75% of the liquidation preference of $100 per share, payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock or through any combination of cash and shares of Class B Common Stock, at our election. 

Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. The cost of any new borrowings are affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

At December 31, 2021, we had $2.36 billion of remaining availability under our share repurchase program. Any share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt. 

Cash Flows

The changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities. The decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was mainly driven by increased investment in our streaming services, including spending for content, advertising and marketing, and a higher level of production in 2021 as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19. The decrease was partially offset by higher collections and lower payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies, as well as lower payments for income taxes. Payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies included in cash flow provided by operating activities were $294 million and $584 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Cash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $291 million for 2021 from $411 million for 2020 primarily due to a higher volume of production incentives received, lower adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a higher deduction associated with the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher tax payments associated with gains from dispositions, primarily from the sale of CBS Studio Center in 2021. 

Cash flow provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of Simon & Schuster.

(d) 2021 primarily reflects proceeds received from the sales of CBS Studio Center and 51 West 52nd Street. 2021 also includes proceeds received from the sale of our investment in fuboTV during the fourth quarter of 2020, and proceeds received from the sales of a noncore trademark licensing operation and other investments. 2020 reflects the sales of CMG and marketable securities. 

Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Dividends

We declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the quarters of 2021 and 2020. During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $.96, resulting in total annual dividends of $625 million and $601 million, respectively. On December 19, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, resulting in total dividends of $150 million. Prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS each declared a quarterly cash dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2019. During the first three quarters of 2019, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.54, resulting in total dividends of $205 million. During the first three quarters of 2019, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $.60, resulting in total dividends of $245 million.

During each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.4375 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $1.5493 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021. Accordingly, we recorded dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $44.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. 

On February 10, 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2022. At the same time, we also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.4375 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, payable on April 1, 2022. 

Capital Structure

The following table sets forth our debt.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $466 million and $491 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $95 million and $107 million, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $18.27 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.33 billion at December 31, 2020.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $1.99 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.11 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $128 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $4.50 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds from these issuances for the redemption of long-term debt totaling $2.77 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.88 billion, as well as for general corporate purposes. The early redemption resulted in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $126 million.

Our 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.895% and 3.899%, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period. In January 2022, we delivered notice that we will be calling our 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 in full on February 28, 2022.

The subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

II-24

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

The interest rate payable on our 3.45% senior notes due October 2026, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to these senior notes. The interest rate on these senior notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes was $124 million.

Some of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.

Commercial Paper

At both December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings. 

Credit Facility 

At December 31, 2021, we had a $3.50 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Credit Facility was amended to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen with EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR-based rates, respectively, as publication of all non-USD LIBOR tenors has been discontinued after December 31, 2021. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2021. On February 14, 2022, we further amended our Credit Facility to modify the definition of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio in the amended credit agreement to allow unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness through June 2024. 

At December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $3.50 billion.

Other Bank Borrowings

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had bank borrowings under Miramax’s $300 million credit facility, which matures in April 2023, of $35 million and $95 million, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.50%.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, 

II-25

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

We consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales and content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.

Advertising Revenues—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.

Affiliate Revenues—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and vMVPDs, also includes a license to programming for video on demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to our customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.

II-26

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Content Licensing Revenues—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. 

Film and Television Production and Programming Costs

Costs incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. The costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. Acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.

For internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs. 

For television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs. 

For feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. 

For acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

For programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, which includes our acquired programming rights and certain internally-produced television programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. Such estimates require management’s judgement and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. These estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program. 

For content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the content within the film group is less than its amortized costs. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that have been substantively abandoned are written off. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test 

We perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, on an annual basis and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. 

FCC Licenses—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2021, we had 14 television markets with FCC license book values. 

For our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for 11 of our television markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary. 

We performed a quantitative impairment test for the FCC licenses in the remaining three markets. The impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in two of the markets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20% and the fair value of the FCC license in one of the markets exceeded its carrying value of $157 million by 9%. 

The quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding

discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.

The estimated fair values of FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2021, we had four reporting units. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we tested two reporting units as of August 31 and two reporting units as of October 31. During the fourth quarter of 2021, to better align the timing of our annual impairment date with our budgeting cycle, we changed the date for the annual impairment test to October 31 for all reporting units. As a result, those two reporting units previously tested as of August 31 were also tested as of October 31 based on a qualitative assessment resulting in no changes to the conclusion below. 

For our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that we estimate has an aggregate fair value that significantly exceed its respective carrying values. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for two of our reporting units. For each of these two reporting units, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. We also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units and that the lower tax rate from a tax law change enacted since the most recent quantitative tests would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of these two reporting units is higher than their respective carrying amounts and therefore performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary. 

For the 2021 annual impairment test, we elected to perform quantitative impairment tests for two reporting units: CBS Television and CBS Interactive, because of the amount of time that has elapsed since the previous quantitative tests. The quantitative goodwill impairment test evaluates whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. For CBS Television, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values

of comparable businesses (“Guideline Public Company Method”). The Discounted Cash Flow Method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. The terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. For 2021, we utilized a discount rate of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 1.5%. The Guideline Public Company Method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. The selected multiples consider each reporting unit’s relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. For CBS Interactive, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the Guideline Public Company Method. Based on the results of the 2021 quantitative impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair value of each of the two reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required. 

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Legal Matters

Estimates of liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2021, changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in a slight decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the prior year-end due to an increase in 

II-30

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

the discount rate, which was mostly offset by the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $136 million and would have an insignificant impact on 2022 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $8 million to 2022 pension expense.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $301 million at December 31, 2021 is properly recorded.

Legal Matters

General

On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Litigation Relating to the Merger

Beginning on February 20, 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On March 31, 2020, the Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating

Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. On April 14, 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 13, 2019, as amended on October 16, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On June 5, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On January 27, 2021, the Court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. 

Beginning on November 25, 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On January 23, 2020, the Court consolidated the four lawsuits. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. On February 28, 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On May 22, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On December 29, 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. 

Investigation-Related Matters

As announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas or requests for information from the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the

Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to court approval. All amounts payable by the Company under the settlement will be paid by the Company’s insurers.

Litigation Related to Television Station Owners

On September 9, 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning on or about January 1, 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. On October 8, 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the court on November 6, 2020. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to court approval. 

Litigation Related to Stock Offerings

On August 13, 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and on November 5, 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. On December 22, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which are pending. The Complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, as well as other relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.

Litigation Related to the Proposed Sale of Simon & Schuster

On November 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to block our sale of the Simon & Schuster business to Penguin Random House (the

“Transaction”) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), dated November 24, 2020, between the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. The DOJ asserts that the sale of Simon & Schuster would reduce competition for the acquisition of titles. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including commitments on the part of Penguin Random House to take all necessary steps to obtain any required regulatory approvals and to defend any litigation that would delay or prevent consummation, and also provides for a termination fee payable to the Company in certain circumstances in the event the Transaction does not close for regulatory reasons. We and the other defendants believe the DOJ’s claims are without merit, and we intend to defend against them vigorously.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos

We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2021, we had pending approximately 27,770 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 30,710 as of December 31, 2020 and 30,950 as of December 31, 2019. During 2021, we received approximately 3,050 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 5,990 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2021 and 2020 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $63 million and $35 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are sufficient to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Other

From time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.

Market Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $1.94 billion and $1.27 billion, respectively. For 2021, $1.38 billion related to future production costs and $564 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2020, $740 million related to future production costs and $529 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. 

Interest Risk

Interest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify this exposure at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2021 or 2020 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates. 

At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $17.66 billion and the estimated fair value was $21.5 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.62 billion and $2.64 billion, respectively.

Credit Risk

We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

II-35
