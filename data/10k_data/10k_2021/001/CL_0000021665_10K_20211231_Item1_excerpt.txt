(a) General Development of the Business

Colgate-Palmolive Company (together with its subsidiaries, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or “Colgate”) is a caring, innovative growth company reimagining a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet. We seek to deliver sustainable, profitable growth and superior shareholder returns, as well as provide Colgate people with an innovative and inclusive work environment. We do this by developing and selling products globally that make people’s and their pets’ lives healthier and more enjoyable and by embracing our sustainability and social impact and diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) strategies across our organization. Our products are marketed in over 200 countries and territories throughout the world. Colgate was founded in 1806 and incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1923.

For recent business developments and other information, refer to the information set forth under the captions “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Executive Overview,” “– Outlook,” “–Results of Operations” and “– Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Part II, Item 7 of this report.

(c) Narrative Description of the Business

We operate in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition. We are a leader in Oral Care with global leadership in the toothpaste and manual toothbrush categories according to market share data. We sell our toothpastes under brands such as Colgate, Darlie, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso and Tom’s of Maine, our toothbrushes under brands such as Colgate, Darlie, elmex and meridol and our mouthwashes under brands such as Colgate, elmex and meridol. Our Oral Care business also includes pharmaceutical products for dentists and other oral health professionals.

We are a leader in many product categories of the Personal Care market with global leadership in liquid hand soap, according to market share data, which we sell under brands such as Palmolive, Protex and Softsoap. Our Personal Care products also include Irish Spring, Palmolive and Protex bar soaps, Irish Spring, Palmolive, Sanex and Softsoap shower gels, Lady Speed Stick, Sanex, Speed Stick and Tom’s of Maine deodorants and antiperspirants, EltaMD, Filorga and PCA SKIN skin health products and Palmolive shampoos and conditioners. 

We manufacture and market a wide array of products for the Home Care market, including Ajax, Axion and Palmolive dishwashing liquids and Ajax, Fabuloso and Murphy household cleaners. We are a market leader in fabric conditioners with leading brands, including Suavitel in Latin America, Soupline in Europe, and Cuddly in the South Pacific, according to market share data.

Sales of Oral, Personal and Home Care products accounted for 44%, 20% and 17%, respectively, of our total worldwide Net sales in 2021. Geographically, Oral Care is a significant part of our business in Asia Pacific, comprising approximately 81% of Net sales in that region for 2021.

Through our Hill’s Pet Nutrition segment (“Hill’s” or “Pet Nutrition”), we are a world leader in specialty pet nutrition products for dogs and cats with products marketed in over 80 countries and territories worldwide. Hill’s markets pet foods primarily under two brands. Hill’s Science Diet, which is called Hill’s Science Plan in Europe, is a range of products for everyday nutritional needs. Hill’s Prescription Diet is a range of therapeutic products to help nutritionally manage disease conditions in dogs and cats.

Distribution; Raw Materials; Competition; Trademarks and Patents

Our Oral, Personal and Home Care products are sold to a variety of traditional and eCommerce retailers, wholesalers and distributors worldwide. Pet Nutrition products are sold by authorized pet supply retailers, veterinarians and eCommerce retailers. Certain of our products are also sold direct-to-consumer. Our sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12% of our Net sales in 2021. No other customer represents more than 10% of our Net sales. We support our products with advertising, promotion and other marketing (with increasing emphasis on digital) to build awareness and trial of our products. Our products are marketed by a direct sales force at individual operating subsidiaries or business units and by distributors or brokers.

The majority of raw and packaging materials used in our products are purchased from other companies and is available from several sources. No single raw or packaging material represents, and no single supplier provides, a significant portion of our total material requirements. We do, however, purchase certain key raw and packaging materials from single-source suppliers or a limited number of suppliers. For certain materials, however, new suppliers may have to be qualified under industry, governmental and/or Colgate standards, which can require additional investment and take a significant period of time. Raw and packaging material commodities, such as essential oils, resins, tropical oils, pulp, tallow, corn, poultry and soybeans, are subject to market price variations. For further information regarding the impact of changes in commodity prices, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors - Volatility in material and other costs could adversely impact our profitability” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 

Our products are sold in a highly competitive global marketplace which has experienced increased retail trade concentration, the rapid growth of eCommerce, the integration of traditional and digital operations at key retailers and the growing presence of large-format retailers, discounters and eCommerce retailers. Products similar to those that we produce and sell are available from multinational and local competitors in the U.S. and overseas. Certain of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we do. In addition, the substantial growth in eCommerce has encouraged the entry of new competitors and business models. In certain geographies, we also face strong local competitors, who may be more agile and have better local consumer insights than we do. Private label brands sold by retailers are also a source of competition for certain of our products. 

The retail landscape in many of our markets continues to evolve as a result of the rapid growth of eCommerce retailers, changing consumer preferences (as consumers increasingly shop online and via mobile and social applications) and the increased presence of alternative retail channels, such as subscription services and direct-to-consumer businesses. These trends have accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced disruptions in certain channels, including travel retail. We also continue to see changes in the purchasing patterns of our consumers, including the nature and/or frequency of visits by consumers to retailers and dental, veterinary and skin health professionals as well as a shift, in many markets, to purchasing our products online. We face competition in several aspects of our business, including pricing, promotional activities, new product and brand introductions and expansion into new geographies and channels. Product quality, innovation, brand recognition, marketing capability and acceptance of new products and brands largely determine success in Colgate’s operating segments.

We consider trademarks to be of material importance to our business. We follow a practice of seeking trademark protection in the U.S. and throughout the world where our products are sold. Principal global and regional trademarks include Colgate, Palmolive, elmex, hello, meridol, Sorriso, Tom’s of Maine, EltaMD, Filorga, Irish Spring, Lady Speed Stick, PCA SKIN, Protex, Sanex, Softsoap, Speed Stick, Ajax, Axion, Fabuloso, Murphy, Soupline and Suavitel, as well as Hill’s Science Diet and Hill’s Prescription Diet. Our rights in these trademarks endure for as long as they are used and/or registered. Although we actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, no single patent is considered significant to the business as a whole.

COVID-19

COVID-19 and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have had and continue to have a profound impact on the way people live, work, interact and shop and have significantly impacted and may continue to impact economic activity around the world.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the communities in which we manufacture, market and sell our products experienced and in some cases continue to experience “stay at home” orders, travel or movement restrictions and other government actions to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19, and have implemented varying policies to address the pandemic, resume economic activity and vaccinate their populations. Because the vast majority of our products (such as oral care products, soaps and other personal hygiene products, home cleaners and pet food) have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, we have, in most instances, been able to continue operating our business, although not always at full capacity. In doing so, the health, safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been and remains our first priority. In addition, some of our suppliers, customers, distributors, logistics providers and service providers have experienced disruptions to their businesses.

We saw a significant increase in demand across many of our categories, such as liquid hand soap, dish liquid, bar soap and cleaners, during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by consumer pantry-loading and increased consumption of our products. While consumer demand for most of these categories declined year-over-year in 2021, most remained above historical levels, and we believe that some of this increase in consumption is sustainable in light of changes in consumer behavior related to COVID-19. Across our business, changes in consumer demand for our products vary by product category and geography depending on, among other things, the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, the availability of our products at retailers and supply chain disruptions.

The COVID-19 pandemic and government steps to reduce the spread and address the impact of COVID-19 have impacted and may continue to impact our consumers’ ability to purchase and our ability to manufacture and distribute our products. While we believe that, in the long-term, consumer demand for the products in our categories will continue to be strong, uncertainties continue surrounding the timing and duration of the pandemic and the recovery from it. COVID-19 has also disrupted our retail customers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers and other third parties; their ability to address COVID-19 and maintain their operations at full capacity has impacted and may continue to impact sales of and consumer access to our products. In particular, COVID-19 has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, the travel retail channel. We expect the ongoing economic impact, health concerns associated with COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions to continue to impact consumer behavior, shopping patterns and consumption preferences during 2022. 

For additional information regarding COVID-19’s impact on our business, see Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Executive Overview.”

Government Regulations

As a global company, we are subject to extensive governmental regulations, including environmental rules and regulations, in the U.S. and abroad. The most significant government regulations that impact our business are discussed below. It is our policy and practice to comply with all government regulations applicable to our business. In 2021, compliance with these regulations did not have, and we do not expect such compliance in the future to have, a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. For further discussion of how global legal and regulatory requirements may impact our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” 

Product Development: Legal and regulatory requirements apply to most aspects of our products, including their development, ingredients, formulation, manufacture, packaging content, labeling, storage, transportation, distribution, export, import, advertising, sale and environmental impact. U.S. federal authorities, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Occupational, Health and Safety Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency, regulate different aspects of our business, along with parallel authorities at the state and local levels and comparable authorities overseas.

3

Anti-Corruption, Anti-Bribery, Commercial Bribery and Competition: We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws that generally prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to gain an unfair business advantage, and laws that prohibit commercial bribery. In addition, our selling practices are regulated by competition law authorities in the U.S. and abroad.

Privacy and Data Protection: Our collection, storage, transfer and/or processing of customer, consumer, employee, vendor and other stakeholder information and personal data is subject to privacy, data use and data security regulations in the U.S. and abroad, including the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.

Trade Compliance: We are subject to laws and sanctions imposed by the U.S., including, without limitation, those imposed by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (“OFAC”), and/or by other jurisdictions that may prohibit us or certain of our affiliates from doing business in certain countries or restrict the kind of business that may be conducted.

Human Capital Management

Human capital matters at Colgate are managed by our Global Human Resources function, led by our Chief Human Resources Officer, with oversight from the Personnel and Organization Committee of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 33,800 employees based in over 100 countries. Approximately 70% of our revenues are generated from markets outside the U.S. and 86% of our employees are located outside the U.S. Approximately 36% of our employees are based in Asia Pacific, 30% are based in Latin America, 15% are based in Europe, 14% are based in North America and 5% are based in Africa/Eurasia. Our global workforce covers a broad range of functions, from manufacturing employees to management personnel and certain of our employees are represented by unions or works councils.

Colgate’s Culture and Core Values

As we work to achieve Colgate’s purpose to reimagine a healthier future for all people, their pets and our planet, Colgate people, working around the world, share a commitment to our three core corporate values: Caring, Global Teamwork and Continuous Improvement. These values are reflected not only in the quality of our products and reputation, but also in our dedication to serving the communities where we live and work, as reflected in our sustainability and social impact and DE&I strategies. With these values, we work to maintain a strong culture based on integrity, ethical behavior and a commitment to doing the right thing. Underlying these values and our strong culture is the commitment of all Colgate people to maintain the highest ethical standards and demonstrate ethical leadership, including compliance with Colgate policies and our Code of Ethics.

CARING: We care about people — Colgate people, consumers, customers, stockholders, business partners and people in the communities where we live and work. We are committed to acting with compassion, integrity, honesty and high ethics in all situations and to providing our employees with an innovative and inclusive work environment. As a reflection of Colgate’s caring value, during the COVID-19 pandemic, protecting the health, safety and well-being of Colgate people and their families has been and remains our first priority. While we have reopened most of our offices, in some instances on a limited and voluntary basis, many of our office-based employees globally continue to work from home. We have implemented additional health and safety measures consistent with government recommendations and/or requirements to help ensure employee safety in our offices, production facilities, warehouses and technology centers. These measures may include: health and temperature screening, social distancing and personal protective equipment protocols, hand washing, contact tracing, enhanced cleaning procedures, respiratory hygiene, education and, in some instances, testing and/or vaccination requirements. We also leveraged our available technologies to maximize our connectivity and productivity and drew upon new capabilities gained through our focus on digital transformation to help to keep our people connected during the COVID-19 pandemic. We have also offered Colgate people and their families enhanced mental health and wellness benefit offerings, including counseling, paid leave to care for family members and flexible schedules to adapt to changing circumstances, and have provided ongoing health and safety education, including bringing in experts on infectious diseases and COVID-19 vaccines. Combined with the fact that the vast majority of our products have been deemed essential for the health and well-being of people and their pets, these efforts have, in most instances, enabled us to continue to operate during the pandemic providing consumers with the health and hygiene products they need and want.

GLOBAL TEAMWORK: All Colgate people are part of a global team, committed to working and collaborating together across functions and countries. Only by sharing ideas, technologies and talents can we achieve and sustain profitable growth.

CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT: We are committed to getting better every day in all that we do, as individuals and as teams. We continue to drive a continuous learning culture and transform our learning strategy to better meet the evolving expectations of our people. We provide our employees with learning experiences focused on building leadership skills and offer training programs that are closely aligned with our business strategy. Specifically, we are implementing new ways of working and instilling a growth mindset to drive innovation with focus, empowerment, experimentation and digitization. For example, in 2021, we implemented required training for all salaried and clerical employees to support our focus on digital with courses that demonstrate the importance of digital and what it means to have a digital culture. We are also committed to listening to our employees and seeing how the company is evolving and growing through regular employee engagement surveys.

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 

We believe our people are crucial to our ongoing business success and aim to recruit, develop and retain strong and diverse talent. We celebrate differences, promote an equitable and inclusive environment and value the contributions of all Colgate people. At Colgate, we are proud of our collaborative spirit – what we call The Power of WE. As a truly global company, we are working to ensure that our workforce reflects the diversity of the communities in which we live and work. As of December 31, 2021, our global workforce was approximately 60% male and 40% female. Women represented approximately 53% of our salaried and clerical employees, 40% of Colgate’s executives and 33% of senior leadership. Measuring the race/ethnicity of our workforce is challenging to do on a global basis. In the U.S., on an employee self-reported basis, the racial/ethnic composition of our workforce was approximately 67% White, 9% Asian, 9% Black, 9% Hispanic, 4% unidentified and 2% Other. The racial/ethnic composition of our executives was approximately 60% White, 17% Hispanic, 14% Asian, 7% Black, 1% unidentified and 1% Other and the composition of senior leadership was approximately 63% White, 18% Hispanic, 10% Black and 9% Asian. “Other” refers to American Indian/Alaska Native, two or more races or Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander. In this section, “executives” refers to those employees who are eligible to participate in Colgate’s equity incentive compensation plans and “senior leadership” refers to employees who are Vice Presidents and above.

We are committed to providing all of our employees with an equitable and inclusive work environment, learning opportunities and promotion and growth opportunities. A vital piece of our DE&I strategy has been ensuring that our succession planning process incorporates the advancement of women and people of all cultures, including underrepresented communities. To help further foster inclusiveness, we support employee resource groups for team members of many different underrepresented communities. Each of these resource groups contributes to our inclusive work environment by developing and implementing programs to promote business and community involvement as well as cultural awareness. We also partner with external organizations to develop an inclusive and supportive work environment.

Our global DE&I strategy aims to further advance our commitment to become an even more diverse, equitable and inclusive organization. The four pillars of our strategy are People, Community, Supplier Diversity and Communication. Consistent with this strategy, we are working to implement policies, learning experiences and processes that promote awareness, empathy, advocacy and opportunity; become an ally for positive change for the underserved in communities in which we live and work; support minority and women-owned suppliers to enable success of diversity-owned businesses; and promote dialogue around DE&I to increase awareness and advance the culture change to achieve our vision. In 2021, we released our first DE&I Report, which is available on the Colgate website. In addition, we instituted mandatory allyship and unconscious bias training for all salaried and clerical employees at Colgate to help our employees better understand DE&I concepts and embed allyship as a daily practice. Our Board, through its Personnel and Organization Committee, receives regular updates from management on our DE&I efforts.

Succession Planning

We have a rigorous succession planning process, led by our Global Human Resources function. Our Board is also extensively involved in succession planning and people development with special focus on CEO succession. As part of the succession planning process, we review and discuss potential successors to key positions and examine backgrounds, capabilities and appropriate developmental assignments.

Compensation Philosophy

Given the importance of Colgate people to our business success, motivating and retaining critical talent is a key focus. We view compensation as an important tool to motivate leaders at all levels of the organization. For information regarding our compensation philosophy and executive compensation programs, please see our Proxy Statement to be filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in connection with the 2022 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

Sustainability

We view sustainability as being critically important to our overall business and growth strategy. In November 2020, we announced our 2025 Sustainability & Social Impact Strategy, focusing on three key ambitions — preserving our environment by accelerating action on climate change and reducing our environmental footprint; helping millions of homes by empowering people to develop healthier habits; and driving social impact with a commitment to helping to ensure the well-being of all people and their pets. These ambitions are supported by actionable targets consistent with our continued commitment to building environmental and social consciousness into our decision-making. 

In 2021, we made progress on the targets set forth in our 2025 Sustainability & Social Impact Strategy.

Reduce Plastic Waste: As a positive step toward achieving our targets to reduce the use of new plastic by a third and make our packaging 100% recyclable, reusable or compostable by 2025, we are working to implement our first-of-its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube across our toothpaste portfolio. We also launched Colgate Keep, our first-of-its-kind manual toothbrush with a replaceable head and a reusable aluminum handle for 80% less plastic waste compared to similarly sized Colgate toothbrushes.

Accelerate Action on Climate Change and Conserve Water: To support our goal to become net zero carbon in our operations by 2040, we have built renewable energy roadmaps at each of our operational sites across the world and have engaged all of our Tier 1 Suppliers in support of our goal to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 30% (versus 2018). With our Save Water campaign, we estimate that our consumers have contributed to an avoidance of approximately 206 billion gallons of water and 10.8 million metric tons of CO2 emissions, since its launch in 2016.

Ingredient Transparency: We continue to promote ingredient transparency and seek to follow the highest safety and efficacy standards as we formulate our products. We have rolled out a new “Fragrance & Flavors Share for Good” ingredient transparency program, which provides additional ingredient information.

Social Impact: Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures is our flagship oral health education and well-being initiative. Since the program was established in 1991, we have reached over 1.4 billion children and their families in more than 80 countries.

During the fourth quarter of 2021, to help support and further our 2025 Sustainability & Social Impact Strategy, the Company issued €500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the “Sustainability Bond”). An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Sustainability Bond will be used to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to our Sustainable Financing Framework.

Additional information about our sustainability strategy and achievements can be found on the Sustainability section of our website.
