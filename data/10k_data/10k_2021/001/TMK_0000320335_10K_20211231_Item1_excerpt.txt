Annuities

Annuity products include single-premium and flexible-premium deferred annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, comprised less than 1% of premium. The Company does not currently market annuity products.

Pricing

Premium rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, investment income, expenses, and target profit margins. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings rates. Revenues for individual life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected by actual experience deviations from the established assumptions and to the extent investment income varies from that required for policy reserves.

Collections for annuity products and certain life products are not recognized as revenues, but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income in excess of the amounts required for policy reserves.

Underwriting

The underwriting standards of each Globe Life insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information obtained from the application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, including, but not limited to inspection reports, pharmacy data, motor vehicle records, responses to both medical and not medical questions, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage, or rejected.

Reserves

The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Globe Life's consolidated financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). These reserves, with future premiums and the associated interest compounded at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally, the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health insurance policies written by Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries, since these policies generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Globe Life's reserves are reported in Note 1—Significant Accounting Policies. Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit payments.

Reinsurance

Globe Life has historically participated in very limited third-party reinsurance as a result of the low face amounts of the policies sold by the Company. See Schedule IV and Note 6—Commitments and Contingencies for more information.

Investments

The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Globe Life insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Approximately 94% of our invested assets, at fair value, are fixed maturities at December 31, 2021 (see Note 4—Investments and Management’s Discussion and Analysis).

Competition

Globe Life competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance companies competing with Globe Life, no individual company dominates any of Globe Life's life or health insurance markets.

Globe Life's health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.

The Company effectively competes with other carriers, in part, due to its ability to operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows Globe Life to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.

Regulation

Insurance—Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. Insurance companies are also required to file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the 

5

 GL 2021 FORM 10-K
National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.

Risk-Based Capital (RBC)—The NAIC requires that a risk-based capital formula be applied to all life and health insurers. The risk-based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank companies that are adequately capitalized. All Globe Life's insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk-based capital formula. See further discussion of RBC in Capital Resources.

Holding Company—States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to constitute a holding company system. Globe Life and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York.

Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)

Globe Life’s sustainable business practices are a driver of the success and longevity that our Company has experienced since its origin. We plan to advance our sustainable business practices by further developing the Company's ESG strategy and disclosures and intend to align with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations. 

Environmental responsibility and sustainability are key components of our overall corporate responsibility efforts. We strive to reduce our impact on the environment by implementing numerous green building initiatives at our corporate facilities, placing a company-wide emphasis on recycling and reducing waste generally, and focusing on efforts to reduce the use of paper and water. With respect to social matters, our focus continues to be on supporting a culture that is inclusive and attractive for all of our employees and independent sales agents. We are committed to maintaining a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which we work. In addition, to enable the Company to appropriately respond to ESG-related challenges and opportunities, the Company has in place an ESG Committee, and the Board and its committees regularly engage with senior management on relevant ESG-related issues. 

Human Capital Management

Globe Life's talent base encompasses a broad range of experience that possesses the depth of critical skills to efficiently and effectively accomplish our business purpose and mission, serve our policyholders, and protect our shareholders' interests. Maintaining superior human capital is a key driver to the success and longevity that our Company has experienced since its origins dating back to the early 1900s. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 3,222 full time, part-time, and temporary employees. In 2021, our employee headcount decreased by 1% due to normal attrition. The Company engages over 13,000 independently-contracted insurance agents. Refer to Management's Discussion & Analysis for exclusive agent counts.

People, Culture, and Community

At Globe Life, we are united by our mission to—Make Tomorrow Better1 and this starts with our employees and agents. Beyond providing insurance protection for millions of individuals, serving our policyholders and generating financial results for our shareholders, we focus on cultivating a healthy, positive culture and a thriving community within and among our campuses that is inclusive of and attractive for all. Globe Life promotes a diverse work force, where differences are celebrated and inclusiveness is embraced, to better enable our employees to consistently achieve outstanding individual and collective results. Our commitment to diversity starts at the top; of the 11 independent Board members, 45% are women and 18% are racial/ethnic minorities. 

1Per the Globe Life Employee Handbook, the Globe Life mission statement is "We help families Make Tomorrow Better by working to protect their financial future."

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We conduct a confidential survey biennially to give our employees the opportunity to provide candid feedback about their experiences at the Company, including but not limited to, confidence in the Company and leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefit package, and departmental relationships. The results are shared with our employees, reviewed by senior leadership, and used to identify areas for improvement and create action plans based on the employee feedback received.

We strive to Make Tomorrow Better, in part by giving financial and service contributions to programs that provide hands-on assistance in the communities where we live, work, serve, and visit. We focus our charitable giving on organizations that support children, families, veterans, and seniors, as well as those that work to ensure people are able to live full, healthy lives. These categories align with our mission to help families make tomorrow better by working to protect their financial future. In 2021, we provided financial support of approximately $2.6 million to organizations within that focus, including charities that support underserved communities, provide scholarships to youth, and advance equity and diversity efforts. 

Talent Development

At Globe Life, we believe investing in our employees through training and development is paramount to their success. We have developed a learning ecosystem that includes a multitude of professional development opportunities, including online, self-directed, and instructor-led courses on a variety of topics. An education assistance program is also offered to facilitate growth in an area related to one's current position with the Company. 

Health, Safety, and Wellness 

We strive to provide a safe and healthy work environment for every employee. We furnish employees with numerous tools and trainings throughout the year to help ensure they have, at their fingertips, the best information to safely engage with co-workers, customers, and third parties. In furtherance of our commitment to our employees, we offer a comprehensive employee benefits package that includes competitive monetary benefits, retirement benefits through a Section 401(k) plan and a qualified pension to eligible employees, fitness center reimbursement,

The Company remains committed to the well-being and safety of its employees, agents, customers, guests, vendors, and shareholders in our resolve to maintain a stable and secure business environment. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our crisis management and incident response teams guided the Company through an expedited, yet smooth, transition towards working remotely. We efficiently transitioned approximately 80-85% of the Company's total workforce, excluding agents, to working remotely and continued to operate in a mostly remote capacity throughout 2021, allowing individuals to return to our campuses on a limited and voluntary basis. As we transition out of our pandemic response phase, we will continue to provide our employees flexible workplace options and flexible schedule opportunities, as appropriate by the department and role requirements. The Company successfully transitioned most sales and recruiting of agents to a virtual experience in 2020. Agency operations mostly remained a virtual experience during 2021, providing limited occurrences of in-person exposure. The agency operations will continue to offer both virtual and in-person experiences.
