Basis of Reportable Segments

The Company reports its segment information in the same way that management internally organizes its business for assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources. The Company has three reportable operating segments: The Americas Group, Consumer Brands Group and Performance Coatings Group (individually, a “Reportable Segment” and collectively, the “Reportable Segments”). The Company reports all other business activities and immaterial operating segments that are not reportable in the Administrative segment. For more information about the Reportable Segments, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. 

The Americas Group

The Americas Group consisted of 4,859 company-operated specialty paint stores in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean region at December 31, 2021. Each store in this segment is engaged in servicing the needs of architectural and industrial paint contractors and do-it-yourself homeowners. These stores market and sell Sherwin-Williams® and other controlled brand architectural paint and coatings, protective and marine products, OEM product finishes and related products. The majority of these products are produced by manufacturing facilities in the Consumer Brands Group. In addition, each store sells select purchased associated products. In addition to our stores in the Latin America region, The Americas Group meets regional customer demands through developing, licensing, manufacturing, distributing and selling a variety of architectural paints, coatings and related products in North and South America. The loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the business of this segment. At December 31, 2021, The Americas Group consisted of operations from subsidiaries in 10 foreign countries.

Consumer Brands Group

The Consumer Brands Group supplies a broad portfolio of branded and private-label architectural paint, stains, varnishes, industrial products, wood finishes products, wood preservatives, applicators, corrosion inhibitors, aerosols, caulks and adhesives to retailers and distributors throughout North America, as well as in China and Europe. The Consumer Brands Group also supports the Company’s other businesses around the world with new product research and development, manufacturing, distribution and logistics. Approximately 62% of the total sales of the Consumer Brands Group in 2021 were intersegment transfers of products primarily sold through The Americas Group. At December 31, 2021, the Consumer Brands Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in 5 foreign countries. Sales and marketing of certain controlled brand and private-label products is performed by a direct sales staff. The products distributed through third-party customers are intended for resale to the ultimate end-user of the product. The Consumer Brands Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales and related profitability of the segment. This segment incurred most of the Company’s capital expenditures related to ongoing environmental compliance measures at sites currently in operation.

Performance Coatings Group

The Performance Coatings Group develops and sells industrial coatings for wood finishing and general industrial (metal and plastic) applications, automotive refinish, protective and marine coatings, coil coatings, packaging coatings and performance-

based resins and colorants worldwide. This segment licenses certain technology and trade names worldwide. Sherwin-Williams® and other controlled brand products are distributed through The Americas Group and this segment’s 282 company-operated branches and by a direct sales staff and outside sales representatives to retailers, dealers, jobbers, licensees and other third-party distributors. The Performance Coatings Group had sales to certain customers that, individually, may be a significant portion of the sales of the segment. However, the loss of any single customer would not have a material adverse effect on the overall profitability of the segment. At December 31, 2021, the Performance Coatings Group consisted of operations in the United States and subsidiaries in 44 foreign countries.

Administrative Segment

The Administrative segment includes the administrative expenses of the Company’s corporate headquarters site. Also included in the Administrative segment is interest expense, interest and investment income, certain expenses related to closed facilities and environmental-related matters, and other expenses which are not directly associated with the Reportable Segments. The Administrative segment does not include any significant foreign operations. Also included in the Administrative segment is the operations of a real estate management unit that is responsible for the ownership, management, and leasing of non-retail properties held primarily for use by the Company, including the Company’s headquarters site, and disposal of idle facilities. Sales of this segment represent external leasing revenue of excess headquarters space or leasing of facilities no longer used by the Company in its primary businesses. Material gains and losses from the sale of property are infrequent and not a significant operating factor in determining the performance of the Administrative segment.

Raw Materials and Products Purchased for Resale

Raw materials and products purchased for resale make up the majority of our consolidated cost of goods sold. Raw materials may vary considerably by the specific paint or coating being manufactured but can generally be divided into the following categories: resins and latex, pigments, additives, solvents, and metal or plastic containers. A significant portion of these raw materials are derived from various upstream petrochemical and related commodity feedstocks, notably propylene. Raw materials are sourced from multiple suppliers globally, typically within the geographic region where our products are being manufactured. A small portion of specialized resins and other products are manufactured in house. We also purchase a variety of products for resale that are highly complementary to our paint and coating offerings, notably spray equipment and parts, floorcovering, and assorted sundries. We attempt, if feasible, to mitigate our potential risk associated with the sourcing of our raw materials and other products through inventory management, strategic relationships with key suppliers, alternative sourcing strategies and long-term investments to expand our manufacturing capabilities. See Item 1A Risk Factors for more information regarding cost and sourcing of raw materials. 

Seasonality

The majority of the sales for the Reportable Segments traditionally occur during the second and third quarters. However, periods of economic downturn can alter these seasonal patterns. There is no significant seasonality in sales for the Administrative segment. 

Working Capital

In order to meet increased demand during the second and third quarters, the Company usually builds its inventories during the first quarter. Working capital items (inventories and accounts receivable) are generally financed through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of the Company’s liquidity and capital resources, see the “Financial Condition, Liquidity and Cash Flow” section in Item 7. 

Trademarks and Trade Names

Customer recognition of trademarks and trade names owned or licensed by the Company collectively contribute significantly to our sales. The major trademarks and trade names used by each of the Reportable Segments are set forth below.

•The Americas Group: Sherwin-Williams®, Cashmere®, Colorgin®, Condor®, Duration®, Emerald®, Harmony®, Kem Tone®, Loxon®, Metalatex®, Novacor®, PaintShield®, ProClassic®, ProCraft®, ProIndustrial™, ProMar®, SuperDeck®, SuperPaint®, Woodscapes®

Patents

Although patents and licenses are not of material importance to our business as a whole or any segment, The Americas Group and the Performance Coatings Group derive a portion of their income from the licensing of technology, trademarks and trade names to foreign companies.

Backlog and Productive Capacity

Backlog orders are not typically significant in the business of any Reportable Segment since there is normally a short period of time between the placing of an order and shipment. During 2021, we experienced raw material shortages, labor constraints, and weather-related shutdowns that impacted our production and ability to meet customer orders. We believe that sufficient productive capacity currently exists to fulfill our needs for paint, coatings and related products during 2022.

Competition

We experience competition from many local, regional, national and international competitors of various sizes in the manufacture, distribution and sale of our paint, coatings and related products. We are a leading manufacturer and retailer of paint, coatings and related products to professional, industrial, commercial and retail customers, however, our competitive position varies for our different products and markets.

In The Americas Group, competitors include other paint and wallpaper stores, mass merchandisers, home centers, independent hardware stores, hardware chains and manufacturer-operated direct outlets. Product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, service and price determine the competitive advantage for this segment.

In the Consumer Brands Group, domestic and foreign competitors include manufacturers and distributors of branded and private-label paint and coatings products. Technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price are the key competitive factors for this segment.

The Performance Coatings Group has numerous competitors in its domestic and foreign markets with broad product offerings and several others with niche products. Key competitive factors for this segment include technology, product quality, product innovation, breadth of product line, technical expertise, distribution, service and price.

The Administrative segment has many competitors consisting of other real estate owners, developers and managers in areas in which this segment owns property. The main competitive factors are the availability of property and price.

Human Capital Resources

We believe our people are central to the foundation and future of the Company’s success. Our culture and commitment to our people are important factors in attracting, retaining, developing and progressing qualified talent. At December 31, 2021, we employed 61,626 people worldwide, of which 78% were in the United States and 22% were in other global regions.

Purpose and Culture. Our commitment to our people is embedded in our corporate purpose and guiding values. Our purpose is to inspire and improve the world by coloring and protecting what matters. We fulfill this purpose through the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of innovative paint and coatings products, striving to deliver benefits for all major stakeholders, including our employees. The Company’s seven guiding values — integrity, people, service, quality, performance, innovation and growth — influence how we fulfill our purpose, emphasize our commitment to our people and serve as the foundation of our culture of excellence. We value and support our people through, among other initiatives, our inclusion, diversity and equity, talent acquisition, employee engagement, and occupational health and safety initiatives, and our employment practices and total rewards programs. 

Inclusion, Diversity and Equity. We are committed to fostering a culture of inclusion where differences are welcomed, appreciated and celebrated to positively impact our people and business. Reflected in the Company’s Code of Conduct and reinforced through our actions, training and attitudes, fostering an inclusive culture is a moral and business imperative. The building blocks of our inclusion, diversity and equity strategy include:

•Educate and communicate to drive success: Building awareness of inclusive leadership behaviors to leverage the unique contributions of each employee to positively impact our people and business results.

•Fill the pipeline with the best talent: Attracting the best talent pool that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we serve and do business. 

•Develop and engage talent by investing in our people: Investing in our people by providing networking and learning opportunities to drive retention, progression and engagement.

•Progress talent by embedding equity into talent planning: Embedding equity into talent practices, processes, tools and resources at all levels.

Our continuous efforts to create a supportive, welcoming environment across our global footprint is the shared responsibility of all employees, including our senior leaders. Our senior leaders attend an inclusion, diversity and equity learning session to assist us in maintaining our commitment to leading with inclusion and embracing and leveraging the diversity of our workforce.

Talent Acquisition and Employee Engagement. We are committed to providing our people with opportunities to learn, grow and be recognized for their achievements. Through our integrated talent management strategy, we strive to attract, retain, develop and progress a workforce that embraces our culture of inclusion and reflects our diversity efforts. The Company’s early talent programs, including our management trainee program, play a critical role in attracting and progressing a diverse pipeline of talent. During 2021, we hired approximately 1,400 talented people through our management trainee program as part of our long-term growth initiatives.

We are also committed to investing in our people by providing learning and employee networking opportunities to drive retention, progression and engagement and help them excel in their current and future roles. During 2021, our employees completed thousands of hours of online and instructor-led courses across a broad range of categories, including leadership, inclusion, diversity and equity, professional skills, technical and compliance.

Occupational Health and Safety. We are committed to providing safe and healthy working environments for our employees. We have a continued focus on Environmental, Health and Safety (EHS) excellence that involves enhancing employee health and safety, process safety, occupational health and taking reasonable preventative measures to reduce workplace injuries to protect the health and safety of our employees. We strive for incident-free workplaces — continuously assessing and developing the programs that are in place to help keep our employees, customers and communities safe. 

Since the onset of the pandemic, we have implemented significant modifications to our health and safety programs, which were designed to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers from COVID-19. These efforts have included, but are not limited to: requiring social distancing; permitting remote, alternate and flexible work arrangements where possible; enhancing cleaning and sanitation procedures; restricting domestic and international travel; developing return to work and visitor screening protocols; and postponing or cancelling the hosting or attending of large events.

Employment Practices and Total Rewards. We are committed to the fair, consistent and equitable treatment of our employees in relation to working conditions, wages, benefits, policies and procedures. To this end, the Company’s policies and programs are designed to respond to the needs of our employees in a manner that provides a safe, professional, efficient and rewarding workplace. Our total rewards programs are designed to offer competitive compensation, comprehensive benefits and other programs to support employees’ growth, both personally and professionally, and the diverse needs and well-being of our employees worldwide. 

Over the past two years, we enhanced certain of the Company’s benefits and practices to support the health and well-being of our employees through the challenges of the pandemic and significant supply chain disruptions caused by Winter Storm Uri and Hurricane Ida — two natural disasters that occurred during 2021. Our enhanced benefits have included tele-health, paid sick leave, family leave and voluntary leave of absence policies and programs. We also have rewarded our employees’ resiliency and hard work and made changes in our business to encourage retention, including wage increases, reduced store hours and employee benefits enhancements. 

For additional information regarding our response to the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions, see the information included within Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
