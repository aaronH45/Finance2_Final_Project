PART I

ITEM 1. Business

General

We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2021, 71% of our $67.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 62% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 28% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity.

We operate in an environment characterized by both complexity in global security and continuing economic pressures in the U.S. and globally. A significant component of our strategy in this environment is to focus on program execution, improving the quality and predictability of the delivery of our products and services, and placing security capability quickly into the hands of our U.S. and international customers at affordable prices. Recognizing that our customers are resource constrained, we place considerable focus on affordability initiatives while endeavoring to develop and extend our portfolio domestically in a disciplined manner, with a focus on adjacent markets close to our core capabilities as well as growing our international sales. We invest substantially in our people to ensure we have the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally on innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We will continue to invest in acquisitions, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures, and equity investments.

We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.

Pending Acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc.

On December 20, 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings, Inc. (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for $51.00 per share, which is net of a $5.00 per share special cash dividend Aerojet Rocketdyne paid to its stockholders on March 24, 2021. At the time of announcement, this represented a post-dividend equity value of approximately $4.6 billion, on a fully diluted as-converted basis, and a transaction value of approximately $4.4 billion after the assumption of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s then-projected net cash. The transaction was approved by Aerojet Rocketdyne’s stockholders on March 9, 2021. As part of the regulatory review process of the transaction, on September 24, 2021, we and Aerojet Rocketdyne each certified substantial compliance with the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) requests for additional information, known as a “second request.” On January 11, 2022, the parties provided an updated notice of their intended closing date under their timing agreement with the FTC, whereby the parties agreed that they would not close the transaction before January 27, 2022, to enable the parties to discuss the scope and nature of the merchant supply and firewall commitments previously offered to the FTC by Lockheed Martin. We have been advised by the FTC that its concerns regarding the transaction cannot be addressed adequately by the terms of a consent order. We believe it is highly likely that the FTC will vote to sue to block the transaction and expect they will make a decision before January 27, 2022. If the FTC sues to block the transaction, we could elect to defend the lawsuit within 30 days or terminate the merger agreement. If the FTC does not file a lawsuit to block the transaction before January 27, 2022, the parties could proceed to close the transaction, but there is no assurance that the FTC would not file a lawsuit challenging the transaction after the closing since the parties have not reached agreement on the terms of a consent order. Under the terms of the merger agreement, either party may terminate the transaction if it has not closed on or before March 21, 2022. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of the risks related to the proposed transaction.

Table of Contents 

Aeronautics is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics also has contracts with the U.S. Government for classified programs. Aeronautics’ major programs include:

•F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter - international multi-role, multi-variant, fifth generation stealth fighter;

•C-130 Hercules - international tactical airlifter;

•F-16 Fighting Falcon - low-cost, combat-proven, international multi-role fighter; and

•F-22 Raptor - air dominance and multi-role fifth generation stealth fighter. 

The F-35 program is our largest program, generating 27% of our total consolidated net sales, as well as 68% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2021. The F-35 program consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts. Development is focused on modernization of F-35’s capability and addressing emerging threats. Sustainment provides logistics and training support for the aircraft delivered to F-35 customers. 

Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy; commitments from our seven international partner countries and six international customers; and expressions of interest from other countries. In 2021, we delivered 142 aircraft, including 68 to international customers, resulting in total deliveries of 753 production aircraft since program inception. This was an increase from the 120 aircraft delivered in 2020 when the production rate was tapered as a result of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) related delays. While the production rate in 2021 improved from its 2020 levels, it continued to be impacted by COVID-19. We anticipate delivering 148-153 aircraft in 2022. In 2023 and beyond, we anticipate delivering 156 aircraft for the foreseeable future. We have 230 aircraft in backlog as of December 31, 2021 extending into 2023, including orders from our international partner countries. For additional information on the F-35 program, see “Status of the F‑35 Program” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See also Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to the F-35 program.

Aeronautics produces and provides support and sustainment services for the C-130J Super Hercules, as well as upgrades and support services for the legacy C-130 Hercules worldwide fleet. We delivered 22 C-130J aircraft in 2021. We have 79 aircraft in our backlog as of December 31, 2021, extending into 2025.

Aeronautics produces F-16 aircraft for international customers and continues to provide service-life extension, modernization and other upgrade programs for our customers’ F‑16 aircraft, with existing contracts continuing for several years. As of December 31, 2021, we have 128 F-16 aircraft in backlog, extending into 2027. We continue to seek international opportunities to deliver additional aircraft.

Table of Contents 

accounted for 8% of Space’s net sales. Net sales from Space’s satellite products and services represented 10% of our total consolidated net sales in 2021 and 11% in 2020 and 2019.

As previously announced, on June 30, 2021 the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK’s nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly, the AWE program, including the entity that manages the program, was no longer included in our financial results as of that date.

Space is engaged in the research and development, design, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems.

Intellectual Property

We routinely apply for and own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, we develop and own other intellectual property, including copyrights, trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how, which contribute significantly to our business. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) provide that the U.S. Government obtains certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. Government may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property. See the discussion of matters related to our intellectual property within Item 1A - Risk Factors. Non-U.S. governments may also have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contracts for them. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.

Research and Development

We conduct research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded R&D or independent research and development (IR&D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded R&D) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related test activities. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Research and development and similar costs”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Raw Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality

Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. Historically, we have been successful in obtaining the raw materials and other supplies needed in our manufacturing processes. We seek to manage raw materials supply risk through long-term contracts and by maintaining an acceptable level of the key materials in inventories.

Aluminum and titanium are important raw materials used in certain of our Aeronautics and Space programs. Long-term agreements have helped enable a continued supply of aluminum and titanium. Carbon fiber is an important ingredient in composite materials used in our Aeronautics programs, such as the F-35 aircraft. We have been advised by some suppliers that pricing and the timing of availability of materials in some commodities markets can fluctuate widely. These fluctuations may 

6

Table of Contents 

negatively affect the price and availability of certain materials. While we do not anticipate material problems regarding the supply of our raw materials and believe that we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate these variations, if key materials become unavailable or if pricing fluctuates widely in the future, it could result in delay of one or more of our programs, increased costs or reduced operating profits or cash flows. 

We rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, including advanced microelectronics such as semiconductors, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. A failure by one or more of these suppliers or subcontractors to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis, according to specifications, or at all, may affect our ability to perform our obligations. While we believe we have taken appropriate measures to mitigate these risks, supplier disruptions, including as a result of COVID-19, could result in delays, increased costs, or reduced operating profits or cash flows. For more information on the risks related to our suppliers and raw materials, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods, including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.

Human Capital Resources

Due to the specialized nature of our business, our performance depends on identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce in multiple areas, including engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Our human capital management strategy, which we refer to as our people strategy, is tightly aligned with our business needs and technology strategy. During 2021, our human capital efforts were focused on continuing to accelerate the transformation of our technology for workforce management through investments in upgraded systems and processes, and continuing to increase our agility to meet the quickly changing needs of the business, all while maintaining a respectful, challenging, supportive and inclusive working environment. We use a variety of human capital measures in managing our business, including: workforce demographics; hiring metrics; talent management metrics, including retention rates of top talent; and diversity metrics with respect to representation, attrition, hiring, promotions and leadership.

Workforce Demographics

As of December 31, 2021, we had a highly skilled workforce made up of approximately 114,000 employees, including approximately 59,000 engineers, scientists and information technology professionals. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 93% of our workforce was located in the U.S. and approximately 20% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year. Historically, we have been successful in negotiating renewals to expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities, and management considers employee and union relations to be good.

Diversity and Inclusion

Diversity and inclusion is a business imperative for us, as we believe that it is key to our future success. We have focused our diversity and inclusion initiatives on employee recruitment, including investments in minority-serving institutions and outreach, employee training and development, such as efforts focused on expanding the diverse talent pipeline, and employee engagement, including through participation in our employee Business Resource Groups. Our Business Resource Groups are voluntary, employee-led groups that are open to all employees while focusing on workplace issues specific to racial/ethnic, gender, sexual orientation/gender identity, disability or veteran status. The Business Resource Groups foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with our organizational mission, values, goals and business practices and drive awareness and change within our organization. Through these and other focused efforts, we have improved the diversity of our overall U.S. workforce and within leadership positions, specifically in the representation of women, people of color and people with disabilities. Additionally, our representation of veterans remains outstanding, at almost four times the current annual national percentage of veterans in the civilian workforce.

Employee Profile (as of December 31, 2021):[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Based on employees who self-identify. Includes only U.S. employees and expatriates except for women, which also includes local country nationals. Excludes casual workers, interns/co-ops and employees of certain subsidiaries and joint ventures.

(b)Executive is defined as director-level (one level below vice president) or higher.

Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development

We strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. During 2021, we hired more than 10,000 employees, despite the continuing challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. An integral part of our people strategy is early career hiring through college and intern pipelines, particularly in technical fields. In addition to efforts focused on recruitment, we also monitor employee attrition across a broad array of categories and segments of the population, including with respect to diversity and top talent. Critical to attracting and retaining top talent is employee satisfaction, and we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and to understand the effectiveness of our people strategy. We attract and reward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefit practices, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to nonrepresented employees of all levels in our organization and encourage excellence through our pay-for-performance philosophy. We also have continued a teleworking policy that encourages flexible working arrangements for employees who can meet our customer commitments remotely, which we believe helps recruit and retain talent. In addition, we invest in the development of our employees through training, apprenticeship programs, leadership development plans and offering tuition assistance programs for continuing education or industry certifications. This employee development helps to make us more competitive and also assists with leadership succession planning throughout the corporation.

Employee Safety and Health

Our safety and health program seeks to optimize our operations through targeted safety, health and wellness opportunities designed to ensure safe work conditions, a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. As part of this program, we track employee health and safety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of injury and illness incidents that occur at work, those incidents that result in days lost, and the number of days lost due to workplace injuries and illness. During 2021, these metrics continued to be negatively impacted by the absence from work and delays in the return to work related to COVID-19. We continue to take steps to protect our employees from COVID-19 while sustaining production and related services, including by establishing minimum staffing and social distancing and mask wearing policies consistent with current governmental guidance, cleaning common areas more frequently, implementing a flexible teleworking policy for employees who can work from home, encouraging employee vaccinations while monitoring potential vaccine mandates, and instituting other measures designed to mitigate and prevent the spread of COVID-19.

For information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Competition

Our broad portfolio of products and services competes both domestically and internationally against products and services of other large aerospace and defense companies, numerous smaller competitors and, increasingly, emerging competitors, including startups and non-traditional defense contractors. Changes within the industry we operate in, such as vertical integration by our peers, could negatively impact us without appropriate remedies to protect our interests. We often form teams with our competitors in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix of capabilities to address specific requirements. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage expanded competition. Principal factors of competition include the value of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the ability to develop and implement complex, integrated system architectures; total cost of ownership; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirements; and our ability to provide timely and cost effective solutions. Technological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data analytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to space are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors.

The competition for international sales is generally subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We may compete against U.S. and non-

8

Table of Contents 

U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by international governments. International competitions also may be subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments that may affect how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its industrial cooperation programs are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset agreements as part of securing some international business. For more information concerning offset agreements, see “Contractual Commitments” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Government Contracts and Regulations

Our business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries and they regulate our non-FMS international sales. Additionally, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with U.S. and international regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.

We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other governments’ contracts, including foreign governments. These laws and regulations, among other things:

•require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations; 

•impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP);

•impose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define which costs can be charged to the U.S. Government, how and when costs can be charged, and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain U.S. Government and foreign contracts; 

•require specific security controls to protect U.S. Government controlled unclassified information and restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data; and compliance with cyber security regulations by our supply chain; and

•require the review and approval of contractor business systems, defined in the regulations as: (i) Accounting System; (ii) Estimating System; (iii) Earned Value Management System, for managing cost and schedule performance on certain complex programs; (iv) Purchasing System; (v) Material Management and Accounting System, for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material; and (vi) Property Management System. 

The U.S. Government and other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at its convenience or for default based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs. If a contract is terminated for default, we generally are entitled to payments for our work that has been accepted by the U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce the contract value or recover its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ right to terminate our contracts and the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A - Risk Factors. For more information regarding government contracting laws and regulations, see Item 1A - Risk Factors as well as “Critical Accounting Policies - Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Additionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under undefinitized contract actions (UCAs), which means that we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. Although in most cases we historically have reached mutual agreement to definitize our UCAs, the U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts and has done so in the past. Absent a successful appeal of such action, the unilateral definitization of the contract obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government’s power to unilaterally definitize a contract can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.

A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified contracts are included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks and capital requirements associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are consistent with our internal controls for our non-classified contracts.

Our operations are subject to and affected by various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment. As a result of these environmental protection laws, we are involved in environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our prior activities and those of our predecessor companies. While the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect on our earnings, financial position and cash flow, primarily because substantially all of our environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 15 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also the discussion of environmental matters within Item 1A - Risk Factors.

There is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change. Future laws, regulations or policies in response to concerns over GHG emissions such as carbon taxes, mandatory reporting and disclosure obligations and changes in procurement policies could significantly increase our operational and compliance burdens and costs. We monitor developments in climate-change related regulation for their potential effect on us and also have a comprehensive sustainability program that seeks to mitigate our impact on the environment, including targets to reduce our GHG emissions. For more information on the risk of climate-change related regulation, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains statements that, to the extent they are not recitations of historical fact, constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws and are based on our current expectations and assumptions. The words “believe,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “project,” “intend,” “expect,” “plan,” “outlook,” “scheduled,” “forecast” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties.

Statements and assumptions with respect to future sales, income and cash flows, program performance, the outcome of litigation, anticipated pension cost and funding, environmental remediation cost estimates, planned acquisitions or dispositions of assets, or the anticipated consequences are examples of forward-looking statements. Numerous factors, including the risk factors described in the following section, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements.

Our actual financial results likely will be different from those projected due to the inherent nature of projections. Given these uncertainties, forward-looking statements should not be relied on in making investment decisions. The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K speak only as of the date of its filing. Except where required by applicable law, we expressly disclaim a duty to provide updates to forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 10-K to reflect
