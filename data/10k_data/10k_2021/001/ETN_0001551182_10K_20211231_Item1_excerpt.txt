Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General 

Raw Materials

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, lead, silver, gold, titanium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, chemicals, and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as bar stock, extrusions, castings, forgings, powder metal, coils, sheets, strips, stampings, plastic resins and pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. However, as global economies recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, some of our businesses were impacted by inflation and supply chain constraints, including limited availability of select materials and delivery delays. During this time, we worked closely with our suppliers to manage and minimize the impact on our supply chain. Additional information related to the impact of supply chain constraints and inflation is presented in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K.

Patents and Trademarks

Eaton considers its intellectual property, including without limitation patents, trade names, domain names, trademarks, confidential information, and trade secrets to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold using a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements.

Environmental Contingencies

Our comprehensive sustainability strategy is driven by our mission to improve the quality of life and the environment. We are committed to reducing our footprint, eliminating waste, and making the best use of natural resources. Operations of the Company involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon capital expenditures, including expenditures for environmental control facilities, earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Compliance with future environmental protection laws may require an increase in capital expenditures. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Eaton has approximately 86,000 employees globally. The number of persons employed by our reportable segments and corporate at December 31, 2021 are as follows:

Eaton uses and monitors a variety of metrics to ensure our objectives related to employee attraction, development, and retention are met. Most notably, Eaton tracks the following:

Inclusion and Diversity

Eaton is committed to having a workforce that is diverse and inclusive at all levels, reflecting the diversity of our customers and communities. Our success depends on our ability to attract and retain the best employees without regard to race, color, social or economic status, religion, national origin, marital status, age, veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any protected status. It is the policy of the Company to make all decisions regarding employment, including hiring, compensation, training, promotions, transfers, or lay-offs, based on the principle of equal employment opportunity and without discrimination. 

At December 31, 2021, Eaton’s distribution by gender, and United States distribution by minority status, is as follows:

At Eaton, one of our aspirational goals is to be a model of inclusion and diversity among our peers. Our plan to achieve this goal encompasses a number of actions, including an examination into our programs, practices, processes, and policies to look for opportunities to strengthen our support of underrepresented individuals, groups and businesses across our operations. 

Compensation

A key component of Eaton’s attraction and retention strategy is competitive compensation. Eaton regularly benchmarks its compensation practices with industry peers to maintain a top performing workforce. Eaton’s 2021 total employee costs was $5.5 billion including salaries, wages, equity-based compensation, pension and other benefits. The total compensation of our median employee on October 1, 2020, as reported in our 2021 Proxy Statement filed in March 2021, and as calculated in accordance with Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K, was $63,951.

Safety

Throughout our operations, our goal is to have no safety incidents and we continue to make progress towards that goal. For example, in 2020 we reduced our Total Recordable Case Rate (TRCR) by 26% (0.40) and our Days Away Case Rate (DACR) by 26% (0.17) compared to 2019. Our TRCR of 0.40 approaches our long-term goal of 0.25, which we believe is a world-class safety rate. 

Further, in 2021, the Company took a number of measures to continue to protect our workforce from the COVID-19 pandemic, including the following as appropriate:

•Training our employees at sites around the world in cleaning and disinfecting protocols

•Enacting social distancing procedures, staggered shifts, a rotating office work schedule, and modified workspace and meeting space layouts as appropriate

•Requiring employees to stay at home if they are feeling ill, and encouraging increased hand washing and hygiene practices across all sites

•Advising employees to take advantage of flexible work options

•Restricting visitors to all sites

•Encouraging vaccination for all employees and at select locations, arranging for vaccination clinics and transportation

•Consulting regularly with doctors and health care organizations

•Updating the Company's response plan as new information became available

In the event an employee suspects they have been exposed to COVID-19, or testing confirms it, sites will implement a response plan that includes:

•Communication with all who may have been exposed

•Disinfecting work stations and common areas

•Shutting down the facility if warranted

These actions are aligned with preventive health protocols of governmental authorities and health organizations including the Centers for Disease Control (U.S.) and the World Health Organization.

Achieving work-life balance

Achieving work-life balance is a common concern of today's employees. Flexible work solutions and inclusive programs will help us remain competitive in attracting and retaining the best talent and make it possible for employees in varied situations to be able to remain at Eaton. Flexible solutions include compressed work weeks, remote working, job sharing, part-time work, flextime, and telework. 

Engagement

Fully engaged employees are more productive, innovative, and satisfied in their work. Examples of how we engage our employees include enterprise-wide town halls, hosting informal listening meetings and surveying groups of employees on specific subjects. In addition, we have programs focused on career development of employees at all levels. Our 2021 survey on employee engagement showed a favorable response from 83 percent of employees who completed it. This group reported that they were proud to work at Eaton, felt personal accomplishment from their work, and would recommend Eaton as a place to work. We are committed to a wide range of strategies designed to improve and sustain employee engagement over the long-term.
