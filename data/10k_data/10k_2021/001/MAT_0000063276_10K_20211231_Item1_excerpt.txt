North America Segment

The North America segment markets and sells toys and consumer products in the United States and Canada across all of Mattel's categories.

Dolls

Barbie will continue to deliver innovation, purpose-driven marketing campaigns, and engaging toys connected to a strong system of play. Barbie has broad product offerings, with product lines designed to appeal to children from ages three to nine, complemented by a Barbie Signature line with high-quality dolls that appeal to fans of all ages. In 2022, Barbie will be featured in four Netflix content releases, introduce exciting new launches in the Extra and Reveal product lines, and introduce high profile partnerships and pop culture collaborations, all while celebrating the 60th anniversary of the Dreamhouse and the launch of an all-new Dream Camper.

In 2022, Polly Pocket will refresh its product offering with new compact playset innovation, brand new themes, and the fourth season of its popular animated content series on streaming and broadcast platforms globally. There are also two new product launches in Fall 2022; a product line tied to Chris "Ludacris" Bridges' series "Karma's World" and the much-anticipated re-launch of the powerhouse franchise Monster High.

Infant, Toddler, and Preschool

In 2022, Fisher-Price will continue its focus on surprising and delighting consumers as a trusted partner for families with infants and preschoolers, by continuing to create brand love through innovative products and inviting adults back into the world of childhood. Design-led innovation will continue to drive new product offerings, including Meditation Mouse, a calming toy for toddlers designed to teach self-soothing techniques, and expansion of the Linkamals product line to toddlers.

New preschool toys from Imaginext will include product lines associated with highly-anticipated theatrical releases: The Batman (Warner Brothers), Jurassic World: Dominion (NBCUniversal), and Lightyear (Disney Pixar).

Vehicles

In 2022, industry leader Hot Wheels will look to continue its strong momentum as a multigenerational franchise with consumer interest levels at historic highs. Hot Wheels product offerings will excite and delight with revitalized Hot Wheels City playsets for expanded fun across the system of play, new product lines for the Jurassic World: Dominion (NBCUniversal) and Lightyear (Disney Pixar) theatrical releases, and digital ways to collect with the NFT Garage series.

Action Figures, Building Sets, Games, and Other

Mattel Action Figures will continue to collaborate with key licensor partners, such as Disney, NBCUniversal, WWE, and Microsoft, to bring innovative products to the global marketplace. Key 2022 product lines to be based on entertainment franchises include NBCUniversal’s Jurassic World: Dominion, Minions: Rise of Gru, and Disney Pixar’s Lightyear, each with a theatrical release scheduled for Summer 2022. Mattel will complement its portfolio with the continued expansion of Masters of the Universe.

5

Mattel Plush will collaborate with partners Disney’s Lucasfilm, Pixar, and Marvel, Microsoft’s Minecraft, NBCUniversal’s Jurassic World, and many more. In 2022, the Plush portfolio is expected to benefit from multiple tentpole moments capitalizing on this strong entertainment slate. 

International Segment

Products marketed and sold by the International segment are generally the same as those marketed and sold by the North America segment, although some are developed or adapted for particular international markets. Mattel’s products are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. No individual country within the International segment exceeded 6% of worldwide consolidated net sales during 2021.

American Girl Segment

The American Girl segment is a direct marketer, retailer, and children’s publisher dedicated to its mission to help girls grow up with confidence and character. American Girl is best known for its line of historical and contemporary characters that feature 18” dolls, books, and accessories that inspire girls to face the world with courage, resilience, and kindness. The contemporary Truly Me and Create Your Own lines encourage girls to express their imaginations and creativity by choosing a doll that looks like them or custom-creating one that’s completely unique from more than one million options. Bitty Baby introduces younger girls to nurturing play until they are ready for WellieWishers, a sweet group of girls who focus on empathy and being a good friend. American Girl also publishes best-selling fiction and non-fiction books, as well as an array of popular digital content. The American Girl segment sells products directly to consumers via its catalog, website, in its proprietary retail stores in the United States, at select retailers nationwide, and at specialty boutiques and franchise stores in Canada.

In January 2022, American Girl introduced its newest Girl of the Year, Corinne Tan. Corinne is a Chinese American growing up with her family in Aspen, Colorado. She loves hitting the slopes, being a big sister, and training her new puppy to be a search-and-rescue dog.

Competition and Industry Background

Mattel is a worldwide leader in the manufacture, marketing, and sale of toys, games, and other products related to play, learning, and development. Competition in the toy industry is based primarily on quality, play value, brands, and price. Mattel offers a diverse range of products for children of all ages and families that include, among others, toys for infants and preschoolers, dolls, vehicles, action figures, construction toys, youth electronics, games, including digital, puzzles, plush, educational toys, technology-related products, media-driven products, and fashion-related toys. The North America segment competes with several large toy companies, including Hasbro, Jazwares, Just Play Products, LEGO, MGA Entertainment, Melissa & Doug, Spin Master, VTech, Zuru, many smaller toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. The International segment competes with global toy companies including Hasbro, JAKKS Pacific, Just Play Products, LEGO, MGA Entertainment, Playmobil, Ravensburger, Simba, Spin Master, VTech, other national and regional toy companies, and manufacturers of video games and consumer electronics. Foreign regions may include competitors that are strong in a particular toy line or geographical area but do not compete with Mattel or other international toy companies worldwide. The American Girl segment competes with companies that manufacture dolls and accessories, and with children’s book publishers and retailers. 

Competition among the above companies is intensifying due to trends towards shorter life cycles for individual toy products and an increasing use of more sophisticated technology among consumers. In addition, Mattel competes with companies that sell non-toy products, such as electronic consumer products, video games, as well as content and other entertainment companies. Competition continues to be heavily influenced by the fact that a small number of retailers account for a large portion of all toy sales, allocate the shelf space from which toys are viewed, and have direct contact with parents and children through in-store and online purchases. Such retailers can and do promote their own private-label toys, facilitate the sale of competitors’ toys, showcase toys online based on proprietary algorithms, and allocate shelf space to one type of toy over another. Online distributors are able to promote a wide variety of toys and represent a wide variety of toy manufacturers.

Seasonality

Mattel’s business is highly seasonal, with consumers making a large percentage of all toy purchases during the traditional holiday season. A significant portion of Mattel’s customers’ purchasing occurs in the third and fourth quarters of Mattel’s fiscal year in anticipation of holiday buying. These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to Mattel’s business associated with the underproduction of popular toys and the overproduction of less popular toys that do not match consumer demand. Retailers have also been attempting to manage their inventories more tightly in recent years, requiring Mattel to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers. These factors increase the risk that Mattel may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that Mattel’s own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers manage their inventories, Mattel experiences cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause its sales to vary significantly from period to period.

In anticipation of retail sales during the traditional holiday season, Mattel significantly increases its production in advance of the peak selling period, resulting in a corresponding build-up of inventory levels in the first three quarters of its fiscal year. Seasonal shipping patterns result in significant peaks in the third and fourth quarters in the respective levels of inventories and accounts receivable, which result in seasonal working capital financing requirements. See Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Seasonal Financing and Debt."

Sales

Mattel’s products are sold throughout the world. Products within the North America segment are sold directly to retailers, including omnichannel retailers, discount and free-standing toy stores, chain stores, department stores, other retail outlets, and, to a limited extent, wholesalers. Mattel also operates small retail outlets at certain corporate offices as a service to its employees and as an outlet for its products. Products within the International segment are sold directly to retailers and wholesalers in most European, Latin American, and Asian countries, and in Australia and New Zealand, and through agents and distributors in those countries where Mattel has no direct presence. Mattel also has retail outlets in Latin America that serve as outlets for its products. American Girl products and its children's publications are sold directly to consumers and select retailers in North America. Mattel has retail space in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles, California; and New York, New York for its flagship American Girl stores, and in 9 other cities across the United States for its American Girl boutique stores, each of which features children’s products from the American Girl segment. Additionally, Mattel sells certain of its products online through websites of one or more of its subsidiaries.

During 2021, Mattel’s three largest customers (Walmart at $1.17 billion, Target at $0.74 billion, and Amazon at $0.62 billion) accounted for approximately 46% of worldwide consolidated net sales. During 2020, Mattel's three largest customers (Walmart at $1.07 billion, Target at $0.62 billion, and Amazon at $0.47 billion) accounted for approximately 47% of worldwide consolidated net sales. Within countries in the International segment, there is also a concentration of sales to certain large customers that do not operate in the United States, none of which exceeded 10% of worldwide consolidated net sales. The customers and the degree of concentration vary depending upon the region or nation. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Segment Information."

Licenses and Distribution Agreements

Mattel has license agreements with third parties that permit Mattel to utilize the trademark, characters, or inventions of the licensor in products that Mattel sells. A number of these licenses relate to product lines that are significant to Mattel’s business and operations.

Mattel has entered into agreements to license entertainment properties, including among others, Disney Enterprises (including Disney Princess and Frozen, Star Wars, Pixar (including CARS, Lightyear, and Toy Story) and certain other Disney films and television properties), NBCUniversal (including Fast and Furious, Jurassic World, Minions, and Spirit), Viacom International relating to its Nickelodeon properties (including Blaze and the Monster Machines), Warner Bros. (including Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, and Justice League), Microsoft (including Halo and Minecraft), WWE, and Sanrio. 

Royalty expense for 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $184.3 million, $158.5 million, and $220.2 million, respectively. See Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Commitments" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Commitments and Contingencies."

Mattel licenses a number of its trademarks and other property rights to others for use in connection with the sale of their products. Mattel also distributes some third-party finished products that are independently designed and manufactured.

7

Trademarks, Copyrights, and Patents

Most of Mattel’s products are sold under trademarks, trade names, and copyrights, and some of these products incorporate devices or designs for which patent protection has been, or is being, pursued. Trademarks, copyrights, and patents are significant assets of Mattel in that they provide product recognition, acceptance, and exclusive rights to Mattel's innovations around the world.

Mattel customarily seeks trademark, copyright, and/or patent protection covering its products, and it owns or has applications pending or registrations for U.S. and foreign trademarks, copyrights, and patents covering many of its products. Although a number of these trademarks, copyrights, and patents relate to product lines that are significant to Mattel’s business and operations, Mattel does not believe it is dependent on a single trademark, copyright, or patent. Mattel believes its rights to these properties are adequately protected, but there can be no assurance that its rights can be successfully asserted in the future or will not be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged.

Manufacturing and Materials

Mattel manufactures toy products for all segments in both company-owned facilities and through third-party manufacturers. Products are also purchased from unrelated entities that design, develop, and manufacture those products. To provide greater flexibility in the manufacture and delivery of its products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, Mattel has concentrated production of most of its core products in company-owned facilities and generally uses third-party manufacturers for the production of non-core products.

Mattel’s principal manufacturing facilities are located in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Thailand. In conjunction with Mattel's cost savings programs, Mattel discontinued production in 2019 at three plants located in China, Indonesia, and Mexico and discontinued production in 2021 at its plant located in Canada. To help avoid disruption of its product supply due to political instability, civil unrest, economic instability, changes in government policies or regulations, natural and manmade disasters, and other risks, Mattel produces its products in multiple facilities across multiple countries. Mattel believes that the existing production capacity at its owned and third-party manufacturers’ facilities is sufficient to handle expected volume in the foreseeable future.

Mattel bases its production schedules for toy products on customer orders and forecasts, taking into account historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a particular product line. 

The majority of Mattel’s raw materials are available from numerous suppliers but may be subject to fluctuations in price. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."

Advertising and Marketing

Mattel supports its product lines with extensive advertising and consumer promotions. Advertising takes place at varying levels throughout the year and peaks during the traditional holiday season. Advertising includes television and radio commercials, social media, and magazine, newspaper, and internet advertisements. Promotions include in-store displays, sweepstakes, merchandising materials, major events focusing on products, and tie-ins with various consumer products companies.

During 2021, 2020, and 2019, Mattel incurred advertising and promotion expenses of $545.7 million (10.0% of net sales), $525.8 million (11.5% of net sales), and $550.2 million (12.2% of net sales), respectively.

Financial Instruments

Currency exchange rate fluctuations may impact Mattel’s results of operations and cash flows. Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to foreign exchange risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts generally have maturity dates of up to 24 months. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.

For additional information regarding foreign currency contracts, see Part II, Item 7A "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and Part II, Item 8 "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—Derivative Instruments."

Government Regulations

Mattel’s products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and may also be subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some U.S. states. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these federal and state laws and regulations.

Mattel’s products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including the European Union ("EU") and Canada. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.

Mattel maintains a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, Mattel has experienced, and may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on Mattel’s results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required. A product recall could also negatively affect Mattel’s reputation and the sales of other Mattel products. See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."

Mattel’s advertising and marketing activities are subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Children’s Television Act of 1990 and may also be subject to other rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as laws of certain countries that regulate advertising, advertising to children, and related activities. In addition, Mattel’s web-based products and services and other online and digital communications activity are or may be subject to U.S. and foreign privacy-related regulations, including the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the EU General Data Protection Regulation and related national regulations. Privacy-related laws also exist in some U.S. states, including the recently enacted California Consumer Protection Act. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.

Mattel’s worldwide operations are subject to the requirements of various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where those operations are located. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. Mattel’s operations are from time to time the subject of investigations, conferences, discussions, and negotiations with various federal, state, and local environmental agencies within and outside the United States with respect to the discharge or cleanup of hazardous waste. Mattel is not aware of any material cleanup liabilities. In addition, Mattel continues to monitor existing and pending environmental laws and regulations within the United States and elsewhere related to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. 

Mattel is subject to various other federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations applicable to its business. Mattel believes that it is in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.

Human Capital

Mattel believes recruiting, developing, and motivating a talented global workforce are key to its long-term growth and success. Through Mattel’s focus on employee engagement, diversity, equity, and inclusion, training and development, health and safety, and employee well-being, Mattel endeavors to create a supportive and rewarding environment where employees are encouraged to explore, innovate, grow, and lead.

As of December 31, 2021, Mattel had approximately 36,300 employees (including temporary and seasonal employees) working in over 35 countries worldwide to create innovative products and experiences that inspire, entertain, and develop children through play. Approximately 31,900 employees (88% of the total workforce) are located outside the United States, with a significant global manufacturing labor workforce of approximately 27,000 employees. The remaining workforce focuses on the design, marketing, sales, finance, and other aspects of Mattel’s business.

9

Mattel’s Board of Directors and Governance and Social Responsibility Committee are involved in the oversight of how the company fosters its culture and receive regular updates on the company’s workforce management, including its diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.

Employee Engagement

Mattel regularly collects feedback to measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis through its annual global engagement survey, which measures employee job satisfaction and is used to help improve the employee experience and strengthen its workplace culture.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Mattel is committed to fostering a culture where all employees have the opportunity to realize their full potential. Mattel values and shares a wide range of ideas and voices that help evolve and broaden its perspectives, with a reach that extends to consumers, customers, business partners, and suppliers.

In August 2021, Mattel published its 2020 Citizenship Report, which described goals and initiatives related to its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. The report highlighted Mattel’s near-term progress toward achieving its goals as of April 2021, including the following achievements: 

•Achieved 100% base pay equity globally for all employees performing similar work with comparable roles and experience in similar markets. This includes base pay equity by gender globally and pay equity by ethnicity in the United States.

•Increased representation of women at all levels of the organization, with women comprising 58% of Mattel’s global workforce and 49% of all management positions, excluding manufacturing labor. Mattel remains focused on actions to increase such representation, including strengthening relationships with schools, networks, and organizations to establish a talent pipeline of women for Technology, Supply Chain, and Finance positions.

We believe Mattel's Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") are an integral component of fostering an inclusive culture and enhancing engagement at Mattel. Mattel employees have created and lead ten ERGs which, bring together members and allies of underrepresented identities across the global organization. The ERGs organize learning opportunities, cultural celebrations, and community outreach, elevate important issues, encourage open and honest conversations, and collect critical feedback.

Mattel has been recognized for its diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, including by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation as one of the country’s top places to work for LGBTQ+ equality. For the third consecutive year, Mattel received a perfect score on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, a leading benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Mattel was also ranked among Forbes 2021 World’s Best Employers and Best Employers for Women; named to Fast Company’s List of the 100 Best Workplaces for Innovators in 2021 and Newsweek’s 100 Most Loved Workplaces for 2021; and recognized as a Great Place to Work for 2021.

Training and Development

We believe continuously developing skills and capabilities for the future is essential to operating as an IP-driven, high-performing toy company. Additionally, offering the opportunity for employees to continuously learn and grow their careers at Mattel is a key driver of its employee engagement strategy. In 2021, employees at all levels around the globe participated in several hundred thousand hours of learning content across professional, management development, and technical training. This included both online classes and instructor-led training.

Health and Safety, and Employee Well-Being

Mattel is focused on creating a safe and healthy workplace for all of its employees. In 1997, Mattel became one of the first companies to create standards for responsible manufacturing. Since then, these principles have become the foundation for Mattel's Responsible Supply Chain Commitment, a comprehensive set of standards and oversight processes that establish Mattel’s expectations for responsible factory working conditions, environmental protections, social compliance, health, and safety in both its own manufacturing facilities and those of its supply chain partners.

10

Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mattel has prioritized protecting the health and safety of its employees while at the same time mitigating the disruption to its business. Mattel implemented stringent health and safety measures, process controls, operating procedures, and training to help provide a safe and sanitary working environment for employees. Mattel also transitioned employees, as appropriate based on role, to a work-from-home system and increased the use of virtual meeting technologies.

Mattel offers several benefits to promote employee well-being, including flexible work hours and/or paid time off, health and welfare insurance options, retirement plans, and basic and supplemental employee life insurance for eligible individuals. To supplement Mattel’s comprehensive health and wellness programs, it introduced specific programs targeted at unique issues arising during the pandemic, including working from home, maintaining work/life balance, and improving health and happiness.
