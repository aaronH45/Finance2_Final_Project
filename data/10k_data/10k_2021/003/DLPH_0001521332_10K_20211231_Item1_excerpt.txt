Our Company

We believe the automotive industry is being shaped by rapidly increasing consumer demand for new mobility solutions, advanced technologies, including software-defined vehicles, and vehicle connectivity, as well as increasing government regulation related to vehicle safety, fuel efficiency and emissions control. These industry mega-trends, which we refer to as “Safe,” “Green” and “Connected,” are driving higher growth in products that address these trends than growth in the automotive industry overall. We have organized our business into two diversified segments, which enable us to develop technology solutions and manufacture highly-engineered products that enable our customers to respond to these mega-trends:

•Signal and Power Solutions—This segment provides complete design, manufacture and assembly of the vehicle’s electrical architecture, including engineered component products, connectors, wiring assemblies and harnesses, cable management, electrical centers and hybrid high voltage and safety distribution systems. Our products provide the critical signal distribution and computing power backbone that supports increased vehicle content and electrification, reduced emissions and higher fuel economy.

•Advanced Safety and User Experience—This segment provides critical technologies, systems integration and advanced software development for vehicle safety, security, comfort and convenience, including sensing and perception systems, electronic control units, multi-domain controllers, vehicle connectivity systems, application software and autonomous driving technologies. Our products increase vehicle connectivity, reduce driver distraction and enhance vehicle safety.

Refer to Results of Operations by Segment in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 22. Segment Reporting to the audited consolidated financial statements for financial information about our business segments.

Our business is diversified across end-markets, regions, customers, vehicle platforms and products. Our customer base includes the 25 largest automotive OEMs in the world, and in 2021, 31% of our net sales came from the Asia Pacific region, which we have identified as a key market likely to experience substantial long-term growth. Our ten largest platforms in 2021 were with eight different OEMs. In addition, in 2021 our products were found in 19 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in the United States (“U.S.”), in 19 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in Europe and in 14 of the 20 top-selling vehicle models in China.

We have established a worldwide design and manufacturing footprint with a regional service model that enables us to efficiently and effectively serve our global customers from best cost countries. This regional model is structured primarily to service the North American market from Mexico, the South American market from Brazil, the European market from Eastern Europe and North Africa, and the Asia Pacific market from China. Our global scale and regional service model enables us to engineer globally and execute regionally to serve the largest OEMs, which are seeking suppliers that can serve them on a worldwide basis. Our footprint also enables us to adapt to the regional design variations the global OEMs require while also serving key growth market OEMs.

Our Industry

The automotive technology and components industry provides critical technologies, components, systems, subsystems and modules to OEMs for the manufacture of new vehicles, as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production and older vehicles. In addition, the industry is increasingly progressing towards software-defined vehicles becoming critical elements of the overall automotive ecosystem. Overall, we expect long-term growth of global vehicle sales and production in the OEM market. In 2021, the industry experienced a minimal increase in global production schedules which followed the unusually low 2020 production rates. The lack of significant growth in 2021 was primarily due to the impacts of global supply chain disruptions, including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage, and follows the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 which was driven by the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, 2021 global vehicle sales and production rates continue to be significantly below historic levels. Compared to the unusually low 2020 production rates, vehicle production in 2021 increased by 2% in China, 1% in North America and 18% in South America, our smallest region, and decreased by 4% in Europe. Demand for automotive components in the OEM market is generally a function of the number of new vehicles produced in response to consumer demand, which is primarily driven by macro-economic factors such as credit availability, interest rates, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment and other trends. Although OEM demand is tied to actual vehicle production, participants in the automotive technology and components industry also have the opportunity to grow through increasing product content per vehicle by further penetrating business with existing customers and in existing markets, gaining new customers and increasing their presence in global markets. We believe that evolving entrants into the global transportation industry such as mobility providers, electric vehicle developers and smart cities will provide additional markets for our advanced technologies. We believe that as a company with a global presence and advanced technology, engineering, manufacturing and customer support capabilities, we are well-positioned to benefit from these opportunities.

We believe that continuously increasing societal demands have created the three “mega-trends” that serve as the basis for the next wave of market-driven automotive technology advancement. We aim to continue developing leading edge technology focused on addressing these mega-trends, and apply that technology toward products with sustainable margins that enable our customers, both OEMs and others, to produce distinctive market-leading products. We have identified a core portfolio of products that draw on our technical strengths and align with these mega-trends where we believe we can provide differentiation to our customers.

Safe. The first mega-trend, “Safe,” represents technologies aimed not just at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, but those that actually proactively reduce the risk of a crash occurring. OEMs continue to focus on improving occupant and pedestrian safety in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. As a result, suppliers are focused on developing technologies aimed at protecting vehicle occupants when a crash occurs, as well as advanced driver assistance systems that reduce driver distractions and automated safety features that proactively mitigate the risk of a crash occurring. Examples of new and alternative technologies that 

5
incorporate sophisticated detection and advanced software for collision avoidance include lane departure warning systems, adaptive cruise control, gesture control and automatic braking.

Green. The second mega-trend, “Green,” represents technologies designed to help reduce emissions, increase fuel economy and minimize the environmental impact of vehicles. Green is a key mega-trend today because of the convergence of several issues: climate change, volatility in oil prices, an increasing number of vehicles in use worldwide and recent and pending regulation in every region regarding fuel economy and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. OEMs continue to focus on improving fuel efficiency and reducing emissions in order to meet increasingly stringent regulatory requirements in various markets. On a worldwide basis, the relevant authorities in the largest markets in which we operate have already instituted regulations requiring reductions in emissions and/or increased fuel economy. In many cases, other authorities have initiated legislation or regulation that would further tighten the standards through 2022 and beyond. Based on the current regulatory environment, we believe that OEMs, including those in the U.S. and China, will be subject to requirements for even greater reductions in carbon dioxide (“CO2”) emissions over the next ten years. For example, in the U.S., the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2021 finalized more stringent GHG emissions standards for passenger car and light trucks for model years 2023-2026. These and other standards will require meaningful innovation as OEMs and suppliers are challenged to find ways to improve engine management, electrical power consumption, vehicle weight and integration of alternative technologies (e.g., electric/hybrid propulsion). As a result, suppliers are developing innovations that result in significant improvements in fuel economy, emissions and performance from gasoline and diesel internal combustion engines. At the same time, suppliers are also developing and marketing new and alternative technologies that support hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles and fuel cell products to improve fuel economy and emissions. We are developing key enabling technologies in the areas of vehicle charging and vehicle power distribution and control that are essential to the introduction of our customers’ electrified vehicle platforms. We are also enabling the trend towards vehicle electrification with high voltage electrification solutions that reduce CO2 emissions and increase fuel economy, helping to make the world greener.

Connected. The third mega-trend, “Connected,” represents technologies designed to seamlessly integrate today’s highly complex vehicles into the electronic operating environment, and provide drivers with connectivity to the global information network. The technology content of vehicles continues to increase as consumers demand greater safety, personalization, infotainment, productivity and convenience while driving, which in turn leads to increasing demand for electrical architecture as a foundation for this content. Also with increased smart device usage in vehicles, driver distractions can be dramatically increased, which in turn results in greater risk of accidents. We are pioneering vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication technologies which enable vehicles to detect and signal danger, reducing vehicle collisions and improving driver safety, while also maintaining connectivity to an increasing number of devices inside and outside of vehicles. We also utilize advanced connectivity solutions such as over-the-air (OTA) technology that enable vehicles to receive software updates remotely and collect market-relevant data from connected vehicles.

We expect these mega-trends to continue to create growth and opportunity for us. We believe we are well-positioned to provide solutions and products to OEMs to expand the electronic and technological content of their vehicles. We also believe electronics integration, which generally refers to products and systems that combine integrated circuits, software algorithms, sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle will allow OEMs to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity, resulting in easier assembly, enhanced fuel economy, improved emissions control and better vehicle performance.

Convergence of Safe, Green and Connected Solutions in New Mobility and Autonomous Driving

The combination of advanced technologies being developed within these mega-trends is also contributing to increasing industry development of autonomous driving technologies, leading to a fully automated driving experience. We expect automated driving technologies will provide strong societal benefit as well as the opportunity for long-term growth for our product offerings in this space, including new potential customers such as mobility providers and smart cities that require solutions to increasing urban mobility challenges. Societal benefits of increased vehicle automation include enhanced safety (resulting from collision avoidance and improved vehicle control), environmental improvements (a reduction in CO2 emissions resulting from optimized driving behavior), labor cost savings and improved productivity (as a result of alternate uses for drive time). Growth opportunities in this space result from increased content, additional computing power and software requirements, enhanced connectivity systems and increased electrification and interconnects. We believe the complexity of these systems will also require ongoing software support services, as these vehicle systems will be continuously upgraded with new features and performance enhancements.

In an effort to harness the full potential of connected intelligent systems across industries, strengthen our capabilities in software-defined mobility and to enable advanced smart vehicle architecture changes, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wind River in January 2022. The transaction is expected to close in mid-2022, subject to regulatory approvals and 

6
customary closing conditions. Wind River is a global leader in delivering software for the intelligent edge. Previously, in 2021, we executed a strategic collaboration agreement with Wind River to develop a software toolchain for various automotive applications.

We are also continuing to invest in the automated driving space, and have continued to develop market-leading automated driving platform solutions such as automated driving software, key active safety sensing technologies and our multi-domain controller, which fuses information from sensing systems as well as mapping and navigation data to make driving decisions. We believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in this space, and have partnered with leaders in their respective fields to advance the pace of development and commercialization of these emerging technologies.

In March 2020, to further our leadership position in the automated driving space, we completed a transaction with Hyundai Motor Group (“Hyundai”) to form Motional, Inc. (“Motional”), a joint venture focused on the design, development and commercialization of autonomous driving technologies. Motional brings together one of the industry’s most innovative vehicle technology providers with one of the world’s largest OEMs. We expect this partnership to accelerate the path towards the development of production-ready autonomous driving systems for commercialization in the new mobility space.

We believe that substantial strategic value will be created from our partnership with Hyundai through our commitment to a shared mission of making driverless vehicles a safe, reliable and accessible reality. Furthermore, we anticipate Motional’s presence in both North America and Asia, along with the global presence of both Aptiv and Hyundai, to generate economies of scale to support the development of a complete autonomous driving platform, as well as to facilitate mobility infrastructure advancements.

Motional began testing fully driverless systems in 2020 and anticipates it will have a production-ready autonomous driving platform available for robotaxi providers, meal delivery providers, fleet operators and automotive manufacturers to test at prototype scale in 2022, with higher volumes available for deployment in 2023. In addition, Motional is involved in collaborative arrangements with mobility providers and with smart cities such as Boston, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Singapore as solutions are developed for the evolving nature of the mobility industry. As a result of our substantial investments and strategic partnerships, we believe we are well-aligned with industry technology trends that will result in sustainable future growth in these evolving areas.

To guide our product strategies and investments in technology with a focus on developing advanced technologies to drive growth within the Safe, Green and Connected mega-trends, we utilize and benefit from our Technology Advisory Council, a panel of prominent global technology thought leaders.

Standardization of Sourcing by OEMs

Many OEMs have adopted global vehicle platforms to increase standardization, reduce per unit cost and increase capital efficiency and profitability. As a result, OEMs select suppliers that have the capability to manufacture products on a worldwide basis as well as the flexibility to adapt to regional variations. Suppliers with global scale and strong design, engineering and manufacturing capabilities, are best positioned to benefit from this trend. OEMs are also increasingly looking to their suppliers to simplify vehicle design and assembly processes to reduce costs. As a result, suppliers that sell vehicle components directly to manufacturers (Tier I suppliers) have assumed many of the design, engineering, research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vehicle manufacturers. Suppliers that can provide fully-engineered solutions, systems and pre-assembled combinations of component parts are positioned to leverage the trend toward system sourcing.

Shorter Product Development Cycles

As a result of government regulations and customer preferences, OEMs are requiring suppliers to respond faster with new designs and product innovations. While these trends are more prevalent in mature markets, certain key growth markets are advancing rapidly towards the regulatory standards and consumer preferences of the more mature markets. Suppliers with strong technologies, robust global engineering and development capabilities will be best positioned to meet OEM demands for rapid innovation.

Competition

Although the overall number of our top competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive. Furthermore, the rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, particularly in best cost countries such as China and in areas of evolving vehicle technologies such as intelligent systems software, automated driving and mobility solutions, which has attracted competitors from outside the traditional automotive industry. OEMs rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality, price, reliability and timeliness of delivery, product design capability, technical expertise and development capability, new product innovation, financial viability, application of lean principles, operational flexibility, customer service and overall management. In addition, our customers generally require that we demonstrate improved efficiencies, through cost reductions and/or price improvement, on a year-over-year basis.

Our competitors in each of our operating segments are as follows:

Customers

We sell our products and services to the major global OEMs in every region of the world. The following table provides the percentage of net sales to our largest customers for the year ended December 31, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)On January 16, 2021, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (“FCA”) and PSA Peugeot Citroën (“PSA”) PSA executed a merger agreement to form a new, combined company, Stellantis. Net sales to FCA and PSA before the date of the merger are included in net sales to Stellantis in the table above for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Supply Relationships with Our Customers

We typically supply products to our OEM customers through purchase orders, which are generally governed by general terms and conditions established by each OEM. Although the terms and conditions vary from customer to customer, they typically contemplate a relationship under which our customers place orders for their requirements of specific components supplied for particular vehicles but are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. These relationships typically extend over the life of the related vehicle. Prices are negotiated with respect to each business award, which may be subject to adjustments under certain circumstances, such as commodity or foreign exchange escalation/de-escalation clauses or for cost reductions achieved by us. The terms and conditions typically provide that we are subject to a warranty on the products supplied; in most cases, the duration of such warranty is coterminous with the warranty offered by the OEM to the end-user of the vehicle. We may also be obligated to share in all or a part of recall costs if the OEM recalls its vehicles for defects attributable to our products.

Individual purchase orders are terminable for cause or non-performance and, in most cases, upon our insolvency and certain change of control events. In addition, many of our OEM customers have the option to terminate for convenience on certain programs, which permits our customers to impose pressure on pricing during the life of the vehicle program, and issue purchase contracts for less than the duration of the vehicle program, which potentially reduces our profit margins and increases the risk of our losing future sales under those purchase contracts. Additionally, one of our largest customers, GM, expressly reserves a right to terminate for competitiveness on certain of our long-term supply contracts. We manufacture and ship based on customer release schedules, normally provided on a weekly basis, which can vary due to cyclical automobile production or dealer inventory levels.

Although customer programs typically extend to future periods, and although there is an expectation that we will supply certain levels of OEM production during such future periods, customer agreements including applicable terms and conditions do not necessarily constitute firm orders. Firm orders are generally limited to specific and authorized customer purchase order releases placed with our manufacturing and distribution centers for actual production and order fulfillment. Firm orders are typically fulfilled as promptly as possible from the conversion of available raw materials, sub-components and work-in-process inventory for OEM orders and from current on-hand finished goods inventory for aftermarket orders. The dollar amount of such purchase order releases on hand and not processed at any point in time is not believed to be significant based upon the time frame involved.

Materials

We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. Generally, we seek to obtain materials in the region in which our products are manufactured in order to minimize transportation and other costs. The most significant raw materials we use to manufacture our products include copper and resins. As of December 31, 2021, we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials, however, as a result of our customers’ recent production volatility and cancellations, our balance of productive, raw and component material inventories has increased substantially from customary levels. These 

9
changes to the production environment have been primarily driven by the worldwide semiconductor shortage. We continue to actively monitor and manage inventory levels across all inventory types in order to maximize both supply continuity and the efficient use of working capital. Normally we do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules. 

Commodity cost volatility, most notably related to copper, petroleum-based resin products and fuel, is a challenge for us and our industry. For instance in 2021, the industry has been subjected to increased pricing pressures, specifically in relation to these commodities, which have increased significantly in price at times during the year. We are continually seeking to manage these and other material-related cost pressures using a combination of strategies, including working with our suppliers to mitigate costs, seeking alternative product designs and material specifications, combining our purchase requirements with our customers and/or suppliers, changing suppliers, hedging of certain commodities and other means. In the case of copper, which primarily affects our Signal and Power Solutions segment, contract clauses have enabled us to pass on some of the price increases to our customers and thereby partially offset the impact of increased commodity costs on operating income for the related products. However, other than in the case of copper, our overall success in passing commodity cost increases on to our customers has been limited. We will continue our efforts to pass market-driven commodity cost increases to our customers in an effort to mitigate all or some of the adverse earnings impacts, including by seeking to renegotiate terms as contracts with our customers expire.

Seasonality

In general, our business is moderately seasonal, as our primary North American customers historically reduce production during the month of July and halt operations for approximately one week in December. Our European customers generally reduce production during the months of July and August and for one week in December. Shut-down periods in the rest of the world generally vary by country. In addition, automotive production is traditionally reduced in the months of July, August and September due to the launch of component production for new vehicle models.

Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 155,000 people; 27,000 salaried employees and 128,000 hourly employees. In addition, we maintain a contingent workforce of 36,000 to accommodate fluctuations in customer demand. We are a global company serving every major market worldwide, and our workforce as of December 31, 2021 is regionally aligned as follows:

•53% in North America, with our largest presence in Mexico;

•33% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, with our largest presence in Morocco and Serbia;

•10% in the Asia Pacific region, with our largest presence in China; and

•4% in South America, with our largest presence in Brazil.

Certain of our employees are represented worldwide by numerous unions and works councils, including the International Union of Electronic, Electrical, Salaried, Machine and Furniture Workers - Communications Workers of America and the Confederacion De Trabajadores Mexicanos. We maintain collaborative and constructive labor relationships with our employee representatives in order to foster positive employee relations.

Our culture embodies distinct values and behaviors that unite Aptiv’s diverse workforce and inform how we select, promote and reward our people. Together, we thrive in a culture of innovation and execution. We see our business culture as a distinct advantage and look to magnify its strengths to drive operational performance and employee engagement. Our culture and values complement our purpose and strategy by ensuring that we remain focused and diligent in delivering on our highest priority goals. Through various manager and employee surveys, forums and targeted workshops, we continue to gather employee feedback that enables us to implement what we believe are the right actions to advance our culture and values.

Diversity and Inclusion

At Aptiv, we value each individual’s perspective and foster a strong culture of respect and inclusive collaboration. Leveraging our employees’ diverse backgrounds and experiences allows us to make better decisions and supports stronger operating performance. Our Board of Directors reviews Aptiv’s talent evolution, inclusion and diversity efforts annually, and our Compensation & Human Resources Committee reviews employee retention, attrition and pay equity on an ongoing basis.

Aptiv also participates in, and sponsors, numerous outreach programs around the world, which seek to promote and recruit women and diversity candidates into science, technology, engineering and math fields. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of our global workforce represented by females was approximately 50% and the percentage of management represented by females was 24%. As of December 31, 2021, the percentage of our U.S. based workforce represented by minorities was approximately 40% and the percentage of U.S. based management represented by minorities was approximately 24%. Aptiv is committed to continuing to increase its level of diversity, specifically in middle management, senior leadership and technology roles over the coming years.

Health and Safety

We prioritize the health and safety of all our employees. We routinely assess occupational health and safety risks, including internal audits for all manufacturing sites, assessing, among other things, lost workday case rates, safety incident rates, safety habits training and number of training hours per employee. We are a leader in workplace safety as reflected in our lost time injury frequency rate of 0.129 cases per million hours worked for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 0.132 for the prior year. In addition, our lost workday case rate per 100 employees was 0.027 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Furthermore, we are committed to ensuring all of our manufacturing sites are ISO 45001 certified by 2025.

Many of the safety protocol responses we implemented as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic remained in place in 2021 and are designed to make all of Aptiv’s sites safer, including extensive cleaning of our facilities, enhanced communications about safety protocols and building capacity limits, as well as daily health screenings for on-site employees and mandatory mask use when indoors as determined on a site-by-site basis.

Commitment to Environmental Sustainability

Sustainability has always been core to Aptiv’s business, values and culture. We believe this strong, foundational focus on sustainability makes Aptiv a partner of choice for our customers, a desirable place to work for our employees and a valued contributor to the communities in which we operate. While a key part of our business is to design solutions that help transition the world’s vehicles to cleaner sources of power, we are also committed to reducing our environmental footprint throughout our operations around the globe. We aim to reduce our environmental footprint by decreasing our carbon footprint, reducing waste generated and consuming less water in our operations. Expenditures required to meet our environmental sustainability goals, which are described below, are included in our normal budgeting process.

Decreasing our Carbon Footprint

In 2021, we committed to becoming carbon-neutral in our global operations by 2030 and to achieve net carbon neutrality by 2040 as we transition away from carbon-intensive energy and processes in our global operations. To achieve these commitments, we are targeting:

•Reducing Scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by 25% by 2025;

•Maintaining annual certification of all major manufacturing sites to the ISO 14001 standard;

•Certifying ten of the most energy-intensive sites to the ISO 50001 certification by 2025;

•Sourcing 100% of electricity for operations from renewable sources by 2030; and

11
•Delivering only carbon-neutral products by 2039, from sourcing to disposal.

Key to achieving these goals is our global Environmental, Health and Safety and Sustainability management system, which helps to keep us aligned with stringent environmental, health and safety regulations and provides a structure for continuous improvement. This system applies to all Aptiv sites, which means that in some countries our procedures go beyond local regulations and requirements. This system is continuously updated to ensure that our procedures remain up to date.

Reducing our Water Usage and Waste Generated

While our operations are not water intensive, we include water in our environmental risk management approach. We identify locations where we operate that are water-scarce and take action to reduce our water consumption accordingly, while also striving to comply with best practices in lower-risk locations. Our goal is to reduce water consumption in high-risk (water-scarce) locations by 2% per year.

We are also committed to reducing waste, with a waste recycled target (volume of recycled waste divided by total waste volume) of 80%. We continue to strive to actively reduce and manage waste across our manufacturing operations, as well as in our offices. We are creating packaging that uses less material and we continue to strive to increase the share of waste and excess materials we divert to recycling.

Additional information regarding our environmental sustainability and human capital initiatives is available in our annual Sustainability Report located on our website at www.aptiv.com/about/sustainability. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned Sustainability Report, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

Environmental Compliance

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S., environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These include laws regulating air emissions, water discharge, climate change, hazardous materials and waste management. We have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally. Although it is our intent to comply with all such laws and regulations, we cannot provide assurance that we are at all times in compliance. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. Accordingly, we cannot ensure that environmental laws and regulations will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental costs and liabilities will not be material.

Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances. In addition to clean-up actions brought by U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. agencies, plaintiffs could raise personal injury or other private claims due to the presence of hazardous substances on or from a property. At this time, we are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at certain of our present and former facilities. In addition, there may be soil or groundwater contamination at several of our properties resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities.

At December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the undiscounted reserve for environmental investigation and remediation was approximately $4 million, $4 million and $4 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that our eventual environmental remediation costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves. In the event that such liabilities were to significantly exceed the amounts recorded, our results of operations could be materially affected.
