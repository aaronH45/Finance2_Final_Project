PART I

​

Item 1.Business.

​

We are a leading provider of tech-forward payment and lending solutions, serving customers and consumer-based industries in North America. Through omnichannel touch points and a comprehensive product suite that includes credit card products and Bread® digital payment solutions, we help our partners drive revenue growth and customer loyalty, while giving customers greater payment choices. We also offer credit and savings products directly to consumers through our proprietary products, including our Comenity-branded financial services.

​

Our partner base of more than 600 companies and online merchants consists of large consumer-based businesses, including well-known brands such as Victoria’s Secret, Signet, Ulta, Toyota, Petco and Big Lots, as well as small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). Our partner base is diversified across a broad range of verticals, including sports, beauty, jewelry, home goods and hospitality. We believe our comprehensive suite of payment, lending and saving solutions, along with our related marketing and data & analytics, offers us a significant competitive advantage with products relevant across customer segments (Gen Z, Millennial, Gen X). The breadth and quality of our service offerings have enabled us to establish and maintain long-standing partner relationships.

​

On November 5, 2021, we completed the spinoff of our LoyaltyOne® segment, consisting of the Canadian AIR MILES® Reward Program and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty businesses, into an independent, publicly traded company. The entity we created to hold these businesses, Loyalty Ventures Inc., is now listed on Nasdaq under the symbol “LYLT.” The spinoff was completed through the pro rata distribution of 81% of the outstanding shares of Loyalty Ventures Inc. common stock to holders of our common stock at the close of business on the record date of October 27, 2021, with Alliance Data retaining the remaining 19% of the outstanding shares of Loyalty Ventures Inc. common stock. Our stockholders of record received one share of Loyalty Ventures Inc. common stock for every two and one-half shares of Alliance Data common stock held on the record date. 

​

Unless otherwise noted, all discussion below, including amounts and percentages for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial condition of Alliance Data’s continuing operations. As such, the LoyaltyOne segment, which was classified as discontinued operations as of November 5, 2021, has been excluded. Prior to the spinoff of the LoyaltyOne segment, we had two reportable operating segments (Card Services and LoyaltyOne). We now operate as a single segment that includes all of our continuing operations. 

​

Business Strategy

​

Beginning in 2018, our Board of Directors undertook a series of strategic initiatives based on an evaluation of the portfolio of businesses that constituted our company. Subsequently, we completed the sale of Epsilon in July 2019, the sale of our Precima® business (which was part of the LoyaltyOne segment) in January 2020, and the spinoff of our LoyaltyOne segment in November 2021. Through these transactions and other initiatives, we have simplified our business model as a leading provider of tech-forward payment and lending solutions, while also reducing debt and improving leverage and capital ratios. As we have transformed the business, we have made strategic investments in assets with the highest growth potential, focused on expanding our product suite, diversifying our customer base, developing key strategic relationships, enhancing our core technology, and modernizing and advancing our digital capabilities. 

​

We continue to make strategic investments in technology, people, data management tools and digital capabilities to further improve our competitive position and drive future growth. These investments further our objective to grow sales through the origination of credit card and other loans, making it easier for consumers to finance purchases and make payments wherever they occur— online, in store and in-app. By offering consumer choice, we provide relevant products across consumer segments, including Gen Z and Millennials who are attracted to cash flow management products such as split-pay and installment lending, while Gen X and Baby Boomers gravitate towards rewards and the convenience of a private label or co-brand card. With our broad suite of products, including private label and co-brand credit cards, buy now, pay later (BNPL) options (installment loans and split-pay), together with digital, analytical and servicing capabilities to support those products, we drive incremental sales for our partners’ businesses. We also intend to continue rebalancing our portfolio, prioritizing and investing in profitable, strong performing partners, targeting core and new verticals, improving our cost base and becoming a more cost-efficient provider of financial products and services. In addition, we continue to expand our direct-to-consumer lending and payment products for new and existing customers, 

2 
including debt consolidation products and proprietary credit cards for growth and value retention. Through our digital payments business, which operates under the trademark Bread, we offer an omnichannel solution for retailers and merchants and platform capabilities to bank partners. Bread’s offerings and on-boarding capabilities enhance the growth prospects of our verticals and increase the addressable market of SMB. Bread also offers our existing co-brand and private label credit card partners a broader digital product suite and additional white-label product solutions.

​

Products and Services

​

We assist some of the best-known brands and retailers in driving sales and loyalty through an expanding suite of lending and payment solutions, including private label and co-brand credit card programs, and BNPL options (installment lending and split-pay). Our partners benefit from customer insights and analytics, with each of our credit card branded programs tailored to our partner’s brand and their unique customers. In addition, we continue to expand our direct-to-consumer lending and payment products and our digital payments platform. These products are supported and maximized by our digital, analytical and servicing capabilities. Our products and services are discussed in more detail below under the headings (i) credit card and other loans financing, (ii) loan processing and servicing, (iii) marketing and data & analytics and (iv) digital offerings.

​

Credit Card and Other Loans Financing. We provide risk management solutions, account origination and funding services for approximately 130 private label and co-brand credit card programs, as well as through Bread partnerships, with over 500 SMB merchants. In 2020, we launched our Comenity-branded general purpose cash-back credit card, an important new product for us to serve and retain our cardholders and capture incremental spend. As of December 31, 2021, we had $16.6 billion in principal loans from approximately 36 million active accounts, with an average balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 of approximately $828 for accounts with outstanding balances. 

​

We process millions of credit card applications each year using automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make responsible risk-based origination decisions when approving new accounts and establishing credit limits. Credit quality is monitored on a regular and consistent basis, utilizing internal algorithms and external credit bureau risk scores. This information helps us segment prospects into narrower risk ranges, allowing us to better evaluate individual credit risk.

​

Loan Processing and Servicing. We manage and service the loans we originate for private label, co-brand and general purpose credit card programs and Bread BNPL (installment loans, split-pay) products. In 2022, we expect to complete the transition of our credit card processing services to Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions. With the migration of our core processing to Fiserv, we expect to improve our speed to market, including the ability to quickly and seamlessly add new products and capabilities that benefit our partners and cardholders. The platform enables efficient integration of digital technology, while supporting our data and analytics capabilities and improving operational efficiencies.

​

Our customer care operations are influenced by our retail heritage and we view every customer touch point as an opportunity to provide an exceptional experience. Our customer care operations offer omnichannel servicing, including phone, mail, fax, email, text and web. We provide focused training programs in all areas to achieve the highest possible customer service standards and monitor our performance by conducting surveys with our partners and our customers. In 2021, for the sixteenth time since 2003, we were certified as a Center of Excellence for the quality of our operations, the most prestigious ranking attainable, by BenchmarkPortal. Founded by Purdue University in 1995, BenchmarkPortal is a global leader of best practices for customer care centers. 

​

Marketing and Data & Analytics. Through our integrated marketing services, we design and implement strategies that assist our partners in acquiring, retaining and expanding customer engagement to drive a more loyal, frequent shopper that increases customer lifetime value. Our programs capture transaction data that we analyze to better understand consumer behavior and use to increase the effectiveness of our partners’ marketing activities. Through our data and analytics capabilities, including machine learning and artificial intelligence, we focus on data insights that drive actionable strategies and enhance revenue growth and customer retention. We use multi-channel marketing communication tools, including in-store, web, permission-based email, permission-based mobile messaging and direct mail to engage customers in the channel of their choice.

 ​

​

3 
Digital Offerings. Through our Enhanced Digital Suite, a group of marketing and credit application features, we help our brand partners capitalize on online trends, by bringing through more qualified applicants, a higher average purchase value, and a higher credit sales conversion rate. Enhanced Digital Suite includes a unified software development kit (SDK) that provides access to our broad suite of products, and promotes relevant credit payment options earlier in the shopping experience. The application is simple and easy, offers prefilled fields and pre-screens customers in real-time, allowing for immediate credit approval without leaving the brand partner’s site.

​

Through Bread, our digital payments business acquired in 2020, we offer a flexible platform and robust suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow merchants and partners to seamlessly integrate online point-of-sale financing and other digital payment products, including installment and split-pay solutions. These digital payment offerings and on-boarding capabilities enhance the growth prospects of our verticals and increase the addressable market of SMB. At the same time, we can now offer our existing partners a broader digital product suite and additional white-label product solutions. As our Bread business has grown, it has expanded our ability to leverage our digital offerings to build both strategic technology platform partnerships and more traditional brand partnership sales and loans.

​

For additional information relating to our business, business strategy and products and services, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Year in Review – Business Environment.”

​

Disaster and Contingency Planning

​

We operate, either internally or through third-party service providers, multiple data processing centers to process and store our customer transaction data. Given the significant amount of data that we or our third-party service providers manage, much of which is real-time data to support our partners’ commerce initiatives, we have established redundant capabilities for our data centers. We have a number of safeguards in place that are designed to protect us from data-related risks and in the event of a disaster, to restore our data centers’ systems. For additional information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risk Management – Operational Risk.”

​

Protection of Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights

​

We rely on a combination of patents, copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and technology used in our business. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks primarily in the United States, although we also have either registered trademarks or applications pending for certain marks in other countries. No individual patent or license is material to us or our business.

​

Competition

​

The markets for our products and services are highly competitive, continuously changing, highly innovative, and subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete with a wide range of businesses, including financial institutions, fintechs and payment networks. Some of our current and potential competitors may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, broader geographic scope, volume, scale, resources, and market share than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Other competitors are smaller or younger companies that may be more agile in responding quickly to regulatory and technological changes. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with innovative and disruptive technologies, emerging competitors, business alliances, shifting consumer habits and user needs, price sensitivity on the part of merchants and consumers, and frequent introductions of new products and services.

​

In competing to acquire and retain the business of brand partners, our primary competition is with other financial institutions whose marketing focus has been on developing credit card programs with large revolving balances. These competitors further drive their businesses by cross-selling their other financial products to their cardholders. We also compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting 

4 
standards, marketing expertise, service levels, the breadth of our product and service offerings, digital, technological and integration capabilities, brand recognition and reputation. Our focus is on retailers and other brand partners that understand the competitive advantage of developing loyal customers. As a result, we focus on analyzing transaction data we obtain through partner loyalty programs and managing our lending programs, including customer specific transaction data and overall consumer spending patterns, to develop and implement successful marketing strategies for our partners. The consumer credit and payments industry is highly competitive and we face an increasingly dynamic industry as emerging technologies enter the marketplace. As a form of payment, our products compete with cash, checks, electronic bank transfers, debit cards, general purpose credit cards (including Visa and MasterCard, American Express and Discover Card), various forms of consumer installment loans and split-pay products, other private label card brands, prepaid cards, digital wallets and mobile payment solutions, and other tools that simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers and merchants. As the payments industry continues to evolve, in the future we expect increasing competition with emerging payment technologies from financial technology firms and payment networks. Moreover, some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.

​

Supervision and Regulation

​

We operate primarily through our insured depository institution subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, which together are referred to herein as the “Banks.” Federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of the Banks. This regulatory framework is intended to protect individual consumers, depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the U.S. banking system as a whole rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. Set forth below is a summary of the significant laws and regulations applicable to each of Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. The description that follows is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, and policies that are described. Such statutes, regulations, and policies are subject to ongoing review by Congress, state legislatures, and federal and state regulatory agencies. A change in any of the statutes, regulations, or regulatory policies applicable to Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, or in the leadership or direction of our regulators, could have a material effect on the results of Alliance Data. Further, the scope of regulation and the intensity of supervision will likely remain higher under the Biden Administration.

​

Comenity Bank is a Delaware-chartered bank operating as a credit card bank under Competitive Equality Banking Act (CEBA) exemptions in the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act). To maintain its status as a CEBA credit card bank, Comenity Bank must continue to comply with the following requirements:

​

●engage only in credit card operations;

●do not accept demand deposits or deposits that the depositor may withdraw by check or similar means for payment to third parties;

●do not accept any savings or time deposits of less than $100,000, except for deposits pledged as collateral for its extensions of credit;

●maintain only one office that accepts deposits; and

●do not engage in the business of making commercial loans (except small business loans).

​

Comenity Bank is subject to prudential regulation, supervision and examination by the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, as its chartering authority, and the FDIC as its primary federal regulator. Comenity Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with applicable law and FDIC regulations. Comenity Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.

 ​

Comenity Capital Bank is a Utah-chartered industrial bank. As an industrial bank, Comenity Capital Bank is exempt from the definition of “bank” under the BHC Act. Comenity Capital Bank is subject to prudential regulation, supervision and examination by the Utah Department of Financial Institutions, as its chartering authority, and the FDIC as its primary federal regulator. Comenity Capital Bank’s deposits are insured by the DIF of the FDIC up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with applicable law and FDIC regulations. Comenity Capital Bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System.

​

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) promulgates regulations for the federal consumer financial protection laws. Banks in a multi-bank organization, such Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, are subject to 

5 
supervision and examination by the CFPB with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws if at least one bank reports total assets over $10 billion for four consecutive quarters. While Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank were previously subject to such supervision and examination by the CFPB, neither have reported total assets over $10 billion for the last consecutive four quarters and both are now subject to supervision and examination with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws by the FDIC. If and when either Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank report total assets over $10 billion for four consecutive quarters, such supervision and examination will revert back to the CFPB.

​

Regulation of Alliance Data

​

Because neither Comenity Bank nor Comenity Capital Bank is considered a “bank” within the meaning of the BHC Act, Alliance Data is not a bank holding company subject to regulation thereunder. If any of our entities became subject to regulation as a bank holding company, among other things, Alliance Data and its nonbank subsidiaries would be subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) and our operations would be limited to certain activities that are closely related to banking or financial services in nature. 

​

Regulation of the Banks

​

Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank’s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, the loans a bank makes and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and acquisitions, management practices, and numerous other aspects of banking operations.

​

Source of Strength Doctrine

​

Under Section 616 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act), any company that directly or indirectly controls an insured depository institution is required to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary institution and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. This doctrine is commonly known as the "source of strength" doctrine. As such a company, this means that Alliance Data must stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to the Banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting the Banks. This support may be required at times when Alliance Data might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Alliance Data or its stockholders or creditors. Alliance Data’s failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to the Banks would generally be considered to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice.

​

Regulatory Capital Requirements

​

The Banks are subject to certain risk-based capital and leverage ratio requirements under the U.S. Basel III capital rules adopted by the FDIC. These rules implement the Basel III international regulatory capital standards in the United States, as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. These quantitative calculations are minimums, and the FDIC may determine that a bank, based on its size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. 

​

Under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, the Banks’ assets, exposures, and certain off-balance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions’ risk-weighted assets, which then are used to determine the minimum capital that the Banks should keep as a reserve to reduce the risk of insolvency. These risk-weighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for the Banks:

●Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Risk-Based Capital Ratio, which is the ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets. CET1 capital primarily includes common stockholders’ equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions, including goodwill, intangible assets, certain deferred tax assets, and AOCI.

●Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio, which is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is primarily comprised of CET1 capital, perpetual preferred stock, and certain qualifying capital instruments.

6 
●Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio, which is the ratio of total capital, including CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, and Tier 2 capital, to risk-weighted assets. Tier 2 capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying Allowance for credit losses.

●Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets (net of goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and certain other deductions).

​

Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. Failure to be well-capitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the Banks’ ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications.

​

The U.S. Basel III capital rules require a minimum CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.0%, and a minimum Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0%. In addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements, under the U.S. Basel III capital rules, the Banks must also maintain the required 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. The Capital Conservation Buffer is calculated as a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets, and it effectively increases the required minimum risk-based capital ratios. As a result, the Banks must maintain a CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 7%, a Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 8.5% and a Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of at least 10.5% to avoid being subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to its executive management. The Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is not impacted by the Capital Conservation Buffer, and a bank may be considered well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the Capital Conservation Buffer. The required minimum Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for all banks and bank holding companies is 4%.

​

To be well-capitalized, the Banks must maintain the following capital ratios:

●CET1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 6.5% or greater;

●Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 8.0% or greater;

●Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio of 10.0% or greater; and 

●Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of 5.0% or greater.

​

At December 31, 2021, the Banks’ regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met the Capital Conservation Buffer. The Banks seek to maintain capital levels and ratios in excess of the minimum regulatory requirements inclusive of the 2.5% Capital Conservation Buffer.

​

Dividends

​

Alliance Data is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Banks. Declaration and payment of cash dividends depends upon cash dividend payments to Alliance Data by the Banks, which are our primary source of revenue and cash flow. As state-chartered banks, the Banks are subject to regulatory restrictions on the payment and amounts of dividends under Delaware or Utah law, as applicable. Further, the ability of the Banks to pay dividends to Alliance Data is also subject to their profitability, financial condition, capital expenditures and other cash flow requirements, and any such dividends are also subject to the approval of the Board of Directors of the applicable Bank.

​

The payment of dividends by the Banks and Alliance Data may also be affected by other factors, such as the requirement to maintain adequate capital above regulatory requirements. The federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a bank’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. A bank may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. Moreover, the federal banking agencies have issued policy statements that provide that banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The federal banking agencies have the authority to prohibit banks from paying a dividend if it is deemed such payment would be an unsafe or unsound practice.

​

Prompt Corrective Action and Safety and Soundness

​

Under applicable "prompt corrective action" ("PCA") statutes and regulations, insured depository institutions, such as the Banks, are placed into one of five capital categories, ranging from "well capitalized" to "critically 

7 
undercapitalized." The PCA statute and regulations provide for progressively more stringent supervisory measures as an institution’s capital category declines. An institution that is not well capitalized is generally prohibited from accepting brokered deposits and offering interest rates on deposits higher than the prevailing rate in its market. An undercapitalized institution must submit an acceptable restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency. One requisite element of such a plan is that the institution’s parent holding company guarantee the institution’s compliance with the plan, subject to certain limitations. At December 31, 2021, the Banks qualified as "well capitalized" under applicable regulatory capital standards. 

​

Insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business, or for violation of any law, rule, regulation, condition imposed in writing by the agency, or term of a written agreement with the agency. In more serious cases, enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the imposition of civil monetary penalties; the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced; the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers, directors, and other institution affiliated parties; the termination of the institution’s deposit insurance; the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution; and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the FDIC, as receiver, would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted.

​

Reserve Requirements

​

Federal Reserve Board regulations require insured depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts, primarily interest-bearing and regular checking accounts. The required cash reserves can be in the form of vault cash and, if vault cash does not fully satisfy the required cash reserves, in the form of a balance maintained with Federal Reserve Banks. The regulations require that the Banks maintain cash reserves against aggregate transaction accounts in excess of the exempt amount. The Federal Reserve Board generally makes annual adjustments to the tiered cash reserve requirements; however, effective March 26, 2020, the reserve requirement was reset to zero to address liquidity concerns due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and maintained at zero effective March 2021 and March 2022. The reserve requirement remains subject to annual adjustment as conditions warrant.

​

Restrictions on Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders

​

Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other covered transactions with either of the Banks, which may have the effect of limiting the extent to which either Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us. “Covered transactions” include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright bar on engaging in covered transactions, they do require that we engage in “covered transactions” with either Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by either Bank to us or our other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral.

​

The Banks are also subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, and the implementing Regulation O as applied to the Banks. These provisions impose limitations on loans and extensions of credit by the Banks to their executive officers, directors and principal shareholders and their related interests, as well as those of the Banks’ affiliates. The limitations restrict the terms and aggregate amount of such transactions. Regulation O also imposes certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Restrictions on transactions with affiliates and insiders under Federal Reserve Act Sections 23A, 23B, 22(g) and 22(h), as well as the requirements of Regulation O, are monitored for compliance by our internal audit department. 

​

Federal Deposit Insurance 

​

The deposits of the Banks are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF of the FDIC. The standard maximum deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, per insured depository institution, per ownership category, in accordance with applicable FDIC regulations.

​

8 
The FDIC uses a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based on a risk matrix that takes into account an institution’s capital level and supervisory rating. The base for insurance assessments is the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of an institution. Assessment rates are calculated using formulas that take into account the risk of the institution being assessed.

​

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDIA), the FDIC may terminate an institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe and unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. 

​

Depositor Preference

​

The FDIA provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including the parent company or otherwise bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.

​

Volcker Rule

​

Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, commonly known as the Volcker Rule, restricts the ability of banking entities, such as Alliance Data and the Banks, from: (i) engaging in proprietary trading and (ii) investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds, subject to certain limited exceptions. Under the Volcker Rule, the term covered funds is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act but for the exemption in section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act, which includes collateralized loan obligation securities (CLO) and collateralized debt obligation securities. There are also several exemptions from the definition of covered funds, including, among other things, loan securitization, joint ventures, certain types of foreign funds, entities issuing asset-backed commercial paper, and registered investment companies. We do not engage in these restricted activities, including in proprietary trading.

​

Incentive Compensation

​

The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal banking agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities, including the Banks, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. The federal banking agencies and the SEC most recently proposed such regulations in 2016, but the regulations have not yet been finalized. If the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed, the manner in which executive compensation is structured will be restricted.

​

The Dodd-Frank Act also requires publicly traded companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the date of enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called "golden parachute" payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions.

​

USA PATRIOT Act

​

Under Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers, prevent money laundering, monitor customer transactions, and report suspicious activity to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies. Information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and other privacy laws. Financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities, including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns, and are prohibited from dealing with foreign "shell banks" and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern. The primary federal banking agencies and the Secretary of the Treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions. All financial institutions also are required to establish internal anti-money laundering programs. The effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any 

9 
application submitted by the financial institution under the Bank Merger Act. The Banks have in place a Bank Secrecy Act and USA PATRIOT Act compliance program and engage in very few transactions of any kind with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons.

​

Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations

​

The United States government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals, and others. These are typically known as the "OFAC" rules based on their administration by the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control. The Office of Foreign Assets Control-administered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms. Generally, OFAC sanctions contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on U.S. persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in, or providing investment-related advice or assistance to, a sanctioned country; and (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons). Blocked assets (property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off, or transferred in any manner without a license from the Office of Foreign Assets Control. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.

​

Identity Theft

​

The SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jointly issued final rules and guidelines implementing the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft. The rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy these requirements. In addition, the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC or the CFTC to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances. The Banks implemented an ID Theft Prevention Program, approved by their Boards of Directors, in compliance with these requirements.

​

Community Reinvestment Act

​

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound business practices. The relevant federal banking agency, the FDIC in the Banks’ case, examines each bank and assigns it a public CRA rating. A bank’s record of fair lending compliance is part of the resulting CRA examination report. CRA performance evaluations are based on a four-tiered rating system: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve and Substantial Noncompliance. CRA performance evaluations are considered in evaluating applications for such things as mergers, acquisitions and applications to open branches. The Banks each received a CRA rating of "Outstanding" at their most recent CRA examinations.

​

Consumer Protection Regulation and Supervision

​

We currently are subject to regulation by the FDIC with respect to the federal consumer protection laws. We are also subject to certain state consumer protection laws and state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations. State authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules. These federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates, fair lending, disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers, debt collection practices, the use and provision of information to consumer reporting agencies, and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer, sale, or provision of consumer financial products and services.

Privacy and Data Protection Regulation

​

Data protection and consumer privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve, increasing restrictions on our ability to collect and disseminate customer information. In addition, the enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer, public or private sector privacy issues may impact our marketing services, including placing restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available. There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection, sharing and use of certain types of consumer data primarily in connection with financial services transactions that are relevant to our various businesses and services. In the United States, federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, as well as similar and applicable state laws, make it more difficult to collect, share and use information that has previously been legally available and may increase our costs of collecting some data. These laws give bank customers, including cardholders and depositors, the ability to “opt out” of having certain information generated by their applicable financial services transactions shared with other affiliated and unaffiliated parties or the public. Our ability to gather, share and utilize this data will be adversely affected if a significant percentage of the consumers whose purchasing behavior we track elect to “opt out,” thereby precluding us and our affiliates from using their data.

​

The federal Do-Not-Call Implementation Act makes it more difficult to telephonically communicate with prospective and existing customers. The regulations give consumers the ability to “opt out,” through a national do-not-call registry and state do-not-call registries, of having telephone solicitations placed to them by companies that do not have an existing business relationship with the consumer. In addition, regulations require companies to maintain an internal do-not-call list for those who do not want the companies to solicit them through telemarketing. These regulations could limit our ability to provide services and information to our partners. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties. Further, the Federal Communications Commission has approved interpretations of rules related to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act defining robo-calls broadly, which may affect our ability to contact customers and may increase our litigation exposure.

​

The federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 restricts our ability to send commercial electronic mail messages, the primary purpose of which is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service, to our customers and prospective customers. The act requires that a commercial electronic mail message provide the customers with an opportunity to opt-out from receiving future commercial electronic mail messages from the sender.

​

At the state level, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides individual privacy rights for California consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers and households. The CCPA requires disclosures to consumers about companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices; provides consumers ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information; and provides consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA prohibits companies from discriminating against consumers who have opted out of the sale of their personal information, subject to a narrow exception. The CCPA provides for certain monetary penalties and for enforcement of the statute by the California Attorney General or by consumers whose rights under the law are not observed. It also provides for damages, as well as injunctive or declaratory relief, if there has been unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of personal information due to failure to implement reasonable security procedures. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including a provision to the effect that the CCPA does not apply where the information is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA if the GLBA is in conflict with the CCPA. 

​

In November 2020, California voters passed Proposition 24, known as the California Privacy Rights Act or CPRA. CPRA, which will amend existing CCPA requirements effective January 2023 with a one-year lookback period, includes limitations on the sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising and the use of “sensitive” personal information; the creation of a new correction right; and the establishment of a new agency to enforce California privacy law. 

​

Additionally, legislative and regulatory measures, such as mandatory breach notification provisions, often impose, among other elements, strict requirements on reporting time frames and providing notice to individuals. For example, at the federal level, the FDIC announced in November 2021 the implementation of a new Rule (12 CFR Part 304) which requires notification of our primary regulator within 36 hours in the event of a “Computer-security incident” that rises to the level of a “notification incident.” All 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia also have enacted data breach 

11 
notification laws. Further, there continues to be an increased interest in privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations at the federal and state levels where legislators are reviewing or proposing the need for greater regulation of the collection, sharing, use and other processing of consumer information for marketing purposes or otherwise.

​

There has also been rapid development of new privacy laws and regulations elsewhere around the globe, including amendments of existing data protection laws, to the scope of such laws and penalties for noncompliance. Failure to comply with these international data protection laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.

​

Compliance with current or future privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations (including those regarding data breach notification and consumer privacy) affecting customer, employee or other data to which we are subject could result in higher compliance and technology costs and could restrict our ability to provide certain products and services (such as products or services that involve us sharing information with third parties or storing sensitive credit card information), which could materially and adversely affect our profitability. Our failure to comply with privacy, data protection and information security laws and regulations could result in potentially significant regulatory investigations and government actions, litigation, fines or sanctions, consumer or partner actions, decreases in the use of our cards and damage to our reputation and our brand, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

​

Human Capital

​

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 6,000 associates worldwide, with the majority concentrated in the United States. As a core component of our broader Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) and sustainability efforts, our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop and retain top talent. To support these objectives, we take a holistic approach to our associates’ experiences as employees, recognizing that an engaged workforce drives our long-term growth and sustainability. Our Board of Directors and designated Board committees provide the important oversight of our human capital management strategy, including diversity, equity and inclusion, or DE&I, efforts, which are led by our head of diversity and inclusion and our Chief Diversity Officer, both appointed in 2021. In May 2021, our Board of Directors expanded the compensation committee’s responsibilities and duties to more specifically include oversight of our management of human capital and, in connection with these changes, the committee’s name was formally changed to the “Compensation & Human Capital Committee.” Our Compensation & Human Capital Committee, along with our Board of Directors, receive regular updates from senior management and third-party consultants on human capital trends and developments and other key human capital matters that drive our ongoing success and performance. 

​

Associate Wellbeing

​

With the ongoing impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 95% of our total workforce continues to successfully work from home, and with minimal business disruption. We have continued initiatives designed to connect, recognize and engage our workforce in a virtual work environment, including providing the necessary technology, support and lines of communication for our associates to be successful in their roles in this unique environment. Associate wellbeing remained a top priority in 2021, and we continued to provide timely reminders and access to numerous existing and new resources and support, including a particular focus on mental health awareness and counselling support. Other associate wellbeing resources include financial education and wellness courses, a variety of online fitness and meditation classes, a fitness cost reimbursement program and other benefits to promote mental and physical health and overall wellbeing. We surveyed our associates on our return-to-office plans and their work environment preferences, and we anticipate the majority of our workforce will continue to work remotely or on a hybrid basis for the foreseeable future. For those associates who worked in the office during the year, or plan to return, our COVID taskforce has been focused on taking appropriate health and safety measures in our office space. We implemented a COVID testing solution beginning in 2022 to ensure those associates who are not vaccinated have the option to work in the office, while protecting the safety of all associates.

​

Additionally during 2021, we further improved the competitiveness of our associate benefit offerings, including implementing new paid time off and flex time off policies to provide additional flexibility for our associates, adding a new paid holiday (bringing the total to nine) and offering new virtual benefit fairs, among other initiatives.

Associate Engagement

​

Despite various challenges associated with the pandemic, we maintained high levels of associate engagement and retention and were successful with talent acquisition, hiring several top industry leaders in key positions that further supported our transformation initiatives and business priorities. For 2021, we recorded a new associate acquisition rate of approximately 21%, calculated as total external hires divided by average associate headcount, with voluntary turnover at approximately 17%, calculated as total voluntary terminations divided by average associate headcount, across both professional and Care Center operations, as compared to 10% and 13%, respectively, in 2020. As discussed below, in 2021 we focused on developing our internal talent to increase lateral movement across the organization, with nearly a third of the 1,200 new jobs posted in 2021 being ultimately filled by internal candidates. We continue to listen to and act on feedback from our associates, including through our annual Associate Survey and other more frequent surveys and communications. Our core associate experience scores improved in 2021 compared to the previous year, reflective of favorable associate feedback received from conducting our annual Associate Survey. 

​

Workforce Readiness, Development and Advancement

​

As part of our broader multi-year business transformation, our “future workforce” steering committee, comprising senior human resources, technology and operations management, continued to develop and execute human capital-intensive strategies to ensure our workforce readiness, development and advancement. During the year we launched our inaugural six-month apprenticeship program, which created a feeder pipeline from roles in our Care Centers to other non-Care Center opportunities across the organization, with 21 associates transitioning to new roles at the conclusion of their apprenticeships. Robust training and development remains central to our human capital strategy, and in 2021 we expanded our training programs to include more content focused on developing effective leadership competencies and behaviors. In addition to career-oriented training and development, we require annual associate training to ensure ongoing adherence to responsible business practices and ethical conduct, and all associates must certify annually that they have read and will adhere to our Code of Ethics. We believe that these efforts resonated with our associates, as we saw a 7% improvement in associates’ perceptions of the professional growth and development initiatives taken by us, reflected in our 2021 annual Associate Survey.

​

Given the significant amount of change and transformation in our business, in 2021 we created a “change network” comprising more than 200 associates from across the Company. This network provides a formal forum for developing and activating change management strategies, which enables us to respond, as necessary, in real-time with enhanced communication or other support. We also cascaded change management training throughout all leaders of our organization, including our executive management team. 

​

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

​

In 2020, we undertook significant steps to improve our commitment to DE&I, starting with a formal process initiated by our President and Chief Executive Officer. Specific actions taken have included executive leadership involvement and accountability; and formation of a DE&I steering committee with clear objectives, including identifying and engaging a third-party, minority-owned DE&I consulting firm to guide our development of a comprehensive, integrated DE&I strategy and measurement framework. Significant progress made over the second half of 2020 included associate surveys, focus groups and numerous associate “listening sessions” to provide important input on our approach to improving our long-term DE&I commitments in 2021. Our entire executive leadership team underwent unconscious bias awareness training, and new tools were introduced in our recruiting and hiring practices to further improve our processes in this area. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 62% of our total work force and 44% of our senior leaders were female, while approximately 43% of our total work force and 16% of our senior leaders were minorities.

​

In 2021, we continued the evolution and advancement of our DE&I strategy and objectives, an ongoing business imperative. We continued expanding our DE&I team and leadership, through the hiring of a new head of diversity and inclusion, the creation of the office of Chief Diversity Officer (reporting to our President and Chief Executive Officer), and the creation of a company-wide council on DE&I matters. We more formally identified our DE&I strategy and priorities, re-chartered our existing business resource groups (BRGs) as well as identified new BRGs based on associate feedback and interests. We expanded our foundational training around conscious inclusion for all associates and leaders, and evaluated metrics of success to ensure we hold ourselves accountable to our progress on DE&I matters. As of 

13 
December 31, 2021, approximately 60% of our total work force and 43% of our senior leaders were female, while approximately 41% of our total work force and 17% of our senior leaders were minorities.
