Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings 

In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, management separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization, expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs, certain impacts from the Kyndryl separation and related tax effects. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections and any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. Management also characterizes direct and incremental charges incurred related to the Kyndryl separation as non-operating given their unique and non-recurring nature. These charges include applicable employee awards and tax impacts related to the separation. Given its unique and temporary nature, management has also characterized the unrealized gain on Kyndryl common stock recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as non-operating. The gain reflects fair value changes in the shares that were retained by the company immediately following the separation, with the intent to dispose of such shares within twelve months after the distribution. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company’s acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business.

Overall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts. Our reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with our management and measurement system.

Separation of Kyndryl

On November 3, 2021, IBM took an important step in advancing its focus on hybrid cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the separation of its managed infrastructure services unit into a new public company, Kyndryl. The separation of Kyndryl creates two industry-leading companies, which will continue to have a strong commercial relationship. Both IBM and Kyndryl have increased clarity and ability to focus on their respective operating and financial models, including capital deployment, investment strategies, and investment grade capital structures. The separation enables greater freedom of action to partner and capture new opportunities. The outcome of all of these actions will be increased value for clients and investors.

Global Pandemic

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic which resulted in significant governmental measures being initiated around the globe to slow down and control the spread of the virus. As we managed through the second year of the pandemic, the health of IBM employees, our clients, business partners and community remains our primary focus. We are actively engaged to ensure our plans continue to be aligned with recommendations of the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and governmental regulations.

The continued environment of uncertainty has only reinforced the need for clients to modernize their businesses to succeed in this new normal, with hybrid cloud and AI at the core of their digital transformations. Across industries, clients are using technology as a source of competitive advantage. We are enabling clients’ transformations by embedding technology at the core of their businesses. Among other things, for example, we are leveraging our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities to help clients reimagine critical workflows, at scale, and modernize applications to increase agility, drive innovation and create operational efficiencies. We are also applying data analytics and automation to mitigate friction in their supply chains and automate business tasks.

The spending environment continued to improve throughout the year despite additional waves of the pandemic. From an industry standpoint, we have seen meaningful improvement in areas most affected by the pandemic such as travel, transportation, automotive and industrial products as well as retail and consumer packaged goods. IBM continues to be well positioned to support our clients to emerge even stronger.

Financial Performance Summary

In 2021, we reported $57.4 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $4.7 billion and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $7.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $5.21 as reported and $7.93 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. On a consolidated basis, we generated $12.8 billion in cash from operations and $6.5 billion in free cash flow, which includes 10 months of Kyndryl operations, cash impacts from the structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter of 2020 and Kyndryl separation-related charges, and delivered shareholder returns of $5.9 billion in dividends. These results reflect progress in our key growth areas resulting from the strong client demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. We continue to increase investments in skills, innovation and our ecosystem, and our balance sheet continues to provide us with the flexibility to support our business needs.

Total revenue grew 3.9 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year with increases in our key growth areas of software and consulting. Year-to-year performance also included a benefit from incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, which represented approximately 1 point of our full-year revenue growth. Software revenue increased 5.3 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency, including approximately 2 points of growth from fourth-quarter sales to Kyndryl. Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 8.8 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency), led by strong double-digit growth in Red Hat. Transaction Processing declined 3.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) as clients continued their preference for operating expenses over capital expenditures. Consulting revenue increased 9.8 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency with growth across all three business areas. Infrastructure revenue decreased 2.4 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency, with the overall decline in revenue reflecting our product cycle dynamics. This performance also includes approximately 1 point of growth from fourth-quarter sales to Kyndryl. Across the segments, total hybrid cloud revenue of $20.2 billion in 2021 grew 20 percent as reported and 19 percent adjusted for currency.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue grew 4.4 percent year to year as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) increased 4.1 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific grew 2.8 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency). 

The gross margin of 54.9 percent decreased 1.0 point year to year, however, gross profit dollars increased 2.0 percent compared to the prior year. Overall, gross margin was impacted by the significant investments we are making to drive our hybrid cloud and AI strategy as well as our product cycle dynamics. The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 56.2 percent decreased 1.1 points versus the prior year. 

Total expense and other (income) decreased 5.8 percent in 2021 versus the prior year primarily driven by a $1.9 billion (7 points) decrease in charges for workforce rebalancing and a benefit from expected credit loss expense in the current year compared to a provision in the prior year, partially offset by higher non-operating retirement-related costs and the effects of currency. Our expense dynamics reflect a higher level of investment in innovation, skills and our ecosystem, both organically and through acquisitions, as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We are aggressively hiring and scaling resources to better serve clients, while increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum and we are expanding our ecosystem. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 6.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $4.8 billion increased 88.0 percent and the pre-tax margin was 8.4 percent, an increase of 3.8 points versus 2020, primarily due to the higher workforce rebalancing charges in 2020. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2021 was 2.6 percent compared to (52.9) percent in 2020. The current year effective tax rate was primarily driven by tax benefits related to audit settlements in multiple jurisdictions. The prior-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the company’s intellectual property (IP) in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. Net income from continuing operations of $4.7 billion increased 19.8 percent and the net income from continuing operations margin was 8.2 percent, up 1.1 points year to year. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax

income from continuing operations of $7.9 billion increased 43.6 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 3.8 points to 13.7 percent, reflecting the lower workforce rebalancing charges in the current year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2021 was 9.0 percent compared to (11.5) percent in 2020. The prior year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $7.2 billion increased 17.2 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 12.5 percent was up 1.4 points year to year. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $5.21 in 2021 increased 18.9 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $7.93 increased 16.3 percent versus 2020, with the prior year including a ($1.33) impact from the fourth-quarter structural actions on both an as reported and operating (non-GAAP) basis.

Our balance sheet is presented on a consolidated basis, with the December 31, 2020 balance sheet reclassified to provide line items on a continuing operations basis and separately provide current and noncurrent assets and liabilities for Kyndryl discontinued operations. In order to present a meaningful year-to-year comparison, the amounts presented below exclude assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.

At December 31, 2021, the balance sheet remained strong with the flexibility to support and invest in the business needs. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $7.6 billion, a decrease of $6.7 billion from December 31, 2020. During 2021, we continued to de-lever our debt, invest in acquisitions and provide a growing dividend to shareholders. We have reduced total debt by $9.6 billion from prior year end and $21.3 billion since the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat transaction).

Total assets, excluding discontinued operations, decreased $8.2 billion (decreased $5.1 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by:

•A decrease of $6.7 billion ($6.5 billion adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities due to debt paydown, investments in acquisitions and dividend payments;

•A decline in receivables of $3.5 billion ($2.8 billion adjusted for currency) primarily due to sales of financing receivables and volumes decline; and

•A decrease in deferred taxes of $1.0 billion ($0.7 billion adjusted for currency) primarily due to pension plan remeasurements, foreign audit settlements and realization of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions; partially offset by

•An increase in prepaid pension assets of $2.3 billion ($2.4 billion adjusted for currency) driven by plan remeasurements and higher returns on plan assets; and

•An increase of $1.4 billion ($1.5 billion adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to our investment in Kyndryl and an increase in derivative assets. 

Total liabilities, excluding discontinued operations, decreased $15.1 billion (decreased $10.9 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2020 primarily driven by:

•A decrease in total debt of $9.6 billion ($8.4 billion adjusted for currency) primarily driven by debt maturities and early retirements;

•A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations of $2.7 billion ($1.9 billion adjusted for currency) mainly driven by plan remeasurements; and

•A decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $1.7 billion ($1.2 billion adjusted for currency) primarily due to payments for workforce rebalancing actions.

Total equity of $19.0 billion decreased $1.7 billion from December 31, 2020 as a result of:

•A decrease of $7.2 billion related to the separation of Kyndryl; and

•Dividends paid of $5.9 billion; partially offset by

•Net income of $5.7 billion; and

•A decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $4.8 billion.

Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, include the cash flows of discontinued operations. For 2021, they included 10 months of Kyndryl operations versus a full year of Kyndryl in 2020.

On a consolidated basis, cash provided by operating activities was $12.8 billion in 2021, a decrease of $5.4 billion compared to 2020, driven primarily by a decrease in cash provided by receivables ($3.9 billion) and a decrease in payroll tax and value-added tax payment

liabilities ($1.0 billion) due to payments in the current year for tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs in 2020. 

Net cash used in investing activities of $6.0 billion increased $2.9 billion compared to the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in net cash used for acquisitions ($3.0 billion). 

Financing activities were a net use of cash of $13.4 billion in 2021 compared to $9.7 billion in 2020. The year-to-year increase of $3.6 billion was driven by a decrease in net cash provided from debt transactions ($4.4 billion), partially offset by an increase in cash provided of $0.9 billion due to the Kyndryl distribution to IBM at separation.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Please refer to IBM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2022, for Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.”

IBM is addressing the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity with a platform-centric approach, focused on providing two primary sources of client value – technology and business expertise. We provide integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology and services capabilities support clients’ digital transformations and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of capabilities in software, consulting services, and a deep incumbency in mission-critical systems, all bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

IBM Strategy

Our strategy is focused on helping clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and Artificial Intelligence (AI). In 2021, we took an important step with the spin-off of our managed infrastructure services business, now known as Kyndryl. Our strategy resonates with clients, who must continually innovate and redefine their businesses with technology. Our flexible, secure, and open hybrid cloud platform accelerates clients’ outcomes, differentiates the company, and drives a multiplier effect across our software, consulting, and infrastructure businesses as well as to a broad ecosystem of partners. Our strategy positions IBM for accelerated growth today, while preparing the company for the opportunities of the future. 

Accelerating Digital Transformation 

A new era of rapid change and disruption is underway. The need for digital transformation has dramatically accelerated due to the pandemic and extends through the core mission-critical business processes of almost all large enterprises. Successful digital transformations face major obstacles: (1) managing increased complexity, as large enterprises use multiple heterogeneous IT environments and clouds, (2) deriving value from an explosion of available data, projected by analysts to grow up to three-fold in the next three years, (3) guaranteeing competitive operations, in the context of disruptive changes and worker shortages, (4) addressing the increase of malicious security breaches and rising cost of cybercrime, and (5) successfully meeting those challenges together with a cohesive end-to-end sustainable execution. 

To address these obstacles, enterprises want technology that provides flexibility with open-source across heterogeneous environments – an approach known as hybrid cloud. We have demonstrated that such an approach creates 2.5 times more value for enterprises than a public cloud-only one. Open-source technologies, such as Linux, containers, and Kubernetes, are essential to hybrid cloud, as they harness the power of millions of developers to accelerate the speed of innovation. 85 percent of organizations expect to use Linux containers by 2025. Additionally, AI continues to expand as a key technology to unlock value, with more than 80 percent of enterprises agreeing that intelligent automation can improve business results. As AI for production scales, enterprises and governments focus on ensuring AI models are unbiased and trustworthy. 

A Differentiated Architecture for Business Innovation

The evolution we see in the market confirms the strategic changes executed by IBM to deliver on a hybrid cloud and AI strategy, creating sustained value for our clients. Our differentiation derives from a flexible, secure, open hybrid cloud platform, the comprehensive set of assets it impacts, and our ability to combine them to scale up solutions for enterprise digital transformation and mission-critical systems. 

Our value proposition builds on five core capabilities, addressing our clients’ hybrid cloud and AI needs: (1) Build and modernize for the hybrid cloud, to develop and operate with speed, consistency and agility, (2) Create data-driven business insights regardless of where data lives and while maintaining enterprise grade data governance, privacy and trust, (3) Automate the end-to-end enterprise processes, for effectiveness and efficiency with AI driven decision-making, (4) Secure everywhere, with consistent governance and compliance across environments, and (5) Bring it together by transforming our clients’ businesses and processes into sustainable best-in-class industry practices.

Distributed Infrastructure: the portfolio is uniquely positioned for hybrid cloud, meeting client demands for scalability, security and capacity. Distributed Infrastructure includes Power, Storage, and IBM Cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Power consists of high-performance servers, designed and engineered for big data and AI-enabled workloads and are optimized for hybrid cloud and Linux. The Storage portfolio consists of a broad range of storage hardware and software-defined offerings, including Z-attach and distributed flash, tape solutions, software-defined storage controllers, data protection software and network-attach storage. Both Power and Storage offerings are available via flexible consumption models. IBM Cloud IaaS is built on enterprise-grade hardware with an open architecture and is specifically designed for regulated industries with leading security and compliance capabilities. IBM Cloud IaaS offers flexible computing options across x86, Power, Storage and IBM Z as a service to meet client workload needs.

Infrastructure Support: works across hybrid cloud environments providing a uniquely integrated services experience for clients. Infrastructure Support delivers comprehensive, proactive and AI-enabled services to maintain and improve the availability and value of clients’ IT infrastructure (hardware and software) both on-premises and in the cloud. These offerings include maintenance for IBM products and other technology platforms, as well as open source and cross-vendor software and solution support.

Financing

Financing facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services through its financing solutions. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end users’ business operations and support IBM’s hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. Financing conducts a comprehensive credit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity.

Financing comprises the following two business areas – Client Financing and Commercial Financing:

Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end-user clients for terms up to seven years, and internal loan financing in support of IBM IaaS service arrangements. Assets financed are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where we have expertise.

Commercial Financing: short-term working capital financing to distributors and resellers primarily of IBM products. In 2019, we began the wind down of the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) IT portion of our commercial financing operations which completed in early 2021. In the fourth-quarter 2020, Financing expanded its financial flexibility by entering into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3 billion of its IBM commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis over the agreement’s three-year term.

Human Capital

Employees and Related Workforce[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*

The complementary workforce is an approximation of equivalent full-time employees hired under temporary, part-time and limited-term employment arrangements to meet specific business needs in a flexible and cost-effective manner.

​

As a globally integrated enterprise, IBM operates in more than 175 countries and is continuing to shift our business to the higher value segments of enterprise IT. Our global workforce is highly skilled, reflective of the work we do for our clients’ digital transformations and in support of their mission-critical operations. Our global workforce includes developers, consultants, client delivery and services specialists, research scientists and others. Our employees are among the world’s leading experts in cloud, AI, quantum computing, cybersecurity and industry-specific solutions.

In November 2021, we completed the separation of our managed infrastructure services business to Kyndryl, comprising approximately 90,000 employees. Over our 111-year history, we have consistently made bold moves to transform and develop our talent. Today, IBM employees are clearly focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy for growth.

Talent and Culture 

IBM attracts, develops, engages and retains talent in a dynamic and competitive environment. IBM offers a compelling employee value proposition: we develop and deliver innovative technologies including hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum, for clients whose businesses the world relies on. IBM is continuously transforming and developing its talent, both through learning and hiring. Voluntary attrition was higher in 2021 than in 2020 consistent with the overall labor market. On a longer horizon, the average voluntary attrition rate of the pandemic years (2020 and 2021) was still lower than the previous two years (2018 and 2019). In 2021, we added skills in consulting

and key technical areas. We are scaling our investments in garages, client engineering centers and customer success managers. Employees are encouraged and enabled to learn and grow their careers, with employees using our learning platform to complete more than 70 hours of learning on average in 2021. Our digital learning and career platform uses Watson AI to generate personalized recommendations and includes peer-to-peer collaboration and internal social sharing. Over 170,000 employees globally participated in our annual engagement survey, which measures factors such as workplace experience, inclusion, pride and propensity to recommend IBM as an employer. Our industry-leading talent practices enabled more than eight out of ten employees to be highly engaged. Every manager and leader in IBM has access to their team and organization engagement levels along with actionable data-driven insights. 

Diversity and Inclusion

IBM has a long, proud history as a pioneer in diversity and inclusion. A diverse and inclusive workplace leads to greater innovation, agility, performance, and engagement, enabling both business growth and societal impact. We ensure employees from diverse backgrounds are engaged, can be their authentic selves, build skills and grow their careers. In April 2021, with the full support of our Board of Directors, we disclosed an overview of our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and programs, including diversity representation data and remain committed to continued transparency in 2022. We are proud of our inclusive culture, with nine out of ten employees responding that they can be their authentic selves at work. Our focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace led to increased levels of inclusion for women, Black and Hispanic employees. Women make up more than one-third of our workforce, and we increased representation of women, Black and Hispanic employees in 2021 compared to the prior year. In addition, executive representation of women globally, and Hispanic and Black executives in the U.S. improved by 1.0 point, 0.4 points and 1.5 points, respectively, in 2021. Further, a diversity modifier was added to the executive compensation program in 2021 to reinforce our continued accountability for progress. Globally, IBM executives are measured on the improvement of diversity and inclusion for women. In the U.S., executives are also measured on improvement of diversity and inclusion for U.S. underrepresented minorities. While we have taken significant actions and made progress, we have ongoing work to do.

IBM believes in pay equity: we have had an equal pay policy since 1935 and a long-standing practice of maintaining pay equity. To this end, we conduct statistical pay equity analysis that includes all countries with IBM employees. We also empower employees to understand their pay by providing comprehensive education and transparent access to pay statements including a comparison to market pay ranges.

Health, Safety and Well-Being

We have a long-standing commitment to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. This remained a focus in 2021 as we continued to face the COVID-19 pandemic. We have a robust case management system to manage COVID-19 exposures and a comprehensive playbook on workplace health and safety measures that allow our offices to reopen when local clinical conditions allow. These measures include limiting travel and in-person meetings and events, required self-screening before accessing workplaces, and imposing strict social distancing and mask wearing. In countries where vaccine access is sufficient or where legally mandated, only employees who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can access IBM workplaces.

Additionally, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IBM has focused on mental health and supporting our employees for the long run with programs shaped by frequent survey polls and employee input sessions. Such programs include: four weeks additional paid time off for working parents and caregivers facing disruption, training for employees on resilience and for managers on how to identify and address mental health issues and financial counseling offerings tailored to pandemic-related matters. Employees are supported with 24/7 access to IBM’s world-class Health and Safety team, education, timely updates and forums to ask questions and raise concerns.

YEAR IN REVIEW

Results of Continuing Operations

As discussed in the “Organization of Information” section, with the completion of the separation on November 3, 2021 results of Kyndryl are reported as discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the Management Discussion to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations.

Segment Details

In the fourth quarter of 2021, immediately prior to the separation of Kyndryl, the company made a number of changes to its organizational structure and management system to align the company’s operating model to its platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. With these changes, the company revised its reportable segments, but did not impact its Consolidated Financial Statements. The table below presents each reportable segment’s revenue and gross margin results, followed by an analysis of the 2021 versus 2020 reportable segment results. Prior-year results have been recast to conform with the changes noted above.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Software[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Software revenue of $24,141 million increased 5.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 2 points of full-year revenue growth. We had strong double-digit growth in Software hybrid cloud revenue as reported and adjusted for currency. There was strong growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, as reported and at constant currency, driven primarily by Red Hat, Security and Automation, as our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI solutions continued to resonate with our clients. Transaction Processing revenue decreased year to year as reported and adjusted for currency. Although a significant portion of the revenue in this area is annuity based, the timing of larger transactions is tied to client buying cycles and their preference for more consumption-like models which impacted sales of perpetual licenses.

Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $17,751 million increased 8.8 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year. The incremental sales from Kyndryl in the fourth quarter of 2021 in Hybrid Platform & Solutions were not

material to the full-year revenue growth. Red Hat revenue increased 30.6 percent as reported (30 percent adjusted for currency), with strong growth across infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies, as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprises’ critical hybrid cloud requirements. We now have 3,800 clients on our hybrid cloud platform as of December 31, 2021, which was an increase of more than 1,000 clients compared to the prior year. Automation revenue increased 6.1 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting solid performance in AIOps and Management as we help our clients address resource management and observability. We are building our capabilities both organically and inorganically, and clients are realizing rapid time to value from our recent acquisitions including Instana and Turbonomic. Security revenue increased 6.8 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) with year-to-year growth across security software and services. Security innovation is an integral part of our strategy, and in the fourth quarter of 2021 we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, and completed the acquisition of ReaQta. Data & AI revenue was flat year to year and declined 1 percent adjusted for currency. Within Data & AI, we had solid year-to-year growth in Data Fabric as well as our Business Analytics and Weather offerings.

Transaction Processing revenue of $6,390 million decreased 3.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year. Incremental sales from Kyndryl in the fourth quarter of 2021 contributed approximately 5 points of full-year revenue growth. In 2021, clients continued their preference for operating expenses over capital expenditures, which continued to put pressure on perpetual licenses, in favor of more consumption-like models. Our subscription and support renewal rate was stronger in 2021 compared to the prior year, reflecting our clients’ commitment to our infrastructure platform and our high-value software offerings.

Within Software, hybrid cloud revenue of $8.7 billion grew 26 percent as reported and 25 percent adjusted for currency year to year, driven by Red Hat as well as our software that has been optimized for our hybrid cloud platform which helps our clients apply AI, automation and security across their environments to transform and improve their business workflows.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The Software gross profit margin increased 0.4 points to 78.8 percent in 2021 compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $4,722 million increased 41.3 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin expansion of 5.0 points to 19.6 percent. The increase in pre-tax income and margin reflects the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in a 3.3 points improvement in the pre-tax margin compared to 2020.

Consulting[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Consulting revenue of $17,844 million increased 9.8 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) in 2021 compared to the prior year, with growth across all three business areas. Clients are accelerating their business transformations and are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner to help drive innovation, increase agility and productivity, and capture new growth opportunities, powered by hybrid cloud and AI. We had strong double-digit growth in Consulting hybrid cloud revenue as reported and adjusted for currency. Our total Consulting signings in 2021 grew at a mid-single-digit rate compared to the prior year and our book-to-bill for 2021 was 1.1. Consulting continued to drive hybrid cloud platform adoption by our clients, with approximately 700 Red Hat engagements in 2021. Our strategic acquisitions and expansion of strategic partnerships also contributed to our year-to-year revenue growth in 2021. 

Business Transformation revenue of $8,284 million increased 15.2 percent as reported (13 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. We had strong demand for our Business Transformation solutions, with good performance across all service lines including growth in offerings such as data platform services, Salesforce consulting services, and SAP consulting services and solutions.

​

Technology Consulting revenue of $3,466 million increased 10.6 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by growth in high-value offerings to develop cloud native applications and modernize existing applications for the cloud.

Application Operations revenue of $6,095 million increased 2.8 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by offerings which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments, reflecting our clients’ trust in IBM Consulting to operate and manage their critical applications whether running in the cloud or on-premises environments. 

Within Consulting, hybrid cloud revenue of $7.9 billion grew 34 percent as reported and 32 percent adjusted for currency, driven by Red Hat-related signings focused on modernizing clients’ applications and revenue from consulting engagements in the areas of our strategic partnerships, such as Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The Consulting gross profit margin decreased 1.3 points to 28.0 percent compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $1,449 million increased 40.1 percent compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin increased 1.8 points to 8.1 percent. The decline in gross profit margin reflects our investment in new offerings, integrating and scaling our acquisitions, as well as increased labor costs due to the competitive labor market which were not yet reflected in our pricing. The year-to-year improvement in pre-tax income reflects increased gross profit dollars driven by growth in revenue. The increase in pre-tax margin compared to the prior year was driven primarily by the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in a 2.9 points improvement in the pre-tax margin, which was partially offset by the decline in gross profit margin.

Consulting Signings and Book-to-Bill[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to conform to 2021 presentation, reflecting the separation of Kyndryl on November 3, 2021.

Signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract within IBM Consulting. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.

Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Total signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger contracts. Signings associated with an acquisition will be recognized on a prospective basis.

Management believes the estimated values of signings disclosed provide an indication of our forward-looking revenue. Signings are used to monitor the performance of the business and viewed as useful information for management and shareholders. The conversion of signings into revenue may vary based on the types of services and solutions, contract duration, customer decisions, and other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic environment.

Book-to-bill represents the ratio of IBM Consulting signings to its revenue over the same period. The metric is a useful indicator of the demand of our business over time. This definition should be read in conjunction with the signings definition noted above.

Infrastructure[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Infrastructure revenue of $14,188 million decreased 2.4 percent year to year as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). In the fourth quarter of 2021, we had incremental sales from Kyndryl, representing approximately 1 point of growth in full-year revenue. The overall decline in revenue reflects our product cycle dynamics. Although impacted by product cycles, our portfolio of products continues to provide critical and lasting value to our clients in support of their hybrid cloud and digital transformation journeys, and we continue to innovate and refresh our product portfolio to deliver enhanced technologies to our clients.

Hybrid Infrastructure revenue of $8,167 million declined 2.9 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). Revenue in 2021 included incremental sales from Kyndryl in fourth quarter, representing approximately 1 point of growth in full-year revenue. The overall decline in revenue reflects product cycle dynamics in IBM Z and our Distributed Infrastructure platforms. IBM Z revenue decreased 4.9 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) as we concluded the tenth quarter of z15 availability at the end of 2021. The z15 program continued to outpace the success of the prior program and we shipped more MIPS in the z15 program than any program in our history. Clients continued to leverage IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure and its combination of security, scalability, reliability, cloud native development, and newer flexible consumption offerings demonstrate the value of the IBM Z platform within our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Distributed Infrastructure revenue declined 1.8 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by declines in Power and Cloud Platform, partially offset by growth in Storage solutions driven by demand from hyperscalers for our tape products. In the third-quarter 2021, our next generation Power 10 became available within the high-end system which has unique hardware innovations, including a processor specifically optimized for data intensive workloads such as SAP S/4HANA.

Infrastructure Support revenue of $6,021 million declined 1.6 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. The fourth-quarter incremental sales from Kyndryl represented approximately 2 points of growth in full-year revenue. The overall decline in revenue in 2021 reflects the hardware product cycles.

Within Infrastructure, hybrid cloud revenue of $3.6 billion declined 10 percent as reported and 11 percent adjusted for currency, driven primarily by product cycle dynamics.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The Infrastructure gross profit margin decreased 2.2 points to 55.3 percent in 2021 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by margin declines in Distributed Infrastructure reflecting product cycle dynamics, partially offset by margin improvement in IBM Z. Pre-tax income of $2,025 million increased 22.4 percent and pre-tax margin increased 2.9 points year to year to 14.3 percent, driven primarily by the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in a 3.6 points improvement in pre-tax margin, partially offset by the decline in gross profit.

Geographic Revenue

In addition to the revenue presentation by reportable segment, we also measure revenue performance on a geographic basis.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Total revenue of $57,350 million in 2021 increased 3.9 percent year to year as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. Revenue in 2021 includes incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl which began in the fourth quarter of 2021, representing approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the year.

Americas revenue increased 4.4 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. In 2021, revenue includes incremental sales from Kyndryl, representing approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the year. Within North America, the U.S. increased 3.0 percent and Canada increased 23.6 percent as reported and 16 percent adjusted for currency. Latin America increased 0.9 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. Within Latin America, Brazil revenue was flat as reported, but grew 3 percent adjusted for currency.

EMEA revenue increased 4.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency. Revenue in 2021 includes incremental sales from Kyndryl, representing approximately 1 point of revenue growth for the year. The UK, France and Germany increased 7.4 percent, 6.5 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively, as reported, and increased 1 percent, 4 percent and 4 percent, respectively, adjusted for currency. Italy increased 0.6 percent as reported, but decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency.

Asia Pacific revenue increased 2.8 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. In 2021, revenue includes incremental sales from Kyndryl, representing approximately 2 points of revenue growth for the year. Japan revenue decreased 0.6 percent as reported, but grew 3 percent adjusted for currency. India increased 6.8 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency. Australia increased 7.7 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency. China increased 2.0 percent as reported, but declined 2 percent adjusted for currency.

Total Expense and Other (Income)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter. 

NM–Not meaningful

Our expense dynamics reflect a higher level of investment in innovation, skills and our ecosystem, both organically and through acquisitions, as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We are aggressively hiring to better serve clients, while increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum, and we are expanding our ecosystem. 

Total expense and other (income) decreased 5.8 percent in 2021 versus the prior year primarily driven by a $1.9 billion decrease in charges for workforce rebalancing, including the charges for structural actions in the fourth quarter of 2020, and a benefit from expected credit loss expense in the current year compared to a provision in the prior year, partially offset by higher non-operating retirement-related costs and the effects of currency. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 6.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors above excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.

​ 
22Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

For additional information regarding total expense and other (income) for both expense presentations, see the following analyses by category.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter.

NM–Not meaningful

Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 8.8 percent in 2021 versus 2020, driven primarily by the following factors:

•Lower workforce rebalancing charges in the current year (9 points); and

•A benefit from expected credit loss expense compared to a provision in the prior year (1 point); partially offset by 

•The effects of currency (1 point). 

Operating (non-GAAP) SG&A expense decreased 9.6 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors. 

Provisions for expected credit loss expense decreased $154 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily driven by decreases in both specific and general reserves in the current year compared to increases in the prior year. In the prior year, the global pandemic resulted in some deterioration in customer credit quality and/or bankruptcies which had an impact to provisions in the first half of 2020. We saw continued improvement in credit quality and some emergence from bankruptcies in the current year as economies have begun to reopen in many parts of the world. The receivables provision coverage was 2.1 percent at December 31, 2021, a decrease of 10 basis points from December 31, 2020.

Research, Development and Engineering Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Research, development and engineering (RD&E) expense increased 3.6 percent in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting our continuing investment in innovation as we increase spending in areas including quantum, hybrid cloud and AI. The year-to-year increase was primarily driven by higher spending (2 points) and the effects of currency (1 point). 

Intellectual Property and Custom Development Income[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total Intellectual Property and Custom Development Income decreased 1.4 percent in 2021 compared to 2020. The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.

​

Other (Income) and Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM–Not meaningful

Total other (income) and expense was $873 million of expense in 2021 compared to $802 million in 2020. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:

•Higher non-operating retirement-related costs ($209 million). Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information; and 

•Lower interest income ($53 million) driven by lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in the current year; partially offset by 

•An unrealized gain on the shares of Kyndryl stock retained by IBM ($126 million).

Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $285 million of income in 2021 and increased $13 million compared to the prior-year period and excludes the impacts of non-operating retirement-related costs, the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the unrealized gain on Kyndryl stock described above. 

Interest Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Interest expense decreased $133 million compared to 2020. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement only if the related external borrowings are to support the Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2021 was $1,547 million, a decrease of $191 million year to year primarily driven by a lower average debt balance in the current year.

Stock-Based Compensation

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost of $919 million increased $45 million compared to 2020. This was primarily due to increases related to the conversion of options previously issued by acquired entities ($30 million) and restricted stock units ($25 million), partially offset by a decrease from performance share units ($10 million). Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories: Cost: $145 million, up $19 million; SG&A expense: $555 million, up $5 million; and RD&E expense: $218 million, up $21 million.

Retirement-Related Plans

The following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans. Total operating costs/(income) are included in the Consolidated Income Statement within the caption (e.g., Cost, SG&A, RD&E) relating to the job function of the plan participants.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $150 million compared to 2020, primarily driven by lower expected returns on plan assets ($481 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($239 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($555 million).

As discussed in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, we characterize certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2021 were $1,320 million, a decrease of $59 million compared to 2020. Non-operating costs of $1,282 million in 2021 increased $209 million year to year, driven primarily by the same factors as above.

Income Taxes

The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2021 was 2.6 percent compared to (52.9) percent in 2020. The current year effective tax rate was primarily driven by tax benefits related to audit settlements in multiple jurisdictions. The prior-year effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the company’s intellectual property in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2021 was 9.0 percent compared to (11.5) percent in 2020. The prior year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale. For more information, see note H, “Taxes.”

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*

The $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter resulted in an impact of ($1.33) to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and diluted operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share. The impact to basic earnings per share was ($1.34). 

Actual shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were 898.1 million and 892.7 million, respectively. The year-to-year increase was primarily the result of the common stock issued under employee plans. The average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution was 8.0 million shares higher in 2021 versus 2020.

Financial Position

Dynamics

Our balance sheet is presented on a consolidated basis, with the December 31, 2020 balance sheet reclassified to provide line items on a continuing operations basis and separately provide current and noncurrent assets and liabilities for Kyndryl discontinued operations. Our post-separation balance sheet at December 31, 2021 continues to provide us with flexibility to support our business needs. We continue to manage the investment portfolio to meet our liquidity objectives.

Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2021 were $7,556 million, a decrease of $6,695 million compared to prior year end, as we continued to actively de-lever our debt, invested $3,293 million in acquisitions and provided a growing dividend to our shareholders. Financing receivables declined $4,540 million to $13,439 million since the end of 2020 primarily due to the strategic actions taken to re-focus our Financing portfolio. Assets from discontinued operations declined $15,764 million due to the separation of Kyndryl, which occurred on November 3, 2021. 

Total debt of $51,703 million decreased $9,629 million from prior year end. We have reduced total debt $21,307 million since the end of the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). We have made good progress in deleveraging while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business or our solid dividend policy. Liabilities from discontinued operations declined $7,136 million due to the separation of Kyndryl.

Our cash flow is presented on a consolidated basis and includes 10 months of Kyndryl operations for 2021 versus a full year of Kyndryl operations for 2020. During 2021, we generated $12,796 million in cash from operating activities, a decrease of $5,401 million compared to 2020. Our cash from operating activities for 2021 reflects cash paid in 2021 for separation charges and structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020. We returned $5,869 million to shareholders through dividends in 2021. Our cash generation permits us to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.

Consistent with accounting standards, the company remeasured the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans at December 31. At December 31, 2021, the overall net underfunded position was $5,450 million, a decrease of $5,033 million from December 31, 2020, driven by higher discount rates partially offset by modest asset returns. At year end, our qualified defined benefit plans were well-funded and the required contributions related to these plans and multi-employer plans are expected to be approximately $200 million 2022. In 2021, the return on the U.S. Personal Pension Plan assets was 2.0 percent and the plan was 112 percent funded at December 31, 2021. Overall, global asset returns were 3.0 percent and the qualified defined benefit plans worldwide were 107 percent funded at December 31, 2021.

IBM Working Capital[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Amounts presented exclude the current assets and current liabilities of discontinued operations of $2,618 million and $3,820 million, respectively.

Working capital decreased $4,577 million from the year-end 2020 position. The key changes are described below:

Current assets decreased $7,008 million ($6,060 million adjusted for currency) due to:

•A decrease of $6,695 million ($6,464 million adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities due to debt paydown, investments in acquisitions and dividend payments; and

•A decline in receivables of $1,607 million ($1,115 million adjusted for currency) mainly due to sales of financing receivables; partially offset by

•An increase of $1,378 million ($1,536 million adjusted for currency) in prepaid expenses and other current assets primarily due to investment in Kyndryl of $807 million and an increase in derivative assets. 

Current liabilities decreased $2,430 million ($1,080 million adjusted for currency) as a result of:

•A decrease in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $1,740 million ($1,188 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to payments of $1,640 million for workforce rebalancing actions;

•A decrease in taxes payable of $909 million ($777 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by tax payments and a decline in reserves as a result of the resolution of certain tax audit matters; and

•A decrease in short-term debt of $329 million ($317 million adjusted for currency) due to maturities of $7,155 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $6,792 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities; partially offset by

•An increase in deferred income of $538 million ($926 million adjusted for currency).

The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 2.1 percent at December 31, 2021, excluding receivables classified as held for sale, a decrease of 10 basis points compared to December 31, 2020. The decrease in coverage and decrease in allowance were driven by the overall decrease in receivables and an improvement in certain customers’ credit quality given the improvement of the macroeconomic environment since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020. The majority of the write-offs during the year related to receivables which had been previously reserved.

The decrease in noncurrent assets of $1,198 million (an increase of $967 million adjusted for currency) was driven by:

•A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,662 million ($1,425 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to volumes decline and sales of receivables; and

•A decrease in deferred taxes of $1,034 million ($735 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to pension plan remeasurements, foreign audit settlements and realization of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions; and

•A decrease in net property, plant and equipment of $511 million ($315 million adjusted for currency); and 

•A decrease of $934 million ($587 million adjusted for currency) in total operating right-of-use assets, deferred costs and investments and sundry assets; partially offset by

•An increase in prepaid pension assets of $2,293 million ($2,405 million adjusted for currency) driven by plan remeasurements and higher returns on plan assets; and

•An increase in goodwill and net intangible assets of $650 million ($1,625 million adjusted for currency) due to additions from new acquisitions, partially offset by intangibles amortization.

Long-term debt decreased $9,300 million ($8,092 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by:

•Reclassifications to short-term debt of $6,792 million to reflect upcoming maturities; and

•Early redemption of IBM Credit debt of $1,250 million.

Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) decreased $3,372 million ($1,680 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by:

•A decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations of $2,749 million ($1,875 million adjusted for currency) mainly driven by plan remeasurements; and

•A decrease of $623 million (an increase of $195 million adjusted for currency) in operating lease liabilities, other liabilities and deferred income.

Financing segment debt includes debt of $1,345 million in 2021 and $4,311 million in 2020 to support intercompany financing receivables and other intercompany assets. Refer to Financing’s “Financial Position” on page 55 for additional details.

​

Total debt of $51,703 million decreased $9,629 million ($8,410 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2020, primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $8,557 million. Total debt decreased $21,307 million since the end of the second quarter 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition).

Non-Financing debt of $37,775 million decreased $2,460 million ($1,640 million adjusting for currency) from December 31, 2020 due to scheduled debt maturities during 2021.

Financing segment debt of $13,929 million decreased $7,170 million ($6,770 million adjusting for currency) from December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower external funding requirements associated with financing receivables, as well as lower internal funding requirements after the separation of Kyndryl. In the first quarter of 2021, IBM Credit early redeemed all of its outstanding fixed-rate debt in the aggregate amount of $1.75 billion and deregistered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Financing provides financing solutions predominantly for IBM’s external client assets, and the debt used to fund Financing assets is primarily composed of intercompany loans. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing. The Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at December 31, 2021.

We measure Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Financing Results of Operations” and in note E, “Segments.” In the Consolidated Income

Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Financing’s internal financing to the company is classified as interest expense.

Equity

Total equity decreased $1,731 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease of $7,203 million related to the separation of Kyndryl and dividends paid of $5,869 million; partially offset by increases from net income of $5,743 million, a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $4,839 driven by retirement-related benefit plans ($3,828 million), cash flow hedges ($438 million) and foreign currency translation adjustments ($573 million) and common stock of $762 million.

Cash Flow

Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 65 are summarized in the table below and include the cash flows of discontinued operations. These amounts also include the cash flows associated with the Financing business.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $5,401 million in 2021 driven by the following key factors:

•A decrease of cash provided by receivables of $3,925 million primarily driven by higher volumes in trade receivables;

•A decrease in payroll tax and value-added tax payment liabilities of approximately $1,000 million due to payments in the current year for tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs in 2020 related to COVID-19; and

•An increase in payments for structural actions and Kyndryl separation-related charges; partially offset by performance related improvements within net income. 

Net cash used in investing activities increased $2,947 million driven by:

•An increase in net cash used for acquisitions of $2,958 million aligned with our hybrid cloud and AI strategy;

•A decrease of $475 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations; and

•A decrease in cash provided by divestitures of $389 million; partially offset by

•A decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures of $661 million.

Net cash used in financing activities increased $3,633 million driven by:

•A decrease in net cash provided by debt transactions of $4,401 million driven primarily by a higher level of net additions in the prior year, partially offset by a lower level of maturities in the current year; partially offset by

•An increase in cash provided of $879 million due to Kyndryl distribution to IBM at separation.

Discontinued Operations

Pre-tax income from discontinued operations of $1,744 million in 2021 decreased 18.6 percent compared to the prior year. As the separation of Kyndryl occurred on November 3, 2021, the current year included 10 months of Kyndryl operations compared with a full year in 2020. The current year also included a higher level of separation-related charges. These dynamics were partially offset by higher charges for structural actions in the prior year. The discontinued operations provision for income taxes in 2021 was $714 million compared with $484 million in 2020. The current year provision included tax charges related to the Kyndryl separation. See note C, “Separation of Kyndryl,” for additional information.

Snapshot

In the fourth quarter of 2021, we reported $16.7 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $2.5 billion and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $3.0 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $2.72 as reported and $3.35 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. On a consolidated basis, we generated $2.5 billion in cash from operations, $3.3 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in dividends. These results reflect the strong demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. We continue to invest in skills, innovation and our ecosystem to position us for 2022 and the longer term.

Total revenue increased 6.5 percent as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year with strong performance in our key growth areas of software and consulting. Fourth-quarter 2021 also includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 3.5 points of our total revenue growth. Software increased 8.2 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. Within this segment, Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 7.1 percent (9 percent adjusted for currency), with Red Hat delivering strong double-digit growth. Transaction Processing revenue grew from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl. Consulting increased 13.1 percent as reported and 16 percent adjusted for currency with growth across all business areas. Consulting growth was led by Business Transformation which grew 17.9 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency reflecting strong demand for solutions to transform critical workflows. Infrastructure decreased 0.2 percent as reported but grew 2 percent adjusted

for currency including a benefit from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. Across the segments, total IBM hybrid cloud revenue of $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 grew 16 percent as reported and 18 percent adjusted for currency.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue increased 6.6 percent year to year as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency). EMEA increased 3.6 percent (7 percent adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific increased 10.9 percent year to year as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency).

The gross margin was 56.9 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin was 58.0 percent, both decreasing 2.0 points year to year. Overall, gross margin was impacted by the significant investments we are making to drive our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and a competitive labor market which has impacted labor costs due to higher acquisition, retention and wage costs. 

Total expense and other (income) decreased 19.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the prior-year period primarily driven by a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2020 for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model and improve our position going forward. This decrease was partially offset by increased spending as we continue to invest to drive growth and scale resources to better serve our clients. We are also increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum and expanding our ecosystem. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) decreased 19.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors.

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.9 billion increased $1.9 billion and the pre-tax margin was 17.2 percent, an increase of 10.7 points versus the prior-year period, primarily due to the prior-year workforce rebalancing charge. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 14.2 percent compared to an effective tax rate of (17.3) percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The prior-year tax rate was primarily driven by the geographical mix of pre-tax income, including from structural actions taken in 2020. Net income from continuing operations was $2.5 billion, an increase of 106.9 percent year to year. The net income margin from continuing operations was 14.7 percent, an increase of 7.2 points from the prior-year period.

Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $3.5 billion increased 101.9 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations increased 10.0 points to 21.2 percent, primarily due to the prior-year workforce rebalancing charge. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2021 was 14.2 percent versus 3.7 percent in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by the same factors described above. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $3.0 billion increased 80.0 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 18.2 percent, up 7.4 points year to year.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.72 in the fourth quarter of 2021 increased 106.1 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $3.35 increased 78.2 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2020, respectively.

Results of Continuing Operations

As discussed in the “Organization of Information” section, with the completion of the separation on November 3, 2021, results of Kyndryl are reported as discontinued operations. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in the Management Discussion to allow for a meaningful comparison of continuing operations.

Segment Details

The following is an analysis of the fourth quarter of 2021 versus the fourth quarter of 2020 reportable segment revenue and gross margin results. Segment pre-tax income includes certain limited transactions, predominantly between the Financing and Infrastructure segments, that are recorded to other income and excludes certain unallocated corporate items. Prior-year results have been recast to conform with segment changes effective fourth-quarter 2021.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Recast to reflect segment changes.

Software

Software revenue of $7,273 million increased 8.2 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. Fourth-quarter 2021 includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 5 points of revenue growth. We had double-digit growth in total hybrid cloud revenue within the segment as reported and adjusted for currency. We had continued strength in our Hybrid Platform & Solutions portfolio, led by Red Hat, Automation and Data & AI. Transaction Processing revenue grew in the fourth quarter with all the growth coming from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl. 

Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $5,140 million increased 7.1 percent as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. This revenue performance reflects the strength across the software growth areas that focus on hybrid cloud and AI, and includes incremental revenue in fourth-quarter 2021 from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 1 point of revenue growth. Red Hat revenue grew 18.6 percent as reported (21 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by strong growth in infrastructure and double-digit growth in application development and emerging technologies, as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprises’ critical hybrid cloud requirements. Automation revenue increased 12.8 percent as reported (15 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by good performance in AIOps and management that address resource management and observability, as well as continued growth in Cloud Pak for Integration. Data & AI revenue grew 1.4 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting the strength in Data Fabric which enables clients to connect siloed data that is distributed across a hybrid cloud landscape. Within Data & AI, we also had strong performance in our business analytics and weather offerings. Within Security, although we had growth in the full-year 2021, revenue in the fourth quarter declined 2.3 points as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) driven by lower performance in Data Security. Security innovation is an integral part of our strategy and in the fourth quarter, we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, and acquired ReaQta which leverages AI and machine learning to automatically identify and block threats.

Within Hybrid Platform & Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) increased 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our Hybrid

​

Platform & Solutions business within the Software segment. ARR is calculated by estimating the current quarter’s recurring, committed value for certain types of active contracts as of the period-end date and then multiplying that value by four. This value is based on each arrangement’s contract value and start date, mitigating fluctuations during the contract term, and includes the following consumption models: (1) software subscription agreements, including committed term licenses, (2) as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, (3) maintenance and support contracts, and (4) security managed services contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent the amount of revenue recognized in the period and therefore is not intended to represent current period revenue or revenue that will be recognized in future periods.

Transaction Processing revenue of $2,133 million increased 11.2 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) year to year. Fourth-quarter 2021 includes incremental revenue from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, representing approximately 16 points of revenue growth. In the fourth quarter, we also had some large perpetual license transactions given the expansion in IBM Z capacity driven by the z15 program, as well as strong renewal rates which is proof of our client’s commitment to our infrastructure platform and our high-value software offerings.

Within Software, total hybrid cloud revenue of $2.7 billion grew 22 percent as reported (24 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period reflecting our clients’ demand for our Hybrid Platform & Solutions offerings.

Software gross profit margin of 80.9 percent increased 0.4 points year to year compared to the prior-year period. Pre-tax income of $2,109 million increased 83.2 percent and pre-tax margin increased 11.9 points to 29.0 percent, reflecting the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year which resulted in 9.7 points of improvement on the pre-tax margin.

Consulting

Consulting revenue of $4,746 million increased 13.1 percent as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. We had strong growth year to year in all three business areas, led by Business Transformation, and our book-to-bill ratio was 1.2. We had double-digit growth in total hybrid cloud revenue in the segment as reported and adjusted for currency. Clients are accelerating their business transformations, powered by hybrid cloud and AI, to drive innovation, increase their agility and productivity, and capture new growth opportunities. Enterprises are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner on their transformation journey and are leveraging our deep client, industry and technical expertise, which helps drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. 

Business Transformation revenue of $2,213 million increased 17.9 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency). This business area brings together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. We enable this by leveraging our skills and capabilities in IBM technologies along with our strategic ecosystem partners. Our practices are centered on areas such as finance and supply chain, talent, industry-specific solutions and digital design. This quarter, we had broad-based revenue growth reflecting strong demand for these solutions.

Technology Consulting revenue of $928 million increased 14.4 percent as reported (19 percent adjusted for currency). Technology Consulting architects and implements cloud platforms and strategies, leveraging hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift. In the fourth quarter, we continued to see good performance in application modernization offerings that build cloud native applications as well as modernize existing applications for the cloud.

Application Operations revenue of $1,605 million increased 6.5 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). This business area focuses on application and cloud platform services required to operationalize and run in both cloud and on-premise environments. The growth in fourth-quarter revenue was driven by offerings which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments.

Within Consulting, hybrid cloud revenue of $2.2 billion grew 31 percent as reported (34 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting strong double-digit growth across all three business areas. Consulting Red Hat-related signings more than doubled year to year in the fourth quarter, as we added over 150 engagements in the quarter. Our hybrid cloud revenue from our strategic partnerships grew at a solid double-digit rate in the fourth quarter on a year-to-year basis. 

Consulting fourth-quarter gross profit margin of 27.0 percent decreased 2.7 points year to year. The gross profit margin decline was across all three business areas. We are in a competitive labor market and continued to have increased pressure on labor costs. We expect to capture this increased resource cost in engagements going forward, however, this will take time to be reflected in our future profit profile. Pre-tax income increased $374 million to $436 million and pre-tax margin increased 7.7 points to 9.2 percent compared to the prior-year period. The increase in pre-tax income and margin reflects the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year which resulted in 9.4 points of improvement on the pre-tax margin.

Infrastructure

Infrastructure revenue of $4,414 million decreased 0.2 percent as reported, but increased 2 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. The incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl contributed approximately 5 points of revenue growth in the fourth quarter. By bringing together Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support (formerly Technology Support Services), we can now better manage the lifecycle of our hardware platform and provide end-to-end value for our clients. 

Hybrid Infrastructure revenue of $2,873 million was flat as reported and grew 2 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. In the fourth quarter, the incremental sales from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl contributed approximately 4 points of revenue growth. Distributed Infrastructure grew 4.7 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency, driven primarily by revenue growth across our storage portfolio, partially offset by declines in Power and Cloud IaaS. IBM Z revenue decreased 5.9 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting the z15 product cycle. This was the tenth quarter of z15 availability and the program continues to outpace the strong z14 program with more MIPS shipped than any program in our history. With its combination of security, scalability and reliability, the z15 continues to resonate with our clients, who are leveraging IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. 

Infrastructure Support revenue of $1,541 million decreased 0.9 percent as reported, but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior year. The Infrastructure Support business benefited from our new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, which contributed incremental revenue representing approximately 6 points of revenue growth in the fourth quarter.

Within Infrastructure, hybrid cloud revenue of $1.3 billion decreased 12 percent as reported (11 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by the IBM Z and Distributed Infrastructure product cycles.

The Infrastructure gross profit margin decreased 5.3 points to 54.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to the prior-year period. Pre-tax income of $1,036 million increased 64.6 percent and the pre-tax margin increased 9.2 points year to year to 23.5 percent. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven primarily by declines in margins across the Hybrid Infrastructure product portfolio and margin decline in Infrastructure Support. The increase in pre-tax income and margin reflects the lower workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which resulted in 9.4 points of improvement in the pre-tax margin.

Financing

Financing revenue of $172 million decreased 29.4 percent as reported (29 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, primarily driven by declines in client financing revenue due to a lower average asset balance. Financing's fourth-quarter pre-tax income decreased 27.9 percent to $79 million and the pre-tax margin of 46.0 percent increased 0.9 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was driven by the lower average asset balance noted above which reflects the strategic actions described in Financing’s “Results of Operations.”

Total Expense and Other (Income)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions. 

NM–Not meaningful

Total expense and other (income) decreased 19.4 percent in the fourth quarter with an expense-to-revenue ratio of 39.7 percent compared to 52.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020. The year-to-year decrease was primarily driven by the fourth-quarter 2020 charge for structural actions (18 points), impact of currency (3 points), non-operating Kyndryl-related benefits (1 point) and shared services expense transferred to Kyndryl at separation (1 point), partially offset by higher spending (3 points) and higher non-operating retirement-related costs (1 point). Our expense dynamics reflect a higher level of investment in innovation, skills and our ecosystem, both organically and through acquisitions, as we execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We are aggressively hiring and scaling resources to better serve clients, while increasing our research spend to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas such as quantum, and we are expanding our ecosystem. 

Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other income decreased 19.8 percent year to year, primarily driven by the same factors described above, excluding the non-operating Kyndryl-related benefits and higher non-operating retirement-related costs.

Cash Flow

On a consolidated basis, we generated $2.5 billion in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2021, a decrease of $3.3 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by receivables of $2.5 billion which includes one month of Kyndryl’s results. Net cash used in investing activities of $0.7 billion was $0.1 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($0.4 billion), partially offset by a decrease in cash used for capital expenditures ($0.3 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion decreased $3.6 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower net reductions in debt ($2.8 billion) and net cash proceeds from the Kyndryl distribution to IBM upon separation ($0.9 billion).

Results of Discontinued Operations

Pre-tax income/(loss) from discontinued operations, was a loss of $63 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to income of $354 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. As the separation of Kyndryl occurred on November 3, 2021, the fourth-quarter 2021 included a partial quarter of Kyndryl operations compared with a full quarter in the prior-year period. The current-year period also included a higher level of separation-related charges. These dynamics were partially offset by higher charges for structural actions in the prior-year period. The discontinued operations provision for income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2021 was $66 million compared with $188 million in the prior-year period. The fourth-quarter 2021 provision for income taxes included tax charges related to the Kyndryl separation.

Financial Performance Summary

In 2020, we reported $55.2 billion in revenue and income from continuing operations of $3.9 billion, which included a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions (primarily workforce rebalancing) in the fourth quarter to simplify and optimize our operating model. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings in 2020 were $6.1 billion, which also included the charge for workforce rebalancing. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $4.38 as reported and $6.82 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. On a consolidated basis, we also generated $18.1 billion in cash from operations, $10.8 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $5.8 billion in dividends. With the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainty beginning in March 2020, client priorities shifted to maintaining operational stability, flexibility and preservation of cash. While there was continued demand for offerings that support their digital transformation, clients moved to shorter term duration engagements and prioritized operational expenditures over capital expenditures, which impacted the company’s performance in 2020. However, our results reflected strong performance in hybrid cloud led by Red Hat, gross margin expansion and solid cash generation. We also continued to strengthen our position as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company through strategic organic investments and acquisitions.

Total revenue decreased 4.4 percent as reported and 4.5 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. To provide better transparency on the recurring performance of the ongoing business, total revenue, geographic revenue and hybrid cloud revenue growth rates are provided excluding divested businesses and at constant currency. These divested businesses are included in the category “Other—divested businesses.” Excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency, revenue decreased 2.9 percent. Software revenue increased 2.3 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency, with strong performance from Red Hat, offset by declines in transactional performance in other areas of the portfolio. Software revenue performance was impacted by purchase deferrals, clients opting for shorter duration contracts and preference for operating expenses over capital expenditures. Consulting decreased 4.0 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency with declines due to project delays and less discretionary spending by clients. Infrastructure decreased 7.9 percent year to year as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency primarily due to product cycle dynamics. Across the segments, total IBM hybrid cloud revenue of $16.8 billion in 2020 grew 22 percent as reported (21 percent adjusted for currency) and 24 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 5.5 percent year to year as reported (3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). EMEA decreased 3.0 percent (3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific declined 3.7 percent (3 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency).

The gross margin of 55.9 percent increased 1.3 points year to year, and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 57.3 percent increased 1.7 points versus the prior year, reflecting portfolio mix with strong software contribution and our focus on productivity. 

Total expense and other (income) increased 16.3 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by higher charges for workforce rebalancing, a full year of Red Hat operational spending in 2020 compared to six months in 2019, lower gains from divestitures and higher non-operating retirement-related costs, partially offset by lower spending including reductions in travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.5 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.6 billion decreased 64.3 percent and the pre-tax margin was 4.7 percent, a decrease of 7.8 points versus 2019, primarily due to higher workforce rebalancing charges in 2020, lower gains from divestitures and higher retirement-related costs in the current year. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2020 was (52.9) percent compared to 0.8 percent in 2019. The benefit from income taxes in 2020 was primarily due to the tax impacts of an intra-entity sale of certain of the company’s intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. Net income from continuing operations of $3.9 billion decreased 45.0 percent and the net income from continuing operations margin was 7.1 percent, down 5.3 points year to year, primarily due to the fourth-quarter workforce rebalancing charge. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $5.5 billion decreased 42.1 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 6.5 points to 9.9 percent, reflecting the higher workforce rebalancing charges and lower gains from divestitures in the current year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (11.5) percent compared to 4.0 percent in 2019. The current year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from an intra-entity IP sale in the first quarter. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $6.1 billion decreased 32.7 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 11.1 percent was down 4.7 points year to year. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.38 in 2020 decreased 45.3 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $6.82 decreased 33.0 percent versus 2019, both including a ($1.33) impact from the structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020. 

During 2020, we continued to take actions to further enhance our balance sheet and liquidity position. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $14.3 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion from December 31, 2019. Throughout 2020, we took mitigation actions to preserve liquidity as well as strategic actions to optimize our capital structure, for example, we re-focused our Financing portfolio reducing our external debt needs. We reduced total debt by $1.4 billion from year end 2019 and $11.7 billion since the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat transaction).

Software revenue of $22,927 million increased 2.3 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. There was strong growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, driven primarily by Red Hat, as our hybrid cloud and AI solutions are resonating with clients. Transaction Processing revenue decreased year to year, driven by declines in transactional software performance as clients delayed longer term commitments in 2020 due to the macroeconomic environment.

Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $16,321 million increased 12.8 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by a full year of Red Hat revenue contribution and Red Hat’s strong performance in infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies.

across various clouds within an environment that is open, flexible and secure. Security revenue grew year to year due to good client adoption in security solutions such as Cloud Pak for Security and growth in security services as clients focused on their secure digital transformations. This growth was partially offset by year-to-year declines in Automation and Data & AI as clients deferred transformational investments in 2020 to focus on their core operations.

Transaction Processing revenue of $6,606 million decreased 16.8 percent as reported (17 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. With the macroeconomic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clients focused on near-term priorities resulting in purchase deferrals, which impacted our transactional software performance in 2020. However, our subscription and support revenue grew in 2020 compared to the prior year.

Within Software, hybrid cloud revenue of $6.9 billion grew 69 percent as reported and 68 percent adjusted for currency year to year.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The Software gross profit margin increased 0.4 points to 78.3 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The gross profit margin expansion was driven primarily by the full-year contribution from Red Hat and year-to-year improvement in services margins as we continued to focus on shifting to higher value services, such as Software-as-a-Service and security services, and driving AI-powered automation across the portfolio. Pre-tax income of $3,341 million decreased 33.5 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin decline of 7.8 points to 14.6 percent. The decline in pre-tax income and margin was driven primarily by the decline in transactional software performance in Transaction Processing and our continued investment in strategic areas of hybrid cloud and AI. The decline also reflects the impact of higher workforce rebalancing charges year-to-year which had 3.1 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Consulting[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Consulting revenue of $16,257 million decreased 4.0 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. As the global pandemic intensified through the year, we aligned our offerings to help clients focus on engaging customers virtually, modernizing and migrating applications to the cloud, empowering a remote workforce, and focusing on cybersecurity and IT resiliency. In 2020, Consulting accelerated the number of engagements using Red Hat technology and continued to drive client adoption of Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks.

Business Transformation revenue of $7,193 million decreased 5.0 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. Given the macroeconomic environment during 2020, clients shifted priorities, which led to project delays and less demand for more discretionary offerings. Our cognitive process services (formerly Global Process Services) revenue returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2020, as we continued to deliver efficiency and flexibility to our clients’ processes by infusing innovative technology and redesigning intelligent workflows.

Technology Consulting revenue of $3,133 million increased 11.1 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by growth in higher value offerings to develop and modernize cloud applications. 

Application Operations revenue of $5,931 million decreased 9.4 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting the decline in our traditional on-premises application management services.

The Consulting gross profit margin increased 1.8 points to 29.3 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The gross margin expansion reflects our shift to higher-value offerings, improved productivity and operational efficiency created by our investments in innovative delivery capabilities and our ability to leverage our variable and global delivery resource model. Pre-tax income of $1,034 million decreased 23.0 percent compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin declined 1.6 points to 6.4 percent. The year-to-year declines in pre-tax income and margin were driven by the higher workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which had 2.7 points of impact to pre-tax margin, partially offset by the gross margin expansion.

Infrastructure[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Infrastructure revenue of $14,533 million decreased 7.9 percent year to year as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). Although impacted by product cycles, our Infrastructure solutions continued to deliver critical and lasting value to enterprise clients in support of our hybrid cloud strategy. 

Hybrid Infrastructure revenue of $8,415 million decreased 8.3 percent as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by the decline in Distributed Infrastructure reflecting the Power and Storage product cycles. IBM Z revenue decreased 1.3 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency), driven by a decline in IBM Z operating system software, partially offset by growth in IBM Z hardware reflecting an elongated z15 adoption cycle as a result of the challenging environment. IBM Z continued to offer clients a high-value, secure and scalable platform with cloud native development capabilities.

Infrastructure Support revenue decreased 7.3 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven primarily by the IBM Z and Distributed Infrastructure portfolio product cycles and a shift away from lower value services.

The Infrastructure gross profit margin increased 1.9 points to 57.5 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by margin improvements in Hybrid Infrastructure reflecting margin expansion in IBM Z and Power within Distributed Infrastructure. Pre-tax income of $1,654 million declined 33.3 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 4.3 points year to year to 11.4 percent, driven primarily by the higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the current year, which had 3.4 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Financing[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to conform to 2021 presentation.

​

In 2019, we began the wind down of our OEM Commercial Financing business to refocus our Financing business on IBM’s products and services which completed in early 2021. In 2020, we entered into arrangements to sell certain financing receivables to third parties. While the strategic actions we have taken are the primary driver of the decline in external revenue and pre-tax income on a year-to-year basis, our repositioning of the Financing business has strengthened our liquidity position, improved the quality of our portfolio and lowered our debt needs.

Financing revenue decreased 19.8 percent (19 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by commercial financing which declined $196 million to $45 million and client financing which declined $44 million to $930 million. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in financing revenue was due to a lower average asset balance, primarily driven by the strategic actions described above.

Financing pre-tax income decreased 31.2 percent to $449 million compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin of 46.1 percent decreased 7.6 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit reflecting the strategic actions described above, a decline in internal financing and higher provisions for credit losses in Americas.

Total Expense and Other (Income)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

* Includes a $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter. 

NM–Not meaningful

Total expense and other (income) year-to-year results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the Red Hat acquisition which closed in July 2019. As a result, in 2020, there was a full year of expenses for Red Hat operational spending and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the transaction. Expense in 2020 also included a fourth-quarter $1.5 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions (primarily workforce rebalancing) to simplify and optimize our operating model.

Total expense and other (income) increased 16.3 percent in 2020 versus the prior year, primarily driven by higher Red Hat operational spending, the fourth-quarter charge for workforce rebalancing, lower gains from divestitures and higher non-operating retirement-related costs, partially offset by lower spending including reductions in travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 15.5 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors above excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.

Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 9.8 percent in 2020 versus 2019, driven primarily by the following factors:

•Higher workforce rebalancing charge (9 points); 

•Higher spending (1 point) driven by a full year of Red Hat operational expense in 2020 compared to six months in 2019 (6 points), partially offset by spending reductions associated with COVID-19 restrictions;

•Higher amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction (2 points); partially offset by 

•Lower acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (2 points).

Provisions for expected credit loss expense increased $45.9 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The receivables provision coverage was 2.2 percent at December 31, 2020, an increase of 70 basis points from December 31, 2019. The higher coverage rate at December 31, 2020 also reflects the adoption of the new guidance for current expected credit losses.

RD&E expense increased 5.9 percent in 2020 versus 2019 primarily driven by:

•Higher spending (7 points) driven by a full year of Red Hat spending in 2020 compared to six months in 2019 (8 points); partially offset by

•Lower acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (1 point).

Total intellectual property and custom development income decreased 2.8 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. This was primarily due to a decline in licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees compared to the prior year. The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.

Total other (income) and expense was expense of $802 million in 2020 compared to income of $1,012 million in 2019. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:

•Lower gains from divestitures ($733 million);

•Higher non-operating retirement-related costs ($497 million); 

•Net exchange losses (including derivative instruments) in the current year versus net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) in the prior year ($277 million); and

•Lower interest income ($244 million) driven by lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in the current year.

Interest expense decreased $56 million compared to 2019. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement only if the related external borrowings are to support the Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2020 was $1,738 million, a decrease of $214 million year to year, primarily driven by lower average interest rates. 

Income Taxes

The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2020 was (52.9) percent compared to 0.8 percent in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the company’s intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (11.5) percent compared to 4.0 percent in 2019. The 2020 operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale. For more information, see note H, “Taxes.”

Results of Discontinued Operations

Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $1,658 million in 2020 compared to $2,285 million in 2019, a decrease of 27.4 percent year to year. The decrease was primarily driven by charges for structural actions in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to note C, “Separation of Kyndryl,” for additional information.

Looking Forward

Executing on a Hybrid Cloud & AI Strategy

Over the last year and a half, we have taken a series of significant steps to execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and to improve our revenue profile. Our portfolio, our capital allocation and the actions we have been taking are all designed to “create value through focus” for our clients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders. 

Our most significant portfolio action was the separation of Kyndryl which was completed on November 3. The separation of Kyndryl creates two industry-leading companies, which will continue to have a strong commercial relationship. Both IBM and Kyndryl have increased clarity and ability to focus on their respective operating and financial models, including capital deployment, investment strategies and investment grade capital structures. The separation enables greater freedom of action to partner and capture new opportunities. 

We are building a stronger client-centric culture to drive growth. We have been aggressively hiring with approximately 60 percent of our hires in Consulting. We are scaling resources in garages, client engineering centers and customer success managers, to better serve our clients. We are increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like quantum. We continue to acquire companies that complement and strengthen our portfolio, with a total of 15 acquisitions in 2021. We are increasing investment to expand our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and are simplifying and redesigning our go-to market to better meet client needs, and to execute on our growth agenda. 

We are addressing the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity with a more platform-centric business model. Our new management structure, under our four reportable segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure and Financing, aligns our operating model to our platform-centric approach, reflects a simpler and more streamlined business and provides greater transparency into segment trends. 

Our platform-centric approach is designed to meet clients wherever they are in their digital transformation journey. The hybrid cloud platform we have built is open, secure, and flexible and continues to gain traction in the marketplace. We are seeing high demand for our capabilities in several areas. Across industries, clients see technology as a major source of competitive advantage and are eager to automate as many business tasks as possible. They realize that powerful technologies, embedded at the heart of their business, can lead to seismic shifts in the way they create value and differentiation. They are using AI and predictive capabilities to mitigate friction in their supply chains. Cybersecurity remains a major area of concern as the cost of cybercrime rises each year. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a partner they can trust and who has a proven track record in bringing about strategic transformation projects. There is tremendous opportunity for us to help our clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and AI. This is what we have built our platform for and why we have such confidence in our strategy.

With the actions we have taken to simplify our operating model, the fundamentals of our business model remain solid. Our balance sheet and liquidity position remains strong. At December 31, 2021, we had $7.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities. We have made good progress in deleveraging, while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business or our solid dividend policy. We have reduced our debt by $9.6 billion since the end of 2020 and $21.3 billion from our peak level at June 30, 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). 

We exited 2021 a different company. We have a higher growth and higher value business mix, with over 70 percent of our revenue in software and services, and a significant recurring revenue base, dominated by software. This will result in an improving revenue growth profile, higher operating margin, strong and growing free cash flow and lower capital intensity – leading to a higher return on invested capital business. We are managing for the long-term and are confident in the direction and focus of our business. We expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company with a focus on revenue growth and cash generation while maintaining a strong dividend policy. Our expectations for 2022 are aligned with our mid-term financial model which was previously communicated at our investor briefing on October 4, 2021.

Retirement-Related Plans

The combination of modest returns and higher discount rates improved the overall funded status of our plans. In aggregate, our worldwide-tax qualified plans are funded at 107 percent, with the U.S. at 112 percent. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, approximately flat compared to 2021, of which $0.2 billion generally relates to legally required contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. We expect 2022 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $500 million compared to 2021. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2021. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion in 2022, a decrease of approximately $100 million versus 2021. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.9 billion, a decrease of approximately $400 million compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher income from expected return on assets and lower recognized actuarial losses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $12.8 billion and $18.2 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2019 through 2021.

Cash Flow and Liquidity Trends[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes cash flows of discontinued operations of $1.6 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

** Includes 10 months of Kyndryl operations, and reflects cash paid in 2021 for separation charges and structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020. 

È See note Q, “Borrowings,” for additional information.

In 2021, we continued to actively de-lever our debt, invested $3.3 billion in acquisitions and provided a growing dividend to our shareholders.

On July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. 

The indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.

We are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.

We do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2021, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $162 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

The major ratings agencies ratings on our debt securities at December 31, 2021 were as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

IBM has ample financial flexibility, supported by our strong liquidity position and cash flows, to operate at a single A credit rating. Debt levels have decreased $9.6 billion from December 31, 2020 and $21.3 billion from our peak levels at June 30, 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). 

In July 2017, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), had announced its intent to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. In March 2021, the FCA extended the phase out in the case of U.S. dollar settings for certain tenors until the end of June 2023. During this time, various central bank committees and working groups addressed replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of

different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. Effective December 31, 2021, the use of LIBOR has been substantially eliminated for purposes of any new financial contract executions. Any legacy USD LIBOR based financial contracts are expected to be addressed using the LIBOR rates published through the June 2023 extension period. We have evaluated the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management and internal operational readiness and have monitored the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate. The replacement of the LIBOR benchmark within the company’s risk management activities did not have a material impact in the consolidated financial results. 

We prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 65 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 28. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.

Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Financing receivables.

The following table represents the way in which management reviews cash flow as described below and is presented on a consolidated basis, including cash flows of discontinued operations.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes cash flows of discontinued operations of $1.6 billion, $4.4 billion and $4.5 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

** Includes cash impacts of approximately $1.4 billion for Kyndryl-related structural actions and separation charges.

È Includes the distribution from Kyndryl of $0.9 billion. 

​

From the perspective of how management views cash flow, in 2021, after investing $2.4 billion in capital investments, we generated free cash flow of $6.5 billion. These consolidated results include 10 months of Kyndryl operations, and reflect cash paid in 2021 for separation charges and structural actions initiated in the fourth-quarter 2020. Payments made in 2021 for prior-year taxes that were deferred in relation to COVID-19 government relief programs also contributed to the year to year decline. In 2021, we continued to return value to shareholders including $5.9 billion in dividends. 

IBM’s Board of Directors considers the dividend payment on a quarterly basis. In the second quarter of 2021, the Board of Directors increased the company’s quarterly common stock dividend from $1.63 to $1.64 per share.

Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note S, “Commitments & Contingencies.” With respect to pension funding, in 2021, we contributed $103 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans compared to $189 million in 2020. As highlighted in the Contractual Obligations table, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1.1 billion in the next five years. The 2022 contributions are currently

expected to be approximately $200 million. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, approximately flat compared to 2021. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.

In 2022, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

Our cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities. With our share repurchase program suspended since the close of the Red Hat acquisition, our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our long-standing dividend policy.

Contractual Obligations[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*

Finance lease obligations are presented on a discounted cash flow basis, whereas operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted cash flow basis.

**

As funded status on plans will vary, obligations for mandated minimum pension payments after 2026 could not be reasonably estimated.

È These amounts represent the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that approximately $37 million of the liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. The settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the income tax liability cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing of the payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities; however, it is not expected to be due within the next 12 months.

Certain contractual obligations reported in the previous table exclude the effects of time value and therefore, may not equal the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the previous table as their future cash outflows are uncertain. This includes deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred income, disability benefits and other sundry items. Certain obligations related to our divestitures are included.

Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services (take-or-pay). If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the previous table. If the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation. Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that specify that we will purchase all or a portion of our requirements of a specific product, commodity or service from a supplier or vendor. These contracts are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms. They do not specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and, therefore, we do not consider them to be purchase obligations.

Interest on floating-rate debt obligations is calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2021, plus the interest rate spread associated with that debt, if any.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

From time to time, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67), “Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.”

At December 31, 2021, we had no such off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See the table above for our contractual obligations, and note S, “Commitments & Contingencies,” for detailed information about our guarantees, financial commitments and indemnification arrangements. We do not have retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or other material off-balance sheet interests or instruments.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The application of GAAP requires IBM to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to IBM’s financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of IBM’s Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies are described in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.”

The macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our critical accounting estimates reflected in our 2020 and 2021 results. Given the inherent uncertainty of the magnitude of future impacts from and/or the duration of the pandemic, our estimates may change materially in future periods.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, etc.) are included to allow users of the Annual Report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

Pension Assumptions

For our defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of the benefit obligation to plan participants and net periodic pension (income)/cost requires the use of certain assumptions, including, among others, estimates of discount rates and expected return on plan assets.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the (gain)/loss amortization and interest cost components of the net periodic pension (income)/cost calculation and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The discount rate assumption for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (PPP), a U.S.-based defined benefit plan, increased by 40 basis points to 2.60 percent on December 31, 2021. This change will decrease pre-tax income recognized in 2022 by an estimated $33 million. If the discount rate assumption for the PPP had decreased by 40 basis points on December 31, 2021, pre-tax income recognized in 2022 would increase by an estimated $43 million. Further changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact our funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the PPP’s PBO of an estimated $1.1 billion based upon December 31, 2021 data.

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is used in calculating the net periodic pension (income)/cost. Expected returns on plan assets are calculated based on the market-related value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized over five years in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost and also as a component of actuarial (gains)/losses, which are recognized over the service lives or life expectancy of the participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed thresholds which are based upon the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets, as provided by accounting standards.

To the extent the outlook for long-term returns changes such that management changes its expected long-term return on plan assets assumption, each 50 basis point change in the expected long-term return on PPP plan assets assumption would have an estimated impact of $238 million on the following year’s pre-tax net periodic pension (income)/cost (based upon the PPP’s plan assets at December 31, 2021 and assuming no contributions are made in 2022).

We may voluntarily make contributions or be required, by law, to make contributions to our pension plans. Actual results that differ from the estimates may result in more or less future IBM funding into the pension plans than is planned by management. Impacts of these types of changes on our pension plans in other countries worldwide would vary depending upon the status of each respective plan.

​

​

In addition to the above, we evaluate other pension assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age and mortality, and update these assumptions to reflect experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year can differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.

For additional information on our pension plans and the development of these assumptions, see note W, “Retirement-Related Benefits.”

Revenue Recognition

Application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations. Other significant judgments include determining whether IBM or a reseller is acting as the principal in a transaction and whether separate contracts should be combined and considered part of one arrangement.

Revenue recognition is also impacted by our ability to determine when a contract is probable of collection and to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties and performance bonuses. We consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. If the estimates were changed by 10 percent in 2021, the impact on net income would have been $42 million.

Costs to Complete Service Contracts

We enter into numerous service contracts through our services businesses. During the contractual period, revenue, cost and profits may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate profitability of each contract, especially contracts for which we use cost-to-cost measures of progress. If at any time these estimates indicate the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost. We perform ongoing profitability analyses of these services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. Contract loss provisions recorded as a component of other accrued expenses and liabilities were immaterial at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes.

During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that new information becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies/actions. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

The consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.

To the extent that the provision for income taxes increases/decreases by 1 percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes, consolidated net income would have decreased/improved by $48 million in 2021.

Valuation of Assets

The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired including separately identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions 

​ 
52Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

Valuation of Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We may elect to first assess qualitative risk factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Judgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include entity specific factors, industry and market conditions, legal and regulatory actions, as well as other individual factors impacting each reporting unit such as loss of key personnel and overall financial performance. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if the qualitative assessment indicates it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative test.

In the quantitative test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. Estimating the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach. When circumstances warrant, we may also use a combination of the income approach and certain market approaches.

Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated discounted future cash flows. The discounted cash flow methodology includes the use of projections, which require the use of significant estimates and assumptions specific to the reporting unit as well as those based on general economic conditions. Factors specific to each reporting unit include revenue growth rates, gross margins, discount rates, terminal value growth rates, capital expenditures projections, assumed tax rates and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management.

We perform the annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. In fourth quarter 2021, as a result of the separation of Kyndryl that occurred on November 3, 2021 and the segment changes immediately prior to the separation, we performed the quantitative test for goodwill impairment for all reporting units. 

When estimating the fair value of the Infrastructure Services reporting unit, which included Kyndryl, we applied a weighted average approach utilizing a combination of income and market approaches. Under the market approaches, we estimated the fair value through consideration of market multiples of comparable companies and the market capitalization of Kyndryl. We applied a control premium to these market approaches, which was estimated primarily through consideration of market data for recent comparable transactions. The income approach was used to estimate the fair value of all other reporting units.

The quantitative assessments resulted in no impairment as the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. The Infrastructure Services reporting unit, which contained the future Kyndryl reporting unit and had goodwill of $5.8 billion as of the time of testing, exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 8 percent. Each of the other reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value. Following the changes to the organizational structure, goodwill was reassigned to the new reporting units using a relative fair value allocation approach. As a result, we performed the quantitative test for goodwill impairment for all affected reporting units. The quantitative assessment resulted in no impairment. Goodwill applicable to the Kyndryl business of $5.8 billion was allocated to the Kyndryl reporting unit and was derecognized at the time of the separation. Each of the other reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation, and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Financing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses

The Financing business reviews its financing receivables portfolio on a regular basis in order to assess collectibility and records adjustments to the allowance for credit losses at least quarterly. A description of the methods used by management to estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.” Factors that could result in actual receivable losses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the economic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in Financing’s receivables portfolio.

To the extent that actual collectibility differs from management’s estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, Financing’s segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated $20 million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates.

Residual Value

Residual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates can impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Financing estimates the future

​

fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are periodically reviewed and “other than temporary” declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification. Anticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed.

Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment.

To the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than management’s estimates by 10 percent, Financing’s segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2021 would have been lower by an estimated $35 million. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than management’s estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end of lease when the equipment is remarketed.

Currency Rate Fluctuations

Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. At December 31, 2021, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2020. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.

During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, we may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve our position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to our customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, we believe that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. We also maintain currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which may temporarily mitigate, but not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results.

We translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted our year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in 2021. Based on the currency rate movements in 2021, total revenue increased 3.9 percent as reported and 2.7 percent at constant currency versus 2020. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $70 million in 2021 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $100 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $260 million in 2020 on an as-reported and on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but we believe it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.

For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.

Market Risk

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. In addition to the market risk associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of risk include collectibility of accounts receivable and recoverability of residual values on leased assets.

We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from these risks.

Our debt, in support of the Financing business and the geographic breadth of our operations, contains an element of market risk from changes in interest and currency rates. We manage this risk, in part, through the use of a variety of financial instruments including derivatives, as described in note U, “Derivative Financial Instruments.”

To meet disclosure requirements, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and other financial instruments.

The financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis are comprised of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term and long-term loans, commercial financing and installment payment receivables, investments, long-term and

short-term debt and derivative financial instruments. Our derivative financial instruments generally include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward contracts.

To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market-sensitive instruments. The market values for interest and foreign currency exchange risk are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in rates that are attributable to the market risk being measured. The discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The differences in this comparison are the hypothetical losses associated with each type of risk.

Information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because, due to practical limitations, all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant. In addition, the results of the model are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically excluded from the analysis, while the financial instruments relating to the financing or hedging of those items are included by definition. Excluded items include short-term and long-term receivables from sales-type and direct financing leases, forecasted foreign currency cash flows and the company’s net investment in foreign operations. As a consequence, reported changes in the values of some of the financial instruments impacting the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge.

The results of the sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2021 and 2020, are as follows:

Interest Rate Risk

A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the levels of interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of approximately $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The theoretical changes from the prior year are primarily driven by changes in foreign currency activities related to IBM Financing, as well as long-term debt and derivatives.

Financing Risks

See the “Description of Business” on page 15 for a discussion of the financing risks associated with the Financing business and management’s actions to mitigate such risks.

Cybersecurity

While cybersecurity risk can never be completely eliminated, our approach draws on the depth and breadth of our global capabilities, both in terms of our offerings to clients and our internal approaches to risk management. We offer commercial security solutions that deliver capabilities in areas such as identity and access management, data security, application security, network security and endpoint security. These solutions include pervasive encryption, threat intelligence, analytics, cognitive and artificial intelligence, and forensic capabilities that analyze client security events, yielding insights about attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities facing the client. We also offer professional consulting and technical services solutions for security from assessment and incident response to deployment and resource augmentation. In addition, we offer managed and outsourced security solutions from multiple security operations centers around the world. Finally, security is embedded in a multitude of our products and offerings through secure engineering and operations, and by critical functions (e.g., encryption, access control) in servers, storage, software, services, and other solutions.

From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk-management approach based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to identify and address cybersecurity risks. In addition, we have established policies and procedures that provide the foundation upon which IBM’s infrastructure and data are managed. We regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against cybersecurity attacks and threats on networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data and cloud solutions. We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to mitigate cybersecurity risks. We also have threat intelligence and security monitoring programs, as well as a global incident response process to respond to cybersecurity threats and attacks. In addition, we utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce.

FINANCING

Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Financing facilitates IBM clients' acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has the expertise, while generating solid returns on equity.

Results of Operations

Recast to conform to 2021 presentation.

We have refocused our Financing business on IBM’s products and services. The wind down of our OEM commercial financing operations completed in early 2021. In 2020, we began entering into agreements to sell certain financing receivables to third parties. While these strategic actions impact revenue and pre-tax income on a year-to-year basis, our repositioning of the Financing business has strengthened our liquidity position, improved the quality of our portfolio, and lowered our debt needs.

Financing revenue decreased 20.6 percent (22 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by client financing down $166 million to $763 million and commercial financing down $35 million to $10 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in financing revenue was due to a lower average asset balance, driven by the strategic actions described above.

Financing pre-tax income decreased 1.8 percent to $441 million compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin of 57.0 percent increased 10.9 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit which reflects the strategic actions described above, partially offset by improvements in provisions for credit losses due to the overall improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio year to year as well as lower future funding commitments reserves related to the separation of Kyndryl.

compared to September 30, 2021. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio and reflects mitigating credit enhancement actions taken by the client to reduce the risk to IBM.

We have a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties. These actions may include credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Sale of receivables arrangements are also utilized in the normal course of business as part of our cash and liquidity management. 

The company has entered into agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its client and commercial financing receivables for cash proceeds. Sales of client financing receivables include both loan and lease receivables. In addition, on December 24, 2020, the company entered into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3.0 billion of IBM short-term commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis, starting in the U.S., and Canada in 2020, and expanding to other countries within Europe and Asia Pacific in 2021, including Germany and the UK.

The following table presents the total amount of client and commercial financing receivables transferred:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Calculated based upon an estimated tax rate principally based on Financing’s geographic mix of earnings as IBM’s provision for income taxes is determined on a consolidated basis.

È

Average of the ending equity for Financing for the last five quarters.

Return on equity was 19.3 percent compared to 15.4 percent for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase was driven by a lower average equity balance, which reflects the strategic actions and the overall improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio described in the Financing's "Results of Operations” and "Financial Position" above.

Residual Value

Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business, and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for IBM products. Based upon this product information, Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.

Financing optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients.

Management Responsibility for Financial Information

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. An important element of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program. Our system also contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

To assure the effective administration of internal controls, we carefully select and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and procedures, provide appropriate communication channels and foster an environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of independent, non-management directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent registered public accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder ratification. The Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, with the company’s internal auditors, as well as with IBM management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and financial reporting matters.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit IBM’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Its accompanying report is based on audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
