For further information on sales by customer type, contract type and geographic region, see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to customer concentration.

COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS

We compete with many companies in the defense, intelligence and federal civil markets. The Boeing Company, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon Technologies are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the number of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. government procurement awards).

-5-

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

It is common in the defense industry for work on major programs to be shared among a number of companies. A company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts, or vice versa.

SEASONALITY

No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.

BACKLOG

At December 31, 2021, total backlog, which is equivalent to the company’s remaining performance obligations, was $76.0 billion as compared with $81.0 billion at December 31, 2020. In connection with the IT services divestiture, the company reduced backlog by $1.4 billion during the first quarter of 2021 ($1.0 billion at Defense Systems, $0.2 billion at Mission Systems and $0.2 billion at Space Systems). For further information, see “Backlog” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (MD&A) and Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

We routinely apply for and own a number of U.S. and foreign patents related to the technologies we develop. We also develop and protect intellectual property as trade secrets. In addition to owning a large portfolio of proprietary intellectual property, we license some intellectual property rights to third parties and we license or otherwise obtain access to intellectual property from third parties. The U.S. government typically holds licenses to patents developed in the performance of U.S. government contracts and may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by these patents for certain purposes. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to intellectual property.

RAW MATERIALS

We have experienced challenges with access to certain raw materials due to several global events such as microelectronics shortages and COVID-19. Nonetheless, these challenges have not to date led to significant cost increases or schedule delays. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to raw materials.

HUMAN CAPITAL

Creating a diverse, talented and inclusive workplace is central to our culture, employee engagement, innovation and excellence, and in performing and delivering on our commitments. Our culture is an important factor in our ability to continue attracting and retaining qualified employees, particularly those with security clearances and requisite skills in multiple areas, including science, technology, engineering and math. This focus was a factor in our ability to hire approximately 9,500 new employees in 2021 and as of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 88,000 employees. 

Additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our Sustainability Report and Proxy Statement, which can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our Sustainability Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.

Our Values and Culture

Our values reflect our priorities and form the bedrock of our culture: 

•We do the right thing – we earn trust, act with ethics, integrity and transparency, treat everyone with respect, value diversity and foster safe and inclusive environments.

•We do what we promise – we own the delivery of results, focused on quality.

•We commit to shared success – we work together to focus on the mission and take accountability for the sustainable success of our people, customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities. 

•We pioneer – with fierce curiosity, dedication and innovation, we seek to solve the world’s most challenging problems.

We believe our values are vital to the continued and future success of the company, and in our ability to attract and retain a diverse workforce. Our values are also integral to our commitment to long-term sustainability, with robust environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices across our company. The company has a Standards of Business Conduct program. All employees are empowered to raise concerns without fear of reprisal. We employ 140 business conduct advisors whose job is to promote values and an ethical culture within the company.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

Our annual employee survey gives employees the opportunity to provide feedback on our culture. This survey is managed by a third-party vendor to encourage candor and solicit feedback on many aspects of engagement, including company leadership, culture, inclusion and career development. In 2021, our employee response rate was 82 percent, an indication that our employees believe their feedback is important, and we were named a “High Performing Company” by the third-party vendor based on our strong survey results. Our leaders review the survey feedback and work with their teams to take action based on survey results.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) are, and have long been, critical to our culture and our company’s success. Our focus on DE&I enhances engagement and increases innovation and quality, enabling us to deliver better performance for our shareholders, customers, and employees. Diversity is one of the company’s non-financial ESG performance metrics and is reviewed by the Board of Directors. Across our total employee population, as of December 31, 2021, 25 percent are female, 36 percent are people of color, 18 percent are veterans and 9 percent are persons with disabilities. Over the past 10 years, at the vice president level, we have more than doubled the representation of females from 16 percent to 35 percent and increased the representation of people of color by approximately 65 percent, from 11 percent to 18 percent. 

Talent Acquisition, Management and Development 

We execute our Talent Management strategy with the whole employee experience in mind. We utilize an employee experience continuum that focuses on key career milestones and aligns our employee development, engagement and retention efforts with the specific needs of our employees throughout their careers. We believe this holistic approach to talent management results in a better experience for our employees, from recruiting to retirement.

We hold regular talent review discussions to ensure insight into talent at various levels of the organization. Succession plans are refreshed and reviewed to ensure a robust, diverse pipeline of talent and business continuity with a tight linkage to development. 

We design our employee development programs to strengthen employee skills aligned to our current and future business needs, encourage knowledge transfer and support career growth and progression. In late 2020, we launched My Learning Experience, a machine learning enabled content aggregator designed to create a unique and personalized learning experience for each employee. We offer our employees online career-specific tools and resources and we also support development opportunities through educational institutions with our Education Assistance Program. Our early-in-career rotation program, Pathways, develops talent pipelines with both depth of skills and breadth of experiences that are critical to the company’s future talent needs. Our technical cohort programs are designed to cultivate technical, domain expertise and collaborative thought leadership for early through advanced career levels.

As our company continues to grow, we rely on an integrated talent acquisition program. The company strategically attracts, identifies, and onboards candidates in support of business needs and priorities. In order to accomplish our goals, we seek talent with different perspectives, skills and experiences; maintain strategic relationships with colleges; offer a robust employee referral program; and partner with numerous diversity organizations, military organizations and our trusted external partners. The company continues to monitor the evolving hiring environment, while applying agile recruiting methods to ensure employees and candidates have an exceptional experience.

Employee Health and Safety

People are our most valuable resource, and we work diligently to protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, customers, visitors and others at our facilities. During 2021, we have taken, and continue to take, robust actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees and others. See “COVID-19” in MD&A for further discussion. 

Health and safety are a core focus in everything we do. Risk and hazard identification, abatement and prevention are key components of Northrop Grumman’s safety program. Everyone has a responsibility to identify workplace hazards and we empower employees to report these hazards without fear of repercussion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our health and safety programs externally, through benchmarking with industry peers and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Internally, we determine program effectiveness by conducting trend analyses of our past performance. 

Collective Agreements 

Approximately 3,900 employees are covered by 15 collective agreements in the U.S., of which we negotiated five renewals in 2021 and expect to negotiate four renewals in 2022. 

See “Risk Factors” for further discussion regarding risks related to our workforce and employee relations.

REGULATORY MATTERS

Government Contract Security Restrictions

We are prohibited by the U.S. government from publicly discussing the details of certain classified programs. These programs are generally referred to as “restricted” in this Annual Report. The consolidated financial statements and financial information in this Annual Report reflect the operating results of our entire company, including restricted programs.

Contracts

We generate the majority of our business from long-term contracts with the U.S. government for development, production and support activities. Unless otherwise specified in a contract, allowable and allocable costs are billed to contracts with the U.S. government pursuant to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which are regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts. Examples of costs incurred by us and not billed to the U.S. government in accordance with applicable FAR and CAS requirements include, but are not limited to, unallowable employee compensation, charitable donations, interest expense, advertising and certain legal costs.

We monitor our contracts on a regular basis for compliance with our policies and procedures and applicable government laws and regulations. In addition, costs incurred and allocated to contracts with the U.S. government are routinely audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA).

Our long-term contracts typically fall into one of two contract types:

Cost-type contracts – Cost-type contracts include cost plus fixed fee, cost plus award fee and cost plus incentive fee contracts. Cost-type contracts generally provide for reimbursement of a contractor’s allowable costs incurred plus fee. As a result, cost-type contracts have less financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth but generally provide lower profit margins than fixed-price contracts. Cost-type contracts typically require that the contractor use its best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within some specified time and stated dollar limitation. Fees on cost-type contracts can be fixed in terms of dollar value or can be variable due to award and incentive fees, which are generally based on performance criteria such as cost, schedule, quality and/or technical performance. Award fees are determined and earned based on customer evaluation of the company’s performance against contractual criteria. Incentive fees are generally based on cost or schedule and provide for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later, based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs or as schedule milestones are met. Award and incentive fees are included in total estimated sales to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We estimate variable consideration as the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled.

Fixed-price contracts – Firm fixed-price contracts include a specified scope of work for a price that is a pre-determined, negotiated amount and not generally subject to adjustment regardless of costs incurred by the contractor, absent changes in scope by the customer. As a result, fixed-price contracts have more financial risk associated with unanticipated cost growth, but generally provide the opportunity for higher profit margins than cost-type contracts. Certain fixed-price incentive fee contracts provide for reimbursement of the contractor’s allowable costs plus a fee up to a cost ceiling amount, typically through a cost-sharing ratio that affects profitability. These contracts effectively become firm fixed-price contracts once the cost-share ceiling is reached. Time-and-materials contracts are considered fixed-price contracts as they specify a fixed hourly rate for each labor hour charged.

Profit margins on our contracts may vary materially depending on, among other things, the contract type, contract phase (e.g., development, low-rate production or mature production), negotiated fee arrangements, achievement of performance objectives, and cost, schedule and technical performance.

See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and “Risk Factors” for further information regarding our contracts and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for sales by contract type.

NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION

The following table summarizes sales for the year ended December 31, 2021, recognized by contract type and customer category:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Sales to the U.S. government include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is the U.S. government. Each of the company’s segments derives substantial revenue from the U.S. government. 

(2) International sales include sales from contracts for which we are the prime contractor, as well as those for which we are a subcontractor and the ultimate customer is an international customer. These sales include foreign military sales contracted through the U.S. government. 

Environmental

Our operations are subject to and affected by federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and enforcement actions relating to protection of the environment. In 2015, we announced our 2020 environmental sustainability goals: to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent from 2010 levels; to reduce potable water use by 20 percent from 2014 levels; and to achieve a 70 percent solid waste diversion rate (away from landfills). In 2021, we measured our performance against these goals and exceeded our greenhouse gas goal by reducing emissions 44 percent and met our potable water reduction goal of 20 percent. We made strong progress in increasing our solid waste diversion from landfills, achieving a 69 percent diversion rate, falling just short of our goal. We were challenged by changes in collection methods and waste haulers at some sites, related, in some cases, to COVID-19. We are continuing our commitment to climate and environmental sustainability and are in the process of finalizing the next generation of goals for 2022 and beyond.

We have incurred and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our environmental sustainability commitments. See “Risk Factors” and Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding environmental matters.
