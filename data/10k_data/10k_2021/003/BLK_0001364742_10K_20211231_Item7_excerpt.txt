Overview  

BlackRock, Inc. (together, with its subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is a leading publicly traded investment management firm with $10.01 trillion of AUM at December 31, 2021. With approximately 18,400 employees in more than 30 countries, BlackRock provides a broad range of investment and technology services to institutional and retail clients in more than 100 countries across the globe. For further information see Note 1, Business Overview, and Note 26, Segment Information, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8.  

The following discussion includes a comparison of BlackRock’s results for 2021 and 2020. For a discussion of BlackRock’s results for 2019 and a comparison of results for 2020 and 2019, see Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021. 

Certain prior period presentations and disclosures, while not required to be recast, were reclassified to ensure comparability with current period classifications. 

Acquisition 

On February 1, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Aperio Group, LLC (the “Aperio Transaction” or “Aperio”), a pioneer in customizing tax-optimized index equity separately managed accounts (“SMAs”) for approximately $1.1 billion in cash, using existing cash resources. The acquisition of Aperio increased BlackRock’s SMA AUM and expanded the breadth of the Company’s capabilities via tax-managed strategies across factors, broad market indexing, and investor Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) preferences across all asset classes.

Business Outlook  

BlackRock’s strategy continues to be guided by the Company's purpose and focus on the long-term, which the Company believes better enables it to deliver durable returns for shareholders and create value for all of its stakeholders. 

BlackRock's framework for long-term shareholder value creation is predicated on generating differentiated organic growth, leveraging scale to increase operating margins over time, and returning capital to shareholders on a consistent basis. BlackRock's diversified platform, in terms of style, product, client and geography, enables it to generate more stable cash flows through market cycles, positioning BlackRock to invest for the long-term by striking an appropriate balance between investing for future growth and prudent discretionary expense management. 

BlackRock continues to actively monitor COVID-19 developments and their potential impact on the Company’s employees, business and operations, particularly in jurisdictions where BlackRock has significant employee populations and/or business activity. The aggregate extent to which COVID-19, including existing and new variants and its related impact on the global economy, affects BlackRock’s business, results of operations and financial condition, will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and any recovery period, the emergence and spread of variants of the COVID-19 virus, the continuing prevalence of severe, unconstrained and/or escalating rates of infection in certain countries and regions, and the availability, adoption and efficacy of treatments and vaccines and future actions taken by governmental authorities, central banks and other third parties in response to the pandemic. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors herein for information on the possible future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s results. 

In addition, BlackRock’s business may be impacted by governmental changes, as well as potential regulations, foreign and trade policies and fiscal spending that may arise as a result of such changes.  

BlackRock’s investment management revenue is primarily comprised of fees earned as a percentage of AUM and, in some cases, performance fees, which are normally expressed as a percentage of fund returns to the client. Numerous factors, including price movements in the equity, debt or currency markets, or in the price of real assets, commodities or alternative investments in which BlackRock invests on behalf of clients, and BlackRock’s ability to maintain strong investment performance, could impact BlackRock’s AUM, revenue and earnings.  

During 2021, BlackRock voluntarily waived a portion of its management fees on certain money market funds to ensure that they maintained a minimum level of daily net investment income. These waivers resulted in a reduction of management fees of approximately $500 million in 2021, a portion of which was partially offset by a reduction of BlackRock’s distribution and servicing costs paid to financial intermediaries. BlackRock has provided voluntary yield support waivers in prior periods and may increase or decrease the level of fee waivers in future periods. Given the current prospects for higher rates in the near term, we anticipate most of these waivers would cease shortly after the first 25 basis point increase in the Federal Funds rate, however approximately 50% of these gross fee waivers are generally shared with distributors, reducing the impact on operating income. 

In recent years, there have been prolonged periods of historically low interest rates, interspersed with periods in which certain central banks globally began increasing rates. BlackRock’s business is directly and indirectly affected by changes in global interest rates. Changes in global interest rates may cause BlackRock’s AUM to fluctuate and introduce volatility to the Company’s base fees, net income and operating cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors herein for information on the possible future effects of changes in global interest rates on the Company's results. 

BlackRock manages $2.8 trillion in fixed income assets, two-thirds of which are owned by institutions for strategic or liability-matching purposes. BlackRock believes it is well positioned for a rising rate environment due to the breadth, diversification and performance of its fixed income platform which encompasses active, ETF and non-ETF index fixed income products, and a range of strategies, including unconstrained, high yield, total return and short-duration. 

BlackRock manages $5.3 trillion of equity assets across markets globally. Beta divergence between equity markets, where certain markets perform differently than others, may lead to an increase in the proportion of BlackRock AUM weighted toward lower fee equity products, resulting in a decline in BlackRock’s effective fee rate. Divergent market factors may also erode the correlation between the growth rates of AUM and investment advisory and administration fees (collectively “base fees”) and securities lending revenue. 

BlackRock’s highly diversified multi-product platform was created to meet client needs in all market environments. BlackRock is positioned to provide alpha-seeking active, index and cash management investment strategies across asset classes and geographies. In addition, BlackRock leverages its world-class risk management, analytics and technology capabilities, including the Aladdin platform, on behalf of clients. BlackRock serves a diverse mix of institutional and retail clients across the globe, including investors in ETFs, maintaining differentiated client relationships and a fiduciary focus. The diversity of BlackRock’s platform facilitates the generation of organic growth in various market environments, and as client preferences evolve. BlackRock’s long-term strategy remains to keep alpha at the heart of BlackRock; accelerate growth in ETFs, illiquid alternatives, and technology; deliver whole portfolio solutions and become the global leader in sustainable investing. 

BlackRock is a $2.6 trillion active manager and multi-year investments in incorporating data science, sustainability and new tools for portfolio construction resulted in record organic growth in active strategies in 2021. BlackRock’s active platform reflects global reach, interconnectivity across teams and regions, growing data and insights, integrated technology and risk management and scalable processes – all of which the Company believes enables it to deliver more consistent outcomes for clients over the long-term. 

The index investing industry has been growing rapidly – with ETFs as a major beneficiary – driven by structural tailwinds including the migration from commission-based to fee-based wealth management, growth in model portfolios, clients’ focus on value for money, the use of ETFs as alpha tools and the modernization of the bond market. BlackRock’s ETF growth strategy is centered on increasing scale and pursuing global growth themes in client and product segments, including Core, Strategic, which includes Fixed Income, Factors, Sustainable and Thematic ETFs, and Precision Exposures.  

Clients are also increasing their allocations to private markets as they search for diversification and higher returns. BlackRock has built a broad illiquid alternatives platform with $102.6 billion of AUM across infrastructure, private credit, real estate and private equity to meet this demand. As of December 31, 2021, BlackRock has approximately $36 billion of committed capital to deploy for institutional clients in a variety of alternatives strategies, and remains confident in its ability to accelerate growth as a leader in private markets. BlackRock also manages $87.3 billion in liquid alternatives, as well as $103.9 billion in liquid credit strategies, included within fixed income AUM. 

36 

BlackRock continues to invest in technology services offerings, which enhance the ability to manage portfolios and risk, effectively serve clients and operate efficiently. Anticipated industry consolidation and regulatory requirements should continue to drive demand for holistic and flexible technology solutions. BlackRock is focused on enhancing Aladdin, with continued investment into areas such as whole portfolio, private markets, wealth and a leading sustainable investing solution. BlackRock is also investing to scale Aladdin for its next leg of growth by migrating Aladdin from BlackRock-hosted data centers to the cloud. This will bring enhanced capabilities to BlackRock and its Aladdin clients, accelerating innovation and supporting greater computing scale and flexibility for clients. Through this migration as well as BlackRock’s strategic partnership with Snowflake, an industry-leader in cloud enabled data technology, the Company is building Aladdin Data Cloud, a next generation solution that will bring Aladdin and non-Aladdin data together, so clients can nimbly access and use data across their organization unlocking their full potential for collaboration, creativity, and innovation. 

As the asset management landscape shifts globally from individual product selection to a whole-portfolio approach, BlackRock’s strategy is focused on creating outcome-oriented client solutions for both retail investors and institutions. This includes having a diverse platform of alpha-seeking active, index and alternative products, as well as enhanced distribution and portfolio construction technology offerings. Digital wealth tools are an important component of BlackRock’s retail strategy, as BlackRock scales and customizes model portfolios, extends Aladdin Wealth and digital wealth partnerships globally, and helps advisors build better portfolios through portfolio construction and risk management, powered by Aladdin. BlackRock has seen strong momentum in OCIO solutions among institutional clients, including the funding of several significant mandates in 2021, and anticipates continued OCIO opportunities in the future. 

Across BlackRock, more clients are focusing on the impact of sustainability on their portfolios. This shift has been driven by an increased understanding of how sustainability-related factors can affect economic growth, asset values, and financial markets as a whole. As a fiduciary, BlackRock is committed to helping clients build more resilient portfolios. Since sustainable investment options have the potential to offer clients better outcomes, the Company is making sustainability integral to the way BlackRock manages risk, constructs portfolios, designs products, and engages with companies. Over the past several years, BlackRock has been deepening the integration of sustainability into technology, risk management, and product choice across BlackRock, and plans to accelerate those efforts.

Executive Summary  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures.  

(2)  

Total BlackRock stockholders’ equity, divided by total shares outstanding at December 31 of the respective year-end.  

2021 Compared with 2020 

GAAP. Operating income of $7,450 million increased $1,755 million and operating margin of 38.5% increased 340 bps from 2020. Increases in operating income and operating margin reflected the impact of $589 million related to the previously reported charitable contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac Financial Services, Inc. (the “Charitable Contribution”) during 2020. Operating income and operating margin also reflected higher base fees and technology services revenue, partially offset by higher expense, including higher compensation and benefits expense, and higher product launch costs in 2021. Product launch costs in 2021 included $178 million associated with the March 2021 close of the $4.9 billion BlackRock Innovation and Growth Trust and $99 million primarily associated with the September 2021 close of the BlackRock ESG Capital Allocation Trust. Product launch costs in 2020 included $87 million and $83 million associated with the close of the $2.3 billion BlackRock Health Sciences Trust II and the $2 billion BlackRock Capital Allocation Trust, respectively. Operating income and operating margin also reflected $28 million of noncash occupancy expense related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York (“Lease cost – Hudson Yards”), which it expects to begin to occupy in late 2022 (and begin lease payments in May 2023).  

Nonoperating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to NCI decreased $56 million from 2020, reflecting the impact of a pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital and $122 million pre-tax gain related to the Charitable Contribution during 2020, partially offset by the impact of non-cash gains related to iCapital and Scalable Capital and higher net unrealized gains on the Company’s private equity co-investment portfolio during 2021.  

Income tax expense for 2021 reflected a $126 million noncash net expense related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, as a result of legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2021 also reflected $43 million of discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards. Income tax expense for 2020 included a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution, partially offset by a noncash net expense of approximately $79 million associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to the legislation enacted in the UK increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. Income tax expense for 2020 also included $139 million of net discrete tax benefits, including benefits related to changes in the Company’s organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards.  

Diluted earnings per common share increased $6.37, or 20%, from 2020, reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution incurred in 2020. The increase in earnings per diluted common share also included higher revenue, partially offset by higher product launch costs, lower nonoperating income, and a higher effective tax rate in 2021.  

As Adjusted. Operating income of $7,478 million increased $1,194 million and operating margin of 45.2% increased 30 bps from 2020. Diluted earnings per common share increased $5.36, or 16%, from 2020, primarily due to higher operating and nonoperating income, partially offset by higher effective tax rate in 2021. The financial impact related to Lease cost – Hudson Yards and the Charitable Contribution and the noncash net tax expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities described above has been excluded from as adjusted results. 

See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items.  

For further discussion of BlackRock’s revenue, expense, nonoperating results and income tax expense, see Discussion of Financial Results herein. 

38 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and considers them to be helpful, for both management and investors, in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance over time. Management also uses non-GAAP financial measures as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies and to enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented. Non-GAAP measures may pose limitations because they do not include all of BlackRock’s revenue and expense. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. 

Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating BlackRock’s financial performance. Adjustments to GAAP financial measures (“non-GAAP adjustments”) include certain items management deems nonrecurring or that occur infrequently, transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.  

Computations for all periods are derived from the consolidated statements of income as follows:  

(1) Operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Management believes operating income, as adjusted, and operating margin, as adjusted, are effective indicators of BlackRock’s financial performance over time and, therefore, provide useful disclosure to investors. Management believes that operating margin, as adjusted, reflects the Company’s long-term ability to manage ongoing costs in relation to its revenues. The Company uses operating margin, as adjusted, to assess the Company’s financial performance and to determine the long-term and annual compensation of the Company’s senior-level employees. Furthermore, this metric is used to evaluate the Company’s relative performance against industry peers, as it eliminates margin variability arising from the accounting of revenues and expenses related to distributing different product structures in multiple distribution channels utilized by asset managers. 

•  

Operating income, as adjusted, includes non-GAAP expense adjustments. In 2021, the Company recorded expense related to the Lease cost – Hudson Yards. While the Company expects to begin to occupy the new office space in late 2022 (and begin cash lease payments in May 2023), the Company is required to record lease expense from August 2021 because it obtained access to the building to begin its tenant improvements. As a result, the Company is recognizing lease expense for both its current and future headquarters until its current headquarters lease expires in April 2023. Management believes removing the Lease cost – Hudson Yards when calculating operating income, as adjusted, is useful to assess its financial performance and enhances comparability among periods presented. In 2020, the Charitable Contribution expense of $589 million has been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature. 

•  

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of product launch costs (e.g. closed-end fund launch costs) and related commissions. Management believes the exclusion of such costs and related commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenue associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact BlackRock’s results until future periods. 

•  

Revenue used for calculating operating margin, as adjusted, is reduced to exclude all of the Company’s distribution fees, which are recorded as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of income, as well as a portion of investment advisory fees received that is used to pay distribution and servicing costs. For certain products, based on distinct arrangements, distribution fees are collected by the Company and then passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. For other products, investment advisory fees are collected by the Company and a portion is passed-through to third-party client intermediaries. However, in both structures, the third-party client intermediary similarly owns the relationship with the retail client and is responsible for distributing the product and servicing the client. The amount of distribution and investment advisory fees fluctuates each period primarily based on a predetermined percentage of the value of AUM during the period. These fees also vary based on the type of investment product sold and the geographic location where it is sold. In addition, the Company may waive fees on certain products that could result in the reduction of payments to the third-party intermediaries. 

39 

(2) Nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating contribution to its results and provides comparability of this information among reporting periods. Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impact BlackRock’s book value. In 2020, the noncash, nonoperating pre-tax gain of $122 million related to the Charitable Contribution has been excluded from nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, due to its nonrecurring nature. 

(3) Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Management believes net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant nonrecurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow. 

See notes (1) and (2) above regarding operating income, as adjusted, operating margin, as adjusted, and nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted for information on the Lease cost – Hudson Yards and the Charitable Contribution. 

In 2020, a discrete tax benefit of $241 million was recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution. The discrete tax benefit has been excluded from as adjusted results due to the nonrecurring nature of the Charitable Contribution. The amounts for 2021 and 2020 income tax matters included $126 million and $79 million, respectively, of net noncash expense related to the impact of legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. These amounts have been excluded from the as adjusted results as these items will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented. 

Per share amounts reflect net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted divided by diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding.

AUM increased $1.33 trillion to $10.01 trillion at December 31, 2021 from $8.68 trillion at December 31, 2020 driven primarily by net market appreciation, positive net flows across all investment styles and product types, and AUM added from the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange movements. 

Net market appreciation of $864.1 billion was driven primarily by higher global equity markets. 

AUM decreased $111.6 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the strengthening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound.

Net market appreciation of $746.3 billion was driven primarily by higher global equity and fixed income markets. 

AUM increased $109.9 billion due to the impact of foreign exchange movements, primarily due to the weakening of the US dollar, largely against the Euro, the British pound, and the Japanese yen.

Discussion of Financial Results  

Introduction  

The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees, which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. Net inflows or outflows represent the sum of new client assets, additional fundings from existing clients (including dividend reinvestment), withdrawals of assets from, and termination of, client accounts and distributions to investors representing return of capital and return on investments to investors. Market appreciation or depreciation includes current income earned on, and changes in the fair value of, securities held in client accounts. Foreign exchange translation reflects the impact of translating non-US dollar denominated AUM into US dollars for reporting purposes.  

The Company also earns revenue by lending securities on behalf of clients, primarily to highly rated banks and broker-dealers. The securities loaned are secured by collateral in the form of cash or securities, with minimum collateral generally ranging from approximately 102% to 112% of the value of the loaned securities. Generally, the revenue earned is shared between the Company and the funds or accounts managed by the Company from which the securities are borrowed.  

Investment advisory agreements for certain separate accounts and investment funds provide for performance fees based upon relative and/or absolute investment performance, in addition to base fees based on AUM. Investment advisory performance fees generally are earned after a given period of time and when investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold. As such, the timing of recognition of performance fees may increase the volatility of the Company’s revenue and earnings. The magnitude of performance fees can fluctuate quarterly due to the timing of carried interest recognition on illiquid alternative products and a greater number and size of liquid products with performance measurement periods that end in the third and fourth quarters.  

The Company offers investment management technology systems, risk management services, wealth management and digital distribution tools, all on a fee basis. Clients include banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers, retail distributors and other investors. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform, or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights. 

The Company earns distribution and service fees for distributing investment products and providing support services to investment portfolios. The fees are based on AUM and are recognized when the amount of fees is known. 

The Company advises global financial institutions, regulators, and government entities across a range of risk, regulatory, capital markets and strategic services. Fees earned for advisory services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are determined using fixed-rate fees and are recognized over time as the related services are completed.  

The Company earns fees for transition management services primarily comprised of commissions recognized in connection with buying and selling securities on behalf of its customers. Commissions related to transition management services, which are included in advisory and other revenue, are recorded on a trade-date basis as transactions occur.  

The Company also earns revenue related to certain minority investments accounted for as equity method investments.  

Operating expense reflects employee compensation and benefits, distribution and servicing costs, direct fund expense, general and administration expense and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets.  

•  

Employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries, commissions, temporary help, deferred and incentive compensation, employer payroll taxes, severance and related benefit costs.  

•  

Distribution and servicing costs, which are primarily AUM driven, include payments to third parties, primarily associated with distribution and servicing of client investments in certain Company products.  

•  

Direct fund expense primarily consists of third-party nonadvisory expenses incurred by the Company related to certain funds for the use of index trademarks, reference data for indices, custodial services, fund administration, fund accounting, transfer agent services, shareholder reporting services, legal expense, and audit and tax services as well as other fund-related expenses directly attributable to the nonadvisory operations of the fund. These expenses may vary over time with fluctuations in AUM, number of shareholder accounts, or other attributes directly related to volume of business.  

•  

General and administration expense includes marketing and promotional (including travel and entertainment expense), occupancy and office-related costs, portfolio services (including clearing expense related to transition management services, sub-advisory expenses and market data costs), technology, professional services, communications, contingent consideration fair value adjustments, product launch costs, the net impact of foreign currency remeasurement, and other general and administration expense. Foreign currency remeasurement losses were $4 million and $6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Approximately 75% of the Company’s revenue is generated in US dollars. The Company’s revenue and expense generated in foreign currencies (primarily the Euro and British pound) are impacted by foreign exchange rates. Any effect of foreign exchange rate change on revenue is partially offset by a change in expense driven by the Company’s considerable non-dollar expense base related to its operations outside the United States.  

Nonoperating income (expense) includes the effect of changes in the valuations on investments and earnings on equity method investments as well as interest and dividend income and interest expense. The Company primarily holds seed and co-investments in sponsored investment products that invest in a variety of asset classes, including private equity, hedge funds and real assets. Investments generally are made for co-investment purposes, to establish a performance track record or for regulatory purposes, including Federal Reserve Bank stock. The Company does not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of its clients.  

In addition, nonoperating income (expense) includes the impact of changes in the valuations of consolidated sponsored investment products (“CIPs”). The portion of nonoperating income (expense) not attributable to the Company is allocated to NCI on the consolidated statements of income.

Amounts include commodity ETFs. 

47 

Revenue increased $3,169 million, or 20%, from 2020, primarily driven by higher base and performance fees and continued growth in technology services revenue. 

Investment advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue of $15,260 million in 2021 increased $2,621 million from $12,639 million in 2020, primarily driven by the positive impact of market beta and foreign exchange movements on average AUM and strong organic base fee growth, partially offset by the impact of yield-related fee waivers on certain money market funds and strategic pricing changes to certain products, and lower securities lending revenue. Securities lending revenue of $555 million decreased $97 million from $652 million in 2020, primarily reflecting lower asset spreads, partially offset by higher average balances of securities on loan.  

Investment advisory performance fees of $1,143 million in 2021 increased $39 million from $1,104 million in 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from illiquid alternative and long-only equity products, partially offset by lower revenue from liquid alternative products.  

Technology services revenue of $1,281 million for 2021 increased $142 million from $1,139 million in 2020, primarily reflecting higher revenue from Aladdin. 

Advisory and other revenue of $169 million in 2021 decreased $23 million from $192 million in 2020, primarily reflecting the impact of the Charitable Contribution of BlackRock’s remaining 20% stake in PennyMac in 2020 and lower earnings from a strategic minority investment. 

Expense  

The following table presents expense for 2021 and 2020.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Expense increased $1,414 million, or 13%, from 2020, primarily driven by higher general and administration expense, including the impact of higher product launch costs, higher employee compensation and benefits expense, and higher volume-related expense in 2021, partially offset by the impact of the Charitable Contribution in 2020. 

Employee compensation and benefits expense increased $1,002 million, or 20%, to $6,043 million in 2021 from $5,041 million in 2020, primarily reflecting higher base compensation, driven by previously announced base salary increases and higher headcount, and higher deferred compensation, reflecting the impact of additional grants associated with prior-year compensation.  

Direct fund expense increased $250 million from 2020, reflecting higher average AUM. 

General and administration expense decreased $244 million from 2020, largely driven by $589 million of expense related to the Charitable Contribution recorded in 2020. General and administration expense also reflected higher expense during 2021 primarily related to technology expense, product launch costs, portfolio services expense, and occupancy expense, including the impact of Lease cost – Hudson Yards described above, and higher contingent consideration fair value adjustments, partially offset by the impact of costs related to certain legal matters incurred during 2020. The financial impact related to the Charitable Contribution and Lease cost – Hudson Yards has been excluded from as adjusted results. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on as adjusted items. 

Amortization of intangible assets expense increased $41 million from 2020, primarily reflecting amortization of intangible assets related to the Aperio Transaction.

Nonoperating Results  

The summary of nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI for 2021 and 2020 was as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI.  

(2)  

Management believes nonoperating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s nonoperating results, which ultimately impacts BlackRock’s book value. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for further information on non-GAAP financial measures.  

(3)  

Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to direct hedge fund strategies and hedge fund solutions.  

(4)  

Amounts primarily include net gains (losses) related to unhedged equity, fixed income and multi-asset seed investments.  

(5)  

The amount for 2021 includes nonoperating noncash pre-tax gains in connection with strategic minority investments in iCapital Network, Inc. of approximately $119 million and Scalable Capital Limited of approximately $46 million. Amount for 2020 includes a nonoperating pre-tax gain of approximately $240 million in connection with a recapitalization of iCapital. Additional amounts include noncash pre-tax gains (losses) related to the revaluation of certain other corporate minority investments. 

Income Tax Expense  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

As adjusted items are described in more detail in Non-GAAP Financial Measures. 

(2)  

Net of net income (loss) attributable to NCI. 

The Company’s tax rate is affected by tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amount of income earned in those jurisdictions, which the Company expects to be fairly consistent in the near term. The significant foreign jurisdictions that have different statutory tax rates than the US federal statutory rate of 21% include the United Kingdom, Germany, Canada, and Netherlands.  

2021 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: 

o  

a $126 million net noncash expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes; and 

o  

a discrete tax benefit of $43 million, related to stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2021. 

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 23.4% for 2021 excluded the $126 million noncash deferred tax revaluation noncash expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.  

2020 Income tax expense (GAAP) reflected: 

o  

a discrete tax benefit of $241 million recognized in connection with the Charitable Contribution;  

o  

a discrete tax benefit of $139 million, including benefits related to changes in the Company’s organizational entity structure and stock-based compensation awards that vested in 2020; and 

o  

a $79 million net noncash expense associated with the revaluation of certain deferred income tax assets and liabilities related to legislation enacted in the United Kingdom increasing its corporate tax rate and state and local income tax changes. 

The as adjusted effective tax rate of 21.1% for 2020 excluded the $241 million discrete tax benefit in connection with the Charitable Contribution due to its nonrecurring nature and the $79 million noncash deferred tax revaluation noncash expense mentioned above as it will not have a cash flow impact and to ensure comparability among periods presented.

Statement of financial condition Overview 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statement of financial condition presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statement of financial condition, excluding the impact of separate account assets and separate account collateral held under securities lending agreements (directly related to lending separate account securities) and separate account liabilities and separate account collateral liabilities under securities lending agreements and CIPs.  

The Company presents the as adjusted balance sheet as additional information to enable investors to exclude certain assets that have equal and offsetting liabilities or NCI that ultimately do not have an impact on stockholders’ equity or cash flows. Management views the as adjusted statement of financial condition, which contains non-GAAP financial measures, as an economic presentation of the Company’s total assets and liabilities; however, it does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

Separate Account Assets and Liabilities and Separate Account Collateral Held under Securities Lending Agreements  

Separate account assets are maintained by BlackRock Life Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company that is a registered life insurance company in the UK, and represent segregated assets held for purposes of funding individual and group pension contracts. The Company records equal and offsetting separate account liabilities. The separate account assets are not available to creditors of the Company and the holders of the pension contracts have no recourse to the Company’s assets. The net investment income attributable to separate account assets accrues directly to the contract owners and is not reported on the consolidated statements of income. While BlackRock has no economic interest in these assets or liabilities, BlackRock earns an investment advisory fee for the service of managing these assets on behalf of its clients.  

In addition, the Company records on its consolidated statements of financial condition the separate account collateral received under BlackRock Life Limited securities lending arrangements for which it has legal title as its own asset in addition to an equal and offsetting separate account collateral liability for the obligation to return the collateral. The collateral is not available to creditors of the Company, and the borrowers under the securities lending arrangements have no recourse to the Company’s assets.  

Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products  

The Company consolidates certain sponsored investment products accounted for as variable interest entities (“VIEs”) and voting rights entities (“VREs”), (collectively, “CIPs”). See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on the Company’s consolidation policy.  

The Company cannot readily access cash and cash equivalents or other assets held by CIPs to use in its operating activities. In addition, the Company cannot readily sell investments held by CIPs in order to obtain cash for use in the Company’s operations.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following discussion summarizes the significant changes in assets and liabilities on a GAAP basis. Please see the consolidated statements of financial condition as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. The discussion does not include changes related to assets and liabilities that are equal and offsetting and have no impact on BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity.  

Assets. Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 and 2020 included $308 million and $206 million, respectively, of cash held by CIPs (see Liquidity and Capital Resources for details on the change in cash and cash equivalents during 2021). Accounts receivable at December 31, 2021 increased $254 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher base fees receivables. Investments, including the impact of CIPs increased $343 million from December 31, 2020 (for more information see Investments herein). Goodwill and intangible assets increased $990 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the Aperio Transaction, partially offset by amortization of intangible assets. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets at December 31, 2021 increased approximately $1 billion from December 31, 2020 (substantially offset by an increase in operating lease liabilities), primarily related to the previously described lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters located at 50 Hudson Yards in New York. Other assets increased $311 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in strategic minority investments and an increase in property and equipment. 

Liabilities. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2021 increased $452 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher 2021 incentive compensation accruals and higher deferred compensation. Operating lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020 (substantially offset by an increase in ROU assets), primarily related to the lease of office space for the Company’s future headquarters described above. Other liabilities increased $1.1 billion from December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher other liabilities of CIPs, including deferred carried interest liabilities and higher other liabilities. Net deferred income tax liabilities at December 31, 2021 decreased $915 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to the effects of temporary differences associated with capitalized costs, compensation and benefits and state and local income tax changes, partially offset by the Aperio Transaction, unrealized investment gains and revaluation of certain deferred income tax liabilities due to tax legislation enacted in the UK. 

Investments  

The Company’s investments were $7,262 million and $6,919 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Investments include CIPs accounted for as VIEs and VREs. Management reviews BlackRock’s investments on an “economic” basis, which eliminates the portion of investments that does not impact BlackRock’s book value or net income attributable to BlackRock. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.  

The Company presents investments, as adjusted, to enable investors to understand the portion of investments that is owned by the Company, net of NCI, as a gauge to measure the impact of changes in net nonoperating income (expense) on investments to net income (loss) attributable to BlackRock.  

The Company further presents net “economic” investment exposure, net of hedged investments, to reflect another helpful measure for investors. The impact of certain investments is substantially mitigated by swap hedges. Carried interest capital allocations are excluded as there is no impact to BlackRock’s stockholders’ equity until such amounts are realized as performance fees. Finally, the Company’s regulatory investment in Federal Reserve Bank stock, which is not subject to market or interest rate risk, is excluded from the Company’s net economic investment exposure.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Amounts included $1,504 million and $604 million of carried interest (VIEs) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which has no impact on the Company’s “economic” investment exposure. 

(2)  

Amounts exclude investments in strategic minority investments included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition 

The following table represents the carrying value of the Company’s economic investment exposure, by asset type, at December 31, 2021 and 2020:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amount includes the impact of foreign exchange movements. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

BlackRock Cash Flows Excluding the Impact of CIPs 

The consolidated statements of cash flows include the cash flows of the CIPs. The Company uses an adjusted cash flow statement, which excludes the impact of CIPs, as a supplemental non-GAAP measure to assess liquidity and capital requirements. The Company believes that its cash flows, excluding the impact of the CIPs, provide investors with useful information on the cash flows of BlackRock relating to its ability to fund additional operating, investing and financing activities. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, its cash flows presented in accordance with GAAP.  

The following table presents a reconciliation of the consolidated statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis to the consolidated statements of cash flows, excluding the impact of the cash flows of CIPs:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Sources of BlackRock’s operating cash primarily include base fees and securities lending revenue, performance fees, technology services revenue, advisory and other revenue and distribution fees. BlackRock uses its cash to pay all operating expenses, interest and principal on borrowings, income taxes, dividends on BlackRock’s capital stock, repurchases of the Company’s stock, acquisitions, capital expenditures and purchases of co-investments and seed investments.  

For details of the Company’s GAAP cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Cash flows provided by/(used in) operating activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, primarily include the receipt of base fees, securities lending revenue, performance fees and technology services revenue, offset by the payment of operating expenses incurred in the normal course of business, including year-end incentive and deferred compensation accrued for during prior years, and income tax payments.  

Cash flows used in investing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for 2021 were $1.8 billion and primarily reflected $1.1 billion of cash outflows related to the Aperio Transaction, $341 million of purchases of property and equipment and $481 million of net investment purchases, partially offset by $95 million of distributions of capital from equity method investees. 

Cash flows used in financing activities, excluding the impact of CIPs, for 2021 were $3.7 billion, primarily resulting from $2.5 billion of cash dividend payments, $1.5 billion of share repurchases, including $1.2 million in open market transactions and $285 million of employee tax withholdings related to employee stock transactions, and $750 million of repayments of long-term borrowings, partially offset by $991 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings. 

52 

The Company manages its financial condition and funding to maintain appropriate liquidity for the business. Management believes that the Company’s liquid assets, continuing cash flows from operations, borrowing capacity under the Company’s existing revolving credit facility and uncommitted commercial paper private placement program, provide sufficient resources to meet the Company’s short-term and long-term cash needs, including operating, debt and other obligations as they come due and anticipated future capital requirements. Liquidity resources at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

The percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company’s US subsidiaries was approximately 50% and 55% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. See Net Capital Requirements herein for more information on net capital requirements in certain regulated subsidiaries. 

(2)  

The Company cannot readily access such cash and cash equivalents to use in its operating activities.  

(3)  

Amounts do not reflect year-end incentive compensation accruals, which are paid in the first quarter.  

Total liquidity resources increased $957 million during 2021, primarily reflecting $991 million of proceeds from long-term borrowings, cash flows from operating activities, and a $400 million increase in the aggregate commitment amount under the credit facility, partially offset by cash dividend payments of $2.5 billion, share repurchases of $1.5 billion, cash outflow related to the Aperio Transaction of $1.1 billion and repayments of borrowings of $750 million. 

A significant portion of the Company’s $6 billion of investments, as adjusted, is illiquid in nature and, as such, cannot be readily convertible to cash.  

Share Repurchases. During 2021, the Company repurchased approximately 1.4 million of common shares under the Company’s existing share repurchase program for approximately $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2021, there were 3.6 million shares still authorized to be repurchased under the program.  

Net Capital Requirements. The Company is required to maintain net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries within a number of jurisdictions, which is partially maintained by retaining cash and cash equivalent investments in those subsidiaries or jurisdictions. As a result, such subsidiaries of the Company may be restricted in their ability to transfer cash between different jurisdictions and to their parents. Additionally, transfers of cash between international jurisdictions may have adverse tax consequences that could discourage such transfers.  

BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) is chartered as a national bank that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and whose powers are limited to trust and other fiduciary activities. BTC provides investment management and other fiduciary services, including investment advisory and securities lending agency services, to institutional clients. BTC is subject to regulatory capital and liquid asset requirements administered by the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company was required to maintain approximately $2.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, in net capital in certain regulated subsidiaries, including BTC, entities regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority in the United Kingdom, and the Company’s broker-dealers. The Company was in compliance with all applicable regulatory net capital requirements.  

Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries. As a result of The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on untaxed accumulated foreign earnings, US income taxes were provided on the Company’s undistributed foreign earnings. The financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries remains indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The Company will continue to evaluate its capital management plans. 

Short-Term Borrowings  

2021 Revolving Credit Facility. Since 2011, the Company has maintained an unsecured revolving credit facility which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, and has been amended several times (the “2021 credit facility”). In March 2021, the 2021 credit facility was amended to increase the aggregate commitment amount to $4.4 billion and to extend the maturity date to March 2026. In addition, the amendment incorporated certain sustainability-linked pricing metrics into the agreement. Specifically, the Company’s applicable interest rate and commitment fee are subject to upward or downward adjustments on an annual basis if the Company achieves, or fails to achieve, certain specified targets. In December 2021, the 2021 credit facility was further amended to change certain interest rates on borrowings based on the London Interbank Offered Rates to certain specified replacement rates. The 2021 credit facility permits the Company to request up to an additional $1.0 billion of borrowing capacity, subject to lender credit approval, which could increase the overall size of the 2021 credit facility to an aggregate principal amount of up to $5.4 billion. The 2021 credit facility requires the Company not to exceed a maximum leverage ratio (ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, where net debt equals total debt less unrestricted cash) of 3 to 1, which was satisfied with a ratio of less than 1 to 1 at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the Company had no amount outstanding under the 2021 credit facility. 

Commercial Paper Program. The Company can issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) on a private-placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $4 billion. The commercial paper program is currently supported by the 2021 credit facility. At December 31, 2021, BlackRock had no CP Notes outstanding. 

53 

Long-Term Borrowings  

The carrying value of long-term borrowings at December 31, 2021 included the following:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)   

The carrying value of the 1.25% Notes is calculated using the EUR/USD foreign exchange rate as of December 31, 2021. 

In December 2021, the Company issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.10% senior unsecured and unsubordinated notes maturing on February 25, 2032 (the “2032 Notes”). The net proceeds of the 2032 Notes are being used for general corporate purposes, which may include the future repayment of all or a portion of the $750 million 3.375% Notes due June 2022. Interest of approximately $21 million per year is payable semi-annually on February 25 and August 25 of each year, which commences on February 25, 2022. The 2032 Notes may be redeemed prior to November 25, 2031 in whole or in part at any time, at the option of the Company, at a “make-whole” redemption price or at 100% of the principal amount of the 2032 Notes thereafter. The unamortized discount and debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the 2032 Notes. 

In May 2021, the Company fully repaid $750 million of 4.25% notes at maturity. 

For more information on Company’s borrowings, see Note 15, Borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.  

Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies  

The Company’s material contractual obligations, commitments and contingencies at December 31, 2021 include borrowings, operating leases, investment commitments, compensation and benefits obligations, and purchase obligations.  

Borrowings. At December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $7.5 billion, of which $750 million is payable within 12 months. Future interest payments associated with these borrowings total $1.2 billion, of which $175 million is payable within 12 months. See Note 15, Borrowings, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing.  

Operating Leases. The Company leases its primary office locations under agreements that expire on varying dates through 2029. At December 31, 2021, the Company had operating lease payment obligations of approximately $2.3 billion, of which $165 million is payable within 12 months. See Note 13, Leases, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Investment Commitments. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $754 million of various capital commitments to fund sponsored investment products, including CIPs. These products include various illiquid alternative products, including private equity and real assets funds, and opportunistic funds. This amount excludes additional commitments made by consolidated funds of funds to underlying third-party funds as third-party noncontrolling interest holders have the legal obligation to fund the respective commitments of such funds of funds. Generally, the timing of the funding of these commitments is unknown and the commitments are callable on demand at any time prior to the expiration of the commitment. These unfunded commitments are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These commitments do not include potential future commitments approved by the Company that are not yet legally binding. The Company intends to make additional capital commitments from time to time to fund additional investment products for, and with, its clients.  

Compensation and Benefit Obligations. The Company has various compensation and benefit obligations, including bonuses, commissions and incentive payments payable, defined contribution plan matching contribution obligations, and deferred compensation arrangements. Accrued compensation and benefits at December 31, 2021 totaled $2.9 billion and included annual incentive compensation of $1.9 billion, deferred compensation of $584 million and other compensation and benefits related obligations of $414 million. Substantially all of the incentive compensation liability was paid in the first quarter of 2022, while the deferred compensation obligations are payable over various periods, with the majority payable over periods of up to three years. 

Purchase Obligations. In the ordinary course of business, BlackRock enters into contracts or purchase obligations with third parties whereby the third parties provide services to or on behalf of BlackRock. Purchase obligations represent executory contracts, which are either noncancelable or cancelable with a penalty. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s obligations primarily reflected standard service contracts for market data, office-related services, marketing and promotional services, and obligations for equipment. Purchase obligations are recorded on the consolidated financial statements when services are provided and, as such, obligations for services and equipment not received are not included in the consolidated statement of financial condition at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, the Company had purchase obligations of $608 million, of which $392 million is payable within 12 months.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. These estimates, judgments and assumptions are affected by the Company’s application of accounting policies. Management considers the following accounting policies and estimates critical to understanding the consolidated financial statements. These policies and estimates are considered critical because they had a material impact, or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and because they require management to make significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. For a summary of these and additional accounting policies see Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this filing. 

Consolidation  

The Company consolidates entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest. The company has a controlling financial interest when it owns a majority of the VRE or is a primary beneficiary (“PB”) of a VIE. Assessing whether an entity is a VIE or a VRE involves judgment and analysis on a structure-by-structure basis. Factors considered in this assessment include the entity’s legal organization, the entity’s capital structure and equity ownership, the rights of equity investment holders, the Company’s contractual involvement with and economic interest in the entity and any related party or de facto agent implications of the Company’s involvement with the entity. Entities that are determined to be VREs are consolidated if the Company can exert control over the financial and operating policies of the investee, which generally exists if there is greater than 50% voting interest. Entities that are determined to be VIEs are consolidated if the Company is the PB of the entity. BlackRock is deemed to be the PB of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that potentially could be significant to the VIE. There is judgment involved in assessing whether the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses of or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In addition, the Company’s ownership interest in VIEs is subject to variability and is impacted by actions of other investors such as on-going redemptions and contributions. The Company generally consolidates VIEs in which it holds an economic interest of 10% or greater and deconsolidates such VIEs once equity ownership falls below 10%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was deemed to be the PB of 75 VIEs. See Note 6, Consolidated Sponsored Investment Products, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.  

Fair Value Measurements  

The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement according to the fair value hierarchy (i.e., Level 1, 2 and 3 inputs, as defined) in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Fair Value Disclosures, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on fair value measurements.  

Changes in Valuation. Changes in value on $5,181 million of investments will impact the Company’s nonoperating income (expense), $526 million are held at cost or amortized cost and the remaining $1,555 million relates to carried interest, which will not impact nonoperating income (expense). At December 31, 2021, changes in fair value of $3,119 million of CIPs will impact BlackRock’s net income (loss) attributable to NCI on the consolidated statements of income. BlackRock’s net exposure to changes in fair value of CIPs was $1,887 million.  

Goodwill and Intangible Assets  

Goodwill represents the cost of a business acquisition in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized. The value of advisory contracts acquired in business acquisitions to manage AUM in proprietary open-end investment funds, collective trust funds and certain other commingled products without a specified termination date are classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets. The assignment of indefinite lives to such contracts primarily is based upon the following: (i) the assumption that there is no foreseeable limit on the contract period to manage these products; (ii) the Company expects to, and has the ability to, continue to operate these products indefinitely; (iii) the products have multiple investors and are not reliant on a single investor or small group of investors for their continued operation; (iv) current competitive factors and economic conditions do not indicate a finite life; and (v) there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. In addition, trade names/trademarks are considered indefinite-lived intangibles if they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely.  

Finite-lived investor/customer relationships, technology related assets, and management contracts, which relate to acquired separate accounts and funds, that are expected to contribute to the future cash flows of the Company for a specified period of time are amortized over their remaining expected useful lives, which, at December 31, 2021 ranged from 1 to 9 years with a weighted-average remaining estimated useful life of approximately seven years.  

Goodwill. The Company assesses its goodwill for impairment at least annually, considering such factors as the book value and the market capitalization of the Company. The impairment assessment performed as of July 31, 2021 indicated no impairment charge was required. The Company continues to monitor its book value per share compared with closing prices of its common stock for potential indicators of impairment. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s common stock closed at $915.56, which exceeded its book value of $248.50 per share.  

Indefinite-lived and finite-lived intangibles. The Company performs assessments to determine if any intangible assets are impaired at least annually, as of July 31st.  

In evaluating whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of indefinite-lived intangibles is less than carrying value, BlackRock performed certain quantitative assessments and assessed various significant qualitative factors including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. In addition, the Company considered other factors including: (i) macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which the Company operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics, a change in the market for an entity’s services, or regulatory, legal or political developments; and (iii) the Company-specific events, such as a change in management or key personnel, overall financial performance and litigation that could affect significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If an indefinite-lived intangible is determined to be more likely than not impaired, then the fair value of the asset is compared with its carrying value and any excess of the carrying value over the fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.

For finite-lived intangible assets, if potential impairment circumstances are considered to exist, the Company will perform a recoverability test, using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Factors included in evaluating finite-lived customer relationships, technology related assets and trade names include technology services revenue trends, customer attrition rates, obsolescence rates, and royalty rates. For finite-lived management contracts, evaluation is based on changes in assumptions including AUM, revenue basis points, projected AUM growth rates, operating margins, tax rates and discount rates. Actual results could differ from these cash flow estimates, which could materially impact the impairment conclusion. If the carrying value of the asset is determined not to be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flow test, the difference between the book value of the asset and its current estimated fair value would be recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs.  

In addition, management judgment is required to estimate the period over which finite-lived intangible assets will contribute to the Company’s cash flows and the pattern in which these assets will be consumed and whether the indefinite-life and finite-life classifications are still appropriate. A change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets, or the reclassification of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to a finite-lived intangible asset, could have a significant impact on the Company’s amortization expense, which was $147 million, $106 million and $97 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  

In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company performed impairment tests, including evaluating various qualitative factors and performing certain quantitative assessments. The Company determined that no impairment charges were required and that the classification of indefinite-lived versus finite-lived intangibles was still appropriate and no changes were required to the expected lives of the finite-lived intangibles. The Company continuously monitors various factors, including AUM, for potential indicators of impairment.  

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenues when its obligations related to the services are satisfied and it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue amount would not occur in future periods. The Company enters into contracts that can include multiple services, which are accounted for separately if they are determined to be distinct. Management judgment is required in assessing the probability of significant revenue reversal and in identification of distinct services. 

The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenue from investment advisory and administration fees which are recognized as the services are performed over time because the customer is receiving and consuming the benefits as they are provided by the Company. Fees are primarily based on agreed-upon percentages of AUM and recognized for services provided during the period, which are distinct from services provided in other periods. Such fees are affected by changes in AUM, including market appreciation or depreciation, foreign exchange translation and net inflows or outflows. AUM represents the broad range of financial assets the Company manages for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment management and trust agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue (for example, net asset values). 

The Company receives investment advisory performance fees, including incentive allocations (carried interest) from certain actively managed investment funds and certain separately managed accounts. These performance fees are dependent upon exceeding specified relative or absolute investment return thresholds, which vary by product or account, and include monthly, quarterly, annual or longer measurement periods. 

Performance fees, including carried interest, are recognized when it is determined that they are no longer probable of significant reversal (such as upon the sale of a fund’s investment or when the investment performance exceeds a contractual threshold at the end of a specified measurement period). Given the unique nature of each fee arrangement, contracts with customers are evaluated on an individual basis to determine the timing of revenue recognition. Significant judgement is involved in making such determination. Performance fees typically arise from investment management services that began in prior reporting periods. Consequently, a portion of the fees the Company recognizes may be partially related to the services performed in prior periods that meet the recognition criteria in the current period. At each reporting date, the Company considers various factors in estimating performance fees to be recognized, including carried interest. These factors include but are not limited to whether: (1) the amounts are dependent on the financial markets and, thus, are highly susceptible to factors outside the Company’s influence; (2) the ultimate payments have a large number and a broad range of possible amounts; and (3) the funds or separately managed accounts have the ability to a) invest or reinvest their sales proceeds or b) distribute their sales proceeds and the timing of such distributions.  

The Company is allocated/distributed carried interest from certain alternative investment products upon exceeding performance thresholds. The Company may be required to reverse/return all, or part, of such carried interest allocations/distributions depending upon future performance of these products. Carried interest subject to such clawback provisions is recorded in investments or cash and cash equivalents to the extent that it is distributed, on its consolidated statements of financial condition.  

The Company records a liability for deferred carried interest to the extent it receives cash or capital allocations related to carried interest prior to meeting the revenue recognition criteria. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $1,508 million and $584 million, respectively, of deferred carried interest recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. A portion of the deferred carried interest may also be paid to certain employees. The ultimate timing of the recognition of performance fee revenue and related compensation expense, if any, is unknown. See Note 17, Revenue, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for detailed changes in the deferred carried interest liability balance for 2021 and 2020. 

The Company earns revenue for providing technology services. Determining the amount of revenue to recognize requires judgment and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations and should be accounting for separately. Other judgments include determining whether performance obligations are satisfied over time or at a point in time. Fees earned for technology services are primarily recorded as services are performed over time and are generally determined using the value of positions on the Aladdin platform or on a fixed-rate basis. Revenue derived from the sale of software licenses is recognized upon the granting of access rights. 

56 

Adjustments to revenue arising from initial estimates recorded historically have been immaterial since the majority of BlackRock’s investment advisory and administration revenue is calculated based on AUM and recognized when known and since the Company does not record performance fee revenue until: (1) performance thresholds have been exceeded and (2) management determines the fees are no longer probable of significant reversal. See Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, in the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information on revenue recognition, including other revenue streams. 

Income Taxes 

The Company records income taxes based upon its estimated income tax liability or benefit. The Company’s actual tax liability or benefit may differ from the estimated income tax liability or benefit.  

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

Significant management judgment is required in estimating the ranges of possible outcomes and determining the probability of favorable or unfavorable tax outcomes and potential interest and penalties related to such unfavorable outcomes. Actual future tax consequences relating to uncertain tax positions may be materially different than the Company’s current estimates. At December 31, 2021, BlackRock had $1 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which $616 million, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.  

Management is required to estimate the timing of the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities, make assumptions about the future deductibility of deferred income tax assets and assess deferred income tax liabilities based on enacted tax rates for the appropriate tax jurisdictions to determine the amount of such deferred income tax assets and liabilities. At December 31, 2021, the Company had deferred income tax assets of $245 million and deferred income tax liabilities of $2,758 million on the consolidated statement of financial condition. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities may occur in certain circumstances, including statutory income tax rate changes, statutory tax law changes, changes in the anticipated timing of recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the structure or tax status of the Company.  

The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more likely than not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of recent losses, forecast of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods, the Company’s experience with tax attributes expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.
