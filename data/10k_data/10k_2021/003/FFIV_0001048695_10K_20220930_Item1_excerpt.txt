Strategy and Priorities

Nearly all organizations today find themselves at the convergence of two significant trends: the evolution of applications as the center of their businesses and their customers’ digital lives and the escalation of threats against those applications. This presents a tremendous challenge as many companies now manage complex application portfolios comprising older legacy and newer modern technologies and infrastructures. In our 2022 State of Application Strategy Report, 88 percent of organizations said they operate both legacy and modern application architectures, and 70 percent operate in multiple clouds. These hybrid

environments create operational complexity and expand the threat surface area as companies are forced to deploy separate, and often inconsistent, security controls across different environments.

Over the past several years, F5 has transformed its business and significantly expanded its software and cloud offerings to deliver a broad portfolio of solutions to help customers address the complexity and risk in today’s hybrid IT environments. Through BIG-IP, F5 NGINX, and F5 Distributed Cloud Services, F5 offers a range of integrated, machine learning-driven solutions that protect legacy and modern applications and APIs across data center, cloud, and edge locations. 

Our multi-cloud application security and delivery solutions reduce our customers’ operational complexity and costs, enabling our customers to scale, secure, and optimize both legacy and modern applications, across any infrastructure and create extraordinary digital experiences for their end users. We are leveraging near real-time collection of live application telemetry, machine learning and artificial intelligence, and toolchain automation to create adaptive applications capable of rapidly responding to changes in performance, availability, and security threats with little to no human interaction.

Key components of our strategy include:

Bringing our adaptive application vision to life 

F5 is uniquely positioned to deliver adaptive applications. Through our organic innovation and inorganic investments, we have created the broadest portfolio of multi-cloud application security and delivery technologies in the market. We are able to support our customers’ modern and legacy application security and delivery needs across any environment, with the flexibility of multiple deployment models including hardware, software, and SaaS offerings. F5 is continuing to converge our application security and delivery capabilities on our recently launched F5 Distributed Cloud Services platform, unifying policy declaration, enabling broader telemetry, and driving significant automation. Doing so will dramatically simplify application creation, deployment and management for our customers, reducing the time it takes to turn up and repair applications while lowering total cost of ownership, through a SaaS-based consumption model.

Transforming how customers experience F5

As we expand the role we play for our customers, we are also transforming how our customers experience F5. Our goal is to create a unified and frictionless F5 experience for our customers. Over the last several years, we have made it easier for our customers to procure, deploy, manage, and upgrade our technologies. We also have taken steps to integrate the customer experience across our growing portfolio by simplifying product naming and rebranding several acquired and integrated solutions as part of our F5 Distributed Cloud Services platform.

Going forward we will leverage and grow our foundational capabilities in data and insights, digital sales, and SaaS-delivered capabilities to deliver consistent world-class customer experiences, including simple, integrated and friction-free consumption of our technologies. We will continue to improve customer awareness and understanding of F5’s expanded portfolio with a focus on buying personas and business needs and intend to enhance our digital customer experiences to deliver both growth and efficiency.

Capturing growth in security and software

In the previous decade, our customers were focused on protecting their networks from attack. Today, attackers are targeting applications with threats like malware, bots, and API penetration. Through both organic and inorganic investment, we have expanded our application security portfolio and the deployment models through which customers can consume our solutions. F5’s leading security capabilities combined with our multi-cloud approach enables our customers to deploy a consistent security posture across their entire application estate.

In fiscal year 2022 we announced a major expansion of our security and delivery portfolio with the launch of F5 Distributed Cloud Services. This platform integrates F5 capabilities and recently acquired technologies to deliver security, multi-cloud networking and edge-based computing solutions on a unified SaaS platform. 

Our first solution for the platform, F5 Distributed Cloud WAAP (“Web Application Firewall and API Protection”), augments multiple security capabilities across F5 technologies enabling our customers to deploy advanced security, and unify and consistently manage policies while providing visibility into the enterprise security stature across all environments where the solution is deployed.

Beyond delivering security capabilities via multiple deployment models including hardware, software and SaaS, we continue to innovate across our software offerings including improving automation and orchestration in our BIG-IP software, and advancing the capabilities of our F5 NGINX solution.

Our solutions are also used by our customers to secure complex signaling for mobility protocols like Diameter, SIP, and GTP, as well as IoT protocols. 

Competition

As F5 expands its reach and role into a broader set of multi-cloud solutions, the companies that we consider competitors evolve as well. We compete against companies that offer server load balancing, traffic management, and other functions normally associated with application delivery, application security, and policy management. 

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include form factor, consumption model, ecosystem integrations, features and performance, customer support, brand recognition, scope of distribution and sales channels, and pricing. We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of the features and performance of our the products and services in our portfolio, and the broad functionality and value offered to our customers.

Within application delivery, we compete against Citrix Systems, VMware and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set, such as Amazon Web Services, Envoy, Google Cloud Platform, HAProxy, and Microsoft Azure.

We see emerging demand to support modern, container-based applications with new capabilities including managing APIs, optimizing Kubernetes traffic management, load balancing cloud-native and hybrid cloud applications and providing service mesh. For these use cases, we compete against emerging players like Apigee (Google Cloud) and Kong.

In application security, we compete with companies that provide web application firewalls, bot detection and mitigation, carrier-grade firewall, carrier-grade NAT, SSL orchestration, access policy management, DDoS protection, and fraud defense. Competitors include Akamai, Citrix Systems, Cloudflare, Imperva, Juniper Networks, Radware, and Symantec/Blue Coat. Our Silverline managed services and F5 Distributed Cloud Services offerings provide additional fraud, abuse, and analytics solutions. Indirect competitors in this space include Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, Imperva, and PerimeterX.

F5 Distributed Cloud Services use cases include multi-cloud networking, as well as security offered as SaaS, competing with the likes of Akamai, Cloudflare, Fastly, and Imperva.

Corporate Functions

Customer Services and Technical Support

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of professional services including consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other technical support services.

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise and service provider customers. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that includes installation, phone and online technical support, hardware repair and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting, and training services.

We provide these services directly to customers and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners. Our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base.

Product Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to innovate and to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners. Our engineering organization uses standard processes for the development, documentation, and quality control of services, software, and systems that are designed to meet these goals. These processes include working with our business development and marketing teams, customers, and partners to identify technology innovation opportunities to better meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets.

Over 90 percent of our engineers are engaged in software, SaaS, and managed services development in several major locations including Seattle, Washington; Hyderabad, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; San Jose and San Francisco, California; and Cork, Ireland.

Our hardware engineering team is located in Spokane, Washington; San Jose, California; and Tel Aviv, Israel.

Smaller development sites including Boulder, Colorado; Warsaw, Poland; and Billerica, Massachusetts also support the core development teams in the larger centers.

Members of all our engineering teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our solutions.

We believe that robust and constant innovation is a necessity for F5, so we are also innovating in new ways. We have had dedicated teams focused on testing new disruptive innovations in technology, business models, or customer segments. We expect innovations resulting from the work of these teams will be complementary to our goal of delivering the broadest and most consistent portfolio of solutions across cloud and on-premises environments.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. F5 holds 469 patents in the United States and has 66 international patents (with applications pending for various aspects of our technology). Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized 

7
parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our products. These are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination. While we may not be able to renew all of these licenses in the future, we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we had research and product development expenses of $543.4 million, $512.6 million, and $441.3 million, respectively.

Sales and Marketing

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global 1000 companies, including those in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing, healthcare, and government. In fiscal year 2022, sales outside of the Americas represented 41.7% of our net revenues. Refer to Note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area.

Sales

We sell our products and services to large and medium enterprise customers, including federal government entities, financial services customers and service providers through a variety of routes to market and channels. Our sales teams sell our products and services directly to customers by working closely with our channel partners including distributors, value-added resellers (“VARs”), managed service providers (“MSPs”), and systems integrators.

F5 sales teams. Our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads from marketing and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources. Our outside sales team works directly with partners and customers across the globe. Our field sales personnel are located in major cities in three sales regions: the Americas (primarily the United States); EMEA; and APAC. Field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to sell our products and services to their customers. We reward partners that identify new business and provide sales expertise for our portfolio of products and solutions through various incentive programs. Systems engineers, with deep technical domain expertise, support our regional sales account managers and channel partners providing pre-sale technical solution engineering and support, as needed.

Distributors, VARs, and MSPs. As a key component of our sales strategy, we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors, local and specialized distributors, VARs, and MSPs. We derive a majority of our product sales from VARs and MSPs, relying on our large distributors for fulfillment, training, and partner enablement.

Our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These agreements typically have one-year terms with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year 2022, sales to two of our worldwide distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Synnex Corporation represented 20.0% and 13.4% of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 90 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. The agreements grant certain distributors the right to distribute our products to resellers, with no minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators. We also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators, including Dell Services, DXC, HP Enterprise Services, and IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components of application deployments or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead, they typically recommend and/or manage our products as a part of broader solutions supporting enterprise applications and internet facing systems that incorporate our technology for security, high availability, and enhanced performance.

Resellers and technology partners. Historically, our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors. Currently, we partner with many technology 

8
partners and public cloud providers who resell our products. We have ongoing partnerships with the major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform and have expanded our reseller routes to market to include their public cloud marketplaces. F5 has recently signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (“SCA”) with AWS and are actively engaged with Microsoft Azure on private offers levering our software on Azure. Our business development team manages these relationships and closely monitors adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market.

Marketing

As we continue to expand our offerings and advance our range of consumption models (e.g., from on-premises to SaaS-based), we are focused on driving the compelling and unique value proposition of F5 among our existing customers as well as new buying centers. In addition to revitalizing our brand in the market, our expansion into new buying centers among existing customers (DevOps for example), exploration of new routes to market (such as public cloud marketplaces), and acquisition of a host of net new customers, compel us to increase our focus and investments in more digitally enabled, personalized and frictionless experiences at scale.

We are maintaining our efforts to drive momentum of our brand and reputation to deliver clarity, guidance and inspiration among our existing customers, future customers, partners, and employees around our evolving strategy behind F5’s unique offering. Additionally, to best support our growth as we transform our role in driving value for our customers, we are transforming marketing from a cost center to a revenue center to serve as a meaningful and predictable source of opportunities, customer growth and revenues. The critical success factors in this shift are increased investments in digital technologies, deep focus on the customer experience at every touchpoint, and shifting our culture to adopt an agile mindset as we use data to constantly improve our contributions to our customers and ultimately our shareholders.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware platforms to a third-party contract manufacturer, Flex Ltd. ("Flex"), for building, assembling, and testing according to our specifications at Flex's facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico and Zhuhai, China. Flex also performs the following activities on our behalf: material procurement, PCB assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control, and direct shipment. 

We provide a rolling forecast that allows Flex to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity, and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end-user demand. Flex procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products, and tests them according to our specifications. Generally, we do not own the system components. Hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components. Many of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However, we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly and are increasing in light of global shortages of critical components. Global supply chain constraints continue to decrease our visibility into component availability and lead times even for commodity components. Per the terms and conditions with our agreement with Flex , if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Systems built in Guadalajara are shipped to the Flex fulfillment center in Milpitas, California for distribution primarily to distributors, value-added resellers, or end users in EMEA and the Americas. Systems built and fulfilled in Zhuhai are for distribution to partners and customers in APAC. Title to the products transfers from Flex to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location.

Backlog

Backlog is primarily systems-based and represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be fulfilled and invoiced to customers with approved credit status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers, or product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to fulfillment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues. At the end of fiscal year 2022, we had product backlog of approximately $231 million.

Human Capital Management

F5’s commitment to its employees is to be one global and diverse team that is both human-first and high-performance and to attract and grow amazing talent. This commitment is delivered through our culture and engagement, our investment in 

9
employees’ growth and development, our focus on diversity and inclusion, and in our compensation, benefits, and wellbeing offerings.

Employees

As of September 30, 2022, we had 7,089 employees – over 99% of whom were full time employees. Our employees are in 46 countries with 50% of employees in the United States. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are in good standing, as evidenced by our bi-annual employee engagement survey results and described in the section below entitled Culture and Engagement.

Culture and Engagement

We have been able to sustain our strong company culture in a hybrid work model thanks to increased focus on continuously embedding BeF5 behaviors and LeadF5 principles into our systems, processes, decisions, and conversations. We are constantly reinforcing, rewarding, and recognizing desired behaviors to send the message that they are key to executing on our strategy. 

We measure the success of and identify areas of improvement for our company culture through global surveys of employee experience and sentiment at least twice each year. As of June 2022, employees reported high satisfaction with F5’s culture on several key questions:

•95% of employees favorably rate “F5 has demonstrated that employee well-being and health is a priority during the coronavirus outbreak."

•91% of employees favorably rate “I am proud to work for F5."

•91% of employees favorably rate “At F5, employees are treated equally and fairly regardless of their background.”

•90% of employees favorably rate “F5 has a great culture."

•84% of employees favorably rate “I feel a sense of belonging at F5.” 

Additionally, F5 is a recognized Great Place to Work 2022 in both India and the United States and was awarded the Bestie 2022 award by Benevity.

Growth and Development

We provide employees with opportunities to improve their technical and professional knowledge, better understand our business and products, strengthen management and leadership, as well as maintain our high standards of business integrity through ongoing compliance training. These development opportunities include live events on quarterly “Learning Days” dedicated to learning and exploring new ideas; learning paths created to support specific areas of knowledge, including deepening their knowledge of BeF5 and LeadF5; leadership coaching, which matches participants with an expert external coach; a global mentoring program; and a sponsorship program which provides several hundred employees a year with customized professional and personal development. Employees also have access to multiple third-party resources to enhance the learning opportunities developed internally. In a competitive market for talent, investing in growth and development at F5 remains a key differentiator for our employee recruitment and retention.

Diversity and Inclusion

F5 believes our differences—when embraced with humility and respect—drive smarter decisions, increased innovation, stronger performance, and a culture where everyone can be themselves and reach their full potential. 

10
At F5, we are committed to creating a more diverse and inclusive workplace. Our strategic framework is called “IDEA”: Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Allyship. Each concept in IDEA requires focus and engagement at all levels of the organization and to be embedded into our ways of working. (For more information, please see the “Open House Report” at F5.com/company/diversity-inclusion).

To increase inclusion at F5, we foster communities through our Employee Inclusion Groups (“EIGs”) – F5 Ability, F5 Appreciates Blackness, F5 Connects Women, F5 Latinx e Hispanos Unidos, F5 Military Veterans, F5 Multicultural and F5 Pride – bringing people together across F5 and around the world. All seven EIGs are led by employees, with a dedicated annual budget and executive sponsor. F5’s EIG leaders partner with the Company’s Diversity & Inclusion team to cultivate personal and professional growth amongst their members. Our EIG leaders’ efforts to build a thriving community of diverse individuals at F5 are recognized through quarterly bonuses.

Our diversity as a company is advanced by the steady increase in our transparency on the actions and the accompanying progress we have made to build a culture of belonging and representation. F5 will release the results of the Company’s first diversity representation and employee inclusion score metrics to the short-term cash incentive program for the Company’s executives in the Proxy Statement for fiscal year 2022.

To increase equity in opportunities across F5, we hosted our biennial development conference focused on leadership development and targeting our Black and Latinx communities within F5. This year’s conference tripled the number of attendees and had a satisfaction rating of 4.6 out of 5. Replays of several of the conference’s speakers are available for public viewing on F5’s YouTube channel. 

Allyship is critical to the sustainability of our diversity and inclusion program at F5. We hosted an allyship track at our conference and launched micro-trainings across our workforce and around the world. Each month, content is made available to the allyship community to deepen their understanding of experiences different from their own and gain new skills to help speak up and be an active participant in creating a more diverse and inclusive F5.

Compensation, Benefits and Wellbeing

F5 offers a competitive Total Rewards package intended to attract, retain, and motivate our employees guided by our human-first approach. Our package includes market-competitive pay, incentive plans, restricted stock unit grants (“RSUs”), an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement plans, healthcare, paid time off and family leave. We continue to evaluate and enhance our programs to support the diverse needs of our employees’ overall health and wellbeing. We continue our Freedom to Flex program allowing employee choice to work fully remote, hybrid, or full time in an F5 office. The flexibility in hiring remote workers is another element that supports our ability to attract diverse talent. This and related programs resulted in our COVID-19 global pandemic response being among the highest rated categories on our global employee survey.

One key program we have maintained and expanded to support our employees’ wellbeing are four wellness weekends when once a quarter all employees have a set Friday through Monday off. This program allows F5 employees to collectively take time off to relax, recharge, and focus on wellness without worry of coming back to an over-loaded inbox. In addition, in fiscal year 2022, we expanded in the United States our healthcare travel reimbursement to assist our employees’ access to certain covered medical procedures that may be unavailable in their state of residence, increased our fertility and adoption assistance benefits, and added Juneteenth as a company holiday in the United States.

The mental wellbeing of our employees remains a very important area of focus. F5 has made and continues to make significant investments in tools and programs to address employee mental health. Such investments include a paid subscription to a meditation app for all global employees, mental health awareness training provided to managers (also attended by our Executive Leadership Team), and the removal of out-of-network penalties for therapy visits on our United States medical plans - which also opened up greater access to diverse therapists.

Environmental, Social & Governance

At F5, we care deeply not just about what we do, but how we do it. We consider this our “human-first” approach to the way we conduct our business, and it is reflected in our expanded commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) – extending from the environmental sustainability of our products and operations to the well-being of our employees and our communities. 

Environmental. Since F5 formed the ESG team in fiscal year 2021, the focus has been on bringing the environmental program at the Company up to the standards we are proud to have set over the last 28 years in social and governance. In fiscal year 2022, F5 took its first step towards a climate target; committing to reduce our absolute scope 1 and 2 emissions 50% by 

11
2030 from a 2021 baseline year. We will complete our Scope 3 emissions inventory across our value chain, to issue our complete science-based target with the Science Based Target Initiative by the close of fiscal year 2023.

To start taking immediate action on our target, F5 made its first-ever purchase of renewable energy certificates in fiscal year 2022. We focused on buying renewable energy in the Western region of the United States first, given that our highest volume of emissions worldwide is currently concentrated around our headquarters in Seattle, WA and offices in Spokane, WA and San Jose, CA. 

Social. In addition to the employee programs and benefits outlined in the Human Capital Management section above, we continue to prioritize F5 Global Good, the community development initiative that amplifies our employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs. In fiscal year 2022, more than half of all worldwide employees participated in Global Good programs, volunteering over 7,200 hours and directing the entirety of F5’s donations, through both the Company matching program and grant selection committees. F5 and its employees donated over $4.6 million to over 3,000 non-profits worldwide in fiscal year 2022. 

Governance. Our guiding principle to do the right thing for each other, our customers, our shareholders, and our communities is set forth in F5’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, compliance training programs and most importantly, in the behaviors and principles we measure all employees on: BeF5 and LeadF5.

In fiscal year 2022, F5 bolstered the governance of the working and environmental conditions in our supply chain by joining the Responsible Business Alliance.

The oversight of our ESG programs is conducted by the Nominating and ESG Committee of the Board of Directors, where ESG strategy, disclosures and metrics are reviewed each quarter. In addition, in fiscal year 2022, the Talent and Compensation Committee of the Board introduced additional ESG metrics to the short-term cash incentive program for the Company’s executives in the form of measurements related to year-over-year increases in diversity representation and measurement of employee inclusion.
