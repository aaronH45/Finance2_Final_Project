Executive Overview

2021 Financial Highlights

Net income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,004,299,000, an increase of $176,669,000, or 21.3%, over the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains, as well as increased NOI in the current year from Development and newly acquired communities. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in NOI from Same Store and communities sold in 2020 and 2021, and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year.

Same Store NOI attributable to our apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary residential revenue ("Residential"), for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,370,282,000, a decrease of $66,283,000, or 4.6%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to a decrease in rental revenue of $45,643,000, or 2.2%, as well as an increase in property operating expenses of $20,300,000, or 3.2%, over 2020.

During 2021, we raised approximately $2,138,184,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes; sale of common shares under our fifth continuous equity program ("CEP V"); and the sale of nine consolidated operating communities, condominiums at The Park Loggia and other real estate. This amount does not include our share of proceeds from joint venture dispositions. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.

We believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2021, we:

•Completed the construction of nine consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 2,752 apartment homes and 29,000 square feet of commercial space, for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,070,000,000. 

•Started the construction of 10 consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 3,010 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $1,246,000,000.

We also achieved portfolio growth through acquisitions, acquiring seven consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 1,932 apartment homes and 90,000 square feet of commercial space for an aggregate purchase price of $724,500,000.

We believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing), provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

COVID-19 Pandemic

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted our business operations to address the safety of and financial impacts on our residents and associates, including, in certain jurisdictions (i) providing flexible lease renewal options, (ii) creating payment plans for residents who are impacted by COVID-19 and (iii) waiving late fees and certain other customary fees associated with apartment rentals. To the extent still implemented, we may discontinue these measures at any time except where required by law.

The impact on our consolidated results of operations from COVID-19 for future periods will depend, among other factors, on (i) the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government to address COVID-19 and any variants and relieve the economic distress of consumers, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent, and (ii) the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic. 

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our collections and associated outstanding receivables, with the impact partially mitigated by payments received under government rent relief programs. The following table presents, for our 2021 Same Store communities for the periods presented, the percentages of the following charges to residents that we have collected, including (i) apartment base rent and (ii) other rentable items, such as parking and storage rent, along with pet and other recurring fees in accordance with residential leases (collectively, "Collected Residential Revenue," which excludes transactional fees). Included in collections are $28,286,000 of aggregate rent relief payments received for our Same Store portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_________________________

(1)Collections are for our 2021 Same Store communities and exclude commercial revenue, which was 1.0% of our 2021 Same Store total revenue.

(2)The Collected Residential Revenue percentage as of the last day in the respective quarter.

(3)The percentage of Collected Residential Revenue as of January 31, 2022.

(4)Collected Residential Revenue for January 2022 as of January 31, 2022 was 93.0%.

The collection rates are based on resident activity as reflected in our property management systems and are presented to provide information about collections trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the collections information provided was not routinely produced for internal use by senior management or publicly disclosed by the Company and is a result of analysis that is not subject to internal controls over financial reporting. This information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, does not reflect GAAP revenue or cash flow metrics and may be subject to adjustment in preparing GAAP revenue and cash flow metrics. Additionally, this information should not be interpreted as predicting the Company’s financial performance, results of operations or liquidity for any period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding rent receivable balance for residential and commercial tenants, net of reserves, was $18,594,000 and $18,159,000, respectively.

Communities Overview

As of December 31, 2021 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 297 apartment communities containing 87,992 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 17 consolidated communities were under development and one community was under redevelopment. We have an indirect interest in 12 of the 297 apartment communities which were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including two that are being developed within joint ventures. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 24 communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 8,070 apartment homes.

Our real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development communities, Unconsolidated Development communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further classified as Same Store 

34 
communities, Other Stabilized communities, Lease-Up communities, Redevelopment communities and Unconsolidated communities.

Same Store communities are consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy at the beginning of the current year or were acquired during the year. Lease-Up communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and does not have stabilized occupancy. Redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the fiscal year. Unconsolidated communities are communities in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated entity. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, “Segment Reporting,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Although each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Same Store communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in “Results of Operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

NOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.

35 
Results of Operations

Our year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in Same Store NOI; NOI derived from acquisitions, development completions and development under construction and in lease-up; loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. In addition, as discussed above under “Executive Overview - COVID-19 Pandemic” and elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, and may continue to do so. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Discussion of our operating results for 2020 and comparison to 2019 can be found in Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021. A comparison of our operating results for 2021 and 2020 follows (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Percent change is not meaningful.

Net income attributable to common stockholders increased $176,669,000, or 21.3%, to $1,004,299,000 in 2021 over 2020, primarily due to an increase in gains on consolidated and unconsolidated real estate dispositions in the current year, partially offset by a decrease in Same Store NOI and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year.

36 
NOI is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, depreciation expense, income tax expense (benefit), casualty and impairment loss, gain on sale of communities, gain on other real estate transactions, net, net for-sale condominium activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale.

NOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Residential NOI represents results attributable to the Company's apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary residential revenue. Reconciliations of NOI and Residential NOI for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Represents results attributable to the non-apartment components of our mixed-use communities and other non-residential operations ("Commercial").

37 
The Residential NOI changes for 2021 as compared to 2020 consists of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in our Residential Same Store NOI in 2021 is due to a decrease in rental revenue of $45,643,000, or 2.2% and an increase in property operating expenses of $20,300,000, or 3.2%, over 2020.

Rental and other income decreased $5,676,000, or 0.2%, in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased rental rates, amortization of concessions at our Same Store communities and decreased rental income from dispositions, partially offset by additional rental income generated from development completions and development under construction and in lease-up and acquisitions, increased occupancy at our Same Store communities and a decrease in commercial uncollectible lease revenue.

As discussed elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic, and direct and indirect related economic, regulatory and operating impacts, are likely to continue to adversely affect our rental revenue. Deteriorating financial conditions among our residents and commercial tenants, as well as regulations that limit our ability to evict residents and tenants, may continue to result in higher than normal uncollectible lease revenue. The pandemic may also continue to depress demand among consumers for our apartments for a variety of other reasons, including (i) if consumers decide to live in markets that are less costly than ours for one or more reasons, such as a decline in their income, remote working arrangements, or if they cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues; (ii) that consumers who would otherwise rent may seek home ownership; and (iii) ongoing downward pressures on demand for certain types of housing (e.g., corporate apartment homes) or by certain consumers (e.g. students or consumers who require seasonal job-related demand such as in the entertainment industry).

Consolidated Communities—The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 75,744 apartment homes for 2021, as compared to 73,724 homes for 2020. The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $2,518 for 2021 as compared to $2,593 in 2020.

Same Store rental revenue decreased $35,671,000, or 1.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year. 

•Residential rental revenue decreased $45,643,000, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, including an offsetting decrease in uncollectible lease revenue of $2,227,000. See below for a table detailing the change in Same Store Residential rental revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2021, including the attribution of the change between rental rates and Economic Occupancy (as defined below).

•As a result of the pandemic, we increased our use of residential concessions during 2021 and 2020 relative to concessions granted prior to 2020. Concessions for our Same Store communities granted in 2021 decreased from the prior year by $6,209,000 to $42,237,000. Concessions granted in 2021 remain at elevated levels relative to years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Concessions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective leases (generally one year) and contributed to the overall decline in our Same Store rental revenue in 2021. The amortization of residential concessions for our Same Store communities increased by $38,190,000 in 2021 as compared to the prior year, and the remaining net unamortized balance of residential concessions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14,209,000 and $30,272,000, respectively.

•Commercial rental revenue increased $9,972,000, or 87.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year due to a reduction in uncollectible lease revenue of $11,826,000, for the year ended December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table presents the change in Same Store Residential rental revenue, including the attribution of the change between rental rates and Economic Occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_________________________________

(1) Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents.

Direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes increased $20,465,000, or 4.6%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, as well as the timing of repairs and maintenance projects previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Same Store Residential direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, represents 99.9% of total Same Store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021. Residential direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $14,759,000, or 3.7%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of repairs and maintenance projects previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Property taxes increased $9,900,000, or 3.6%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities and increased assessments for the Company's stabilized portfolio, partially offset by decreased property taxes from dispositions.

Same Store Residential property taxes represents 98.8% of total Same Store property taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021. For Same Store, property taxes increased $5,541,000, or 2.3%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased assessments across the portfolio, increased rates in California and Metro NY/NJ and the expiration of certain property tax incentive programs in New York City in the current year, partially offset by successful appeals in 2021 in New York, California and Florida.

39 
Expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries primarily reflect costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits and any recoveries of costs incurred. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and therefore may vary significantly from year to year. In addition, the timing for potential recoveries will not always align with the timing for expensing an abandoned pursuit. Expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, decreased $9,168,000, or 73.9%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The amount for 2020 includes the write-off of $7,264,000 related to a Development Right in New York City. 

Interest expense, net increased $6,264,000, or 2.9%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, interest income and any mark to market impact from derivatives not in qualifying hedge relationships. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest and an increase in the amount of unsecured indebtedness, partially offset by lower overall effective rates on unsecured indebtedness and a combination of a decrease in variable rates on, and amounts of, secured indebtedness.

Loss on extinguishment of debt, net reflects (i) prepayment penalties and (ii) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, premiums/discounts and deferred hedging losses from our debt repurchase and retirement activity. The losses on extinguishment of debt, net of $17,787,000 and $9,333,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were primarily due to the repayments of unsecured notes during each of those years.

Depreciation expense increased $51,265,000, or 7.2%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, partially offset by dispositions.

General and administrative expense (“G&A”) increased $9,268,000, or 15.4%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to legal settlement proceeds that were present in the prior year, coupled with increases in the current year of compensation related expenses, including executive transition costs, during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Casualty and impairment loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3,119,000 consists of a $1,971,000 charge recognized for the damages across several communities in our East Coast markets related to severe storms and a $1,148,000 charge recognized for property and casualty damages resulting from a fire at an operating community.

Income from investments in unconsolidated entities increased $32,163,000 in 2021 as compared to the prior year, due to unrealized gains on property technology investments recognized in the current year and the gain on the sale of the final two communities in Archstone Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the "AC JV"), partially offset by the gain on the sale of a community in Archstone Multifamily Partners AC LP (the "U.S. Fund") in the prior year.

Gain on sale of communities increased in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gains of $602,235,000 and $340,444,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were primarily due to the sale of nine wholly-owned operating communities in both 2021 and 2020.

Gain on other real estate transactions, net represents the impact from the sale of land parcels and other tangible and intangible real estate assets, and increased $1,657,000, or 376.6%, in 2021 due to the sale of residential entitlements.

Net for-sale condominium activity is a net expense of $977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a net gain of $2,551,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and is comprised of the net gain before taxes on the sale of condominiums at The Park Loggia less the associated marketing, operating and administrative costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 53 residential condominiums at The Park Loggia, for gross proceeds of $135,458,000, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $3,110,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 70 residential condominiums at The Park Loggia for gross proceeds of $216,372,000, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $8,213,000. In addition, we incurred $4,087,000 and $5,662,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in marketing, operating and administrative costs.

Income tax (expense) benefit of $5,733,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to activity generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") and was comprised primarily of tax expense for condominium sales at The Park Loggia and other ancillary real estate. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to tax losses as well as provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the "CARES Act").

40 
Reconciliation of FFO and Core FFO

Consistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts® (“Nareit”), we calculate Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders ("FFO") as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for:

•gains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities;

•cumulative effect of change in accounting principle;

•impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets;

•write-downs of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates;

•depreciation of real estate assets; and

•similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including those from a change in control.

FFO and FFO adjusted for non-core items, or “Core FFO,” as defined below, are generally considered by management to be appropriate supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help with the comparison of the operating and financial performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. By further adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of our core business operations, Core FFO can help with the comparison of the core operating performance of the Company year over year. We believe that, in order to understand our operating results, FFO and Core FFO should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report.

We calculate Core FFO as FFO, adjusted for:

•joint venture gains (if not adjusted through FFO), non-core costs and promoted interests from partnerships;

•casualty and impairment losses or gains, net on non-depreciable real estate;

•gains or losses from early extinguishment of consolidated borrowings;

•development pursuit write-offs and expensed transaction costs, net of recoveries;

•third-party business interruption insurance proceeds and the related lost NOI that is covered by the expected third party business interruption insurance proceeds;

•property and casualty insurance proceeds and legal settlement activity;

•gains or losses on sales of assets not subject to depreciation and other investment gains or losses;

•advocacy contributions, representing payments to promote our business interests;

•hedge ineffectiveness or gains or losses from derivatives not designated as hedges for accounting purposes;

•severance related costs; 

•executive transition compensation costs;

•net for-sale condominium activity, including gains, marketing, operating and administrative costs and imputed carry cost;

•income taxes; and 

•other non-core items.

FFO and Core FFO do not represent net income in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income, which remains the primary measure, as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO and Core FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and Core FFO.

FFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A presentation of GAAP-based cash flow metrics is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.

The following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders and to Core FFO attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands, except per share data).

(5) Amount for 2021 relates to activity generated in our TRS and is comprised primarily of tax expense for condominium sales at The Park Loggia and other ancillary real estate. Amount for 2020 relates to tax losses as well as provisions of the CARES Act. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal focus on near-term and intermediate-term liquidity is to ensure we have adequate capital to fund:

•development and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged or in which we plan to engage;

•the minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code;

•debt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity;

•normal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses; and

•investment in our operating platform, including strategic investments.

42 
Factors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Cash flows from operations are determined by: operating activities and factors including but not limited to (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels, (iv) uncollectible lease revenue levels or interruptions in collections caused by market conditions and (v) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage is affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. Our plans for development, redevelopment, non-routine capital expenditure, acquisition and disposition activity are affected by market conditions and capital availability. We frequently review our liquidity needs, especially in periods with volatile market conditions, as well as the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.

We had cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow of $543,788,000 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $230,256,000 from $313,532,000 at December 31, 2020. The following discussion relates to changes in cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.

Operating Activities—Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $1,203,170,000 in 2021 from $1,219,615,000 in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in NOI.

Investing Activities—Net cash used in investing activities totaled $624,053,000 in 2021. The net cash used was primarily due to:

•acquisition of seven operating communities for $771,692,000;

•investment of $654,861,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; and

•capital expenditures of $153,235,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets.

These amounts were partially offset by:

•net proceeds from the disposition of nine operating communities and ancillary real estate of $850,230,000; and

•net proceeds from the sale of for-sale residential condominiums of $124,532,000.

Financing Activities—Net cash used in financing activities totaled $348,861,000 in 2021. The net cash used was primarily due to:

•payment of cash dividends in the amount of $888,344,000; 

•repayment of unsecured notes in the amount of $462,147,000; and

•mortgage notes repayments and principal amortization payments in the amount of $109,562,000.

These amounts were partially offset by:

•proceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of $1,098,643,000; and

•the issuance of common stock in the amount of $31,874,000 primarily through CEP V.

Variable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility

We have a $1,750,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in February 2024. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility (e.g., one month to maturity, three months to maturity, etc.) and (ii) the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes. The current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is LIBOR plus 0.775% per annum (0.88% at January 31, 2022), assuming a one month borrowing rate. The annual facility fee for the Credit Facility remained at 0.125%, resulting in a fee of $2,188,000 annually based on the $1,750,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating.

43 
We had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $6,969,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2022. In addition, we had $39,581,000 outstanding in additional letters of credit unrelated to the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2022.

The phase-out of LIBOR and expected transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects on our LIBOR borrowings. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.

Financial Covenants

We are subject to financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility, Term Loans and the indentures under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:

•limitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;

•limitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and

•minimum levels of debt service coverage.

We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021.

In addition, some of our secured borrowings include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.

Continuous Equity Offering Program 

In May 2019, we commenced CEP V under which we may sell (and/or enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of) up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determinations of the appropriate funding sources. We engaged sales agents for CEP V who receive compensation of up to 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. We expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, and to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, a commission of up to 1.5% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. During 2021 and through January 31, 2022, we sold 122,343 shares of common stock at an average sales price of $226.15 per share, for net proceeds of $27,253,000 under this program. In addition, at December 31, 2021, we were party to a forward contract under CEP V to sell 68,577 shares of common stock for approximate proceeds of $16,000,000 net of offering fees and discounts based on the initial forward price, with settlement of the forward contract to occur on one or more dates not later than December 31, 2022. The final proceeds will be determined on the date(s) of settlement after adjustments for our dividends and a daily interest factor. As of January 31, 2022, we had $705,961,000 remaining authorized for issuance under this program, after consideration of the forward contract.

44 
Forward Interest Rate Swap Agreements

The following derivative activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021:

•We terminated $150,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020, receiving a payment of $6,962,000. We recognized $2,894,000 of these proceeds as a gain in 2020 and $2,654,000 of these proceeds as a gain during the year ended December 31, 2021, included in interest expense, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

•In conjunction with the issuance of our $700,000,000 2.05% unsecured notes due 2032 in September 2021, we settled $200,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2021, designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes, making a net payment of $2,211,000. We have deferred these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognizing the impact as a component of interest expense, net, over the term of the respective hedged debt.

•We entered into an additional $150,000,000 of new forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2022.

At the maturity of the remaining outstanding swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment.

Stock Repurchase Program

In July 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $500,000,000 (the "2020 Stock Repurchase Program"). Purchases of common stock under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be exercised at our discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During 2021 and through January 31, 2022, we had no repurchases of shares under this program. As of January 31, 2022, we had $316,148,000 remaining authorized for purchase under this program.

Future Financing and Capital Needs—Debt Maturities and Material Obligations

One of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that capital from additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory, especially in light of the uncertain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets.

The following debt activity occurred during 2021:

•In January 2021, we repaid $27,795,000 principal amount of 5.37% fixed rate secured debt at par in advance of the April 2021 maturity date. 

•In September 2021, we repaid $450,000,000 principal amount of our 2.95% unsecured notes in advance of the September 2022 scheduled maturity, recognizing a loss on debt extinguishment of $17,890,000, composed of a prepayment penalty of $12,147,000, and the non-cash write off of unamortized deferred hedging losses and unamortized deferred financing costs of $5,743,000. 

•In September 2021, we issued $700,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately $694,617,000, before 

45 
considering the impact of other offering costs. The notes mature in January 2032 and were issued at a 2.05% interest rate. The notes were issued under our green bond framework, and we have allocated or will allocate the net proceeds, in whole or in part, to one or more new or existing eligible green projects.

•In November 2021, we repaid an aggregate of $73,060,000 principal amount of fixed rate secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.79% at par in advance of the November 2036 maturity date.

•In November 2021, we issued $400,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately $396,976,000, before considering the impact of other offering costs. The notes mature in December 2028 and were issued at a 1.90% interest rate. The notes were issued under our green bond framework, and we have allocated or will allocate the net proceeds, in whole or in part, to one or more new or existing eligible green projects.

The following table details our consolidated debt obligations, including the effective interest rate and contractual maturity dates, and principal payments for periodic amortization and maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest.

(1)Rates are given as of December 31, 2021 and include credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees’ fees, the impact of interest rate hedges, offering costs, mark to market amortization and other fees.

(2)Balances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and exclude deferred financing costs and debt discount for the unsecured notes of $50,606 and $47,995 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, deferred financing costs and debt discount associated with secured notes of $16,278 and $17,482 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report.

(3)During 2021, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date.

(4)Financed by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement.

In addition to consolidated debt, we have scheduled contractual obligations associated with (i) ground leases for land underlying current operating or development communities and commercial and parking facilities and (ii) office leases for our corporate headquarters and regional offices of $14,879,000 for 2022, $14,642,000 for 2023 and $372,346,000 thereafter. 

Future Financing and Capital Needs—Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity

In 2022, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from one or more of a variety of internal and external sources, which may include (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2022 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.

Before beginning new construction or reconstruction activity in 2022, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we plan to source sufficient capital to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.

47 
From time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities and new markets where our partners bring development and operational expertise and/or experience to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.

In addition, we may invest, through mezzanine loans or other preferred equity investments, in multifamily development projects being undertaken by third parties. In these cases, we do not expect to acquire the underlying real estate but rather to earn a return on our investment (through interest or fixed rate preferred equity returns) and a return of the invested capital generally following completion of construction either on or before a set due date. As of January 31, 2022, we have not made any such investments but are pursuing opportunities.

In evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue-generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.

Investments

We invest in consolidated real estate entities, unconsolidated investments in real estate ventures and direct and indirect investments in technology and environmentally focused companies through investment management funds. 

Consolidated Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired the following communities, which includes acquisitions marking our entry in the Texas and North Carolina expansion markets, containing 90,000 square feet of commercial space (dollars in thousands). See Note 5, "Investments," for further discussion. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold nine wholly-owned operating communities containing 2,404 apartment homes and 30,000 square feet of commercial space (dollars in thousands). See Note 6, "Real Estate Disposition Activities," for further discussion.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Unconsolidated Investments

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we had the following investment activity related to our unconsolidated real estate and technology and environmentally focused investments. See Note 5, "Investments," for further discussion. 

•Archstone Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the "AC JV") sold its final two communities, Avalon North Point and Avalon North Point Lofts, located in Cambridge, MA, for $325,000,000. Our proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP was $23,305,000. In conjunction with the disposition of Avalon North Point, the AC JV repaid a $111,653,000 loan made by equity investors in the venture at par.

•Arts District Joint Venture was formed to develop, own, and operate AVA Arts District, an apartment community located in Los Angeles, CA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 475 apartment homes and 56,000 square feet of commercial space when completed. We have a 25.0% ownership interest in the venture. As of December 31, 2021, excluding costs incurred in excess of equity in the underlying net assets of the venture, we have an equity investment of $30,436,000 in the venture. In addition to the equity contributions, the venture borrowed $11,581,000 under its $167,147,000 of the construction loan during the year ended December 31, 2021.

•Avalon Alderwood MF Member, LLC (“Avalon Alderwood Mall”) was formed to develop, own, and operate Avalon Alderwood Mall, an apartment community located in Lynnwood, WA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 328 apartment homes when completed. We have a 50.0% ownership interest in the venture. As of December 31, 2021, we have an equity investment of $55,054,000 in the venture, which represents substantially all of our required equity contributions.

•We invested $17,277,000 in various property technology and environmentally focused companies directly and indirectly through investment management funds. We have $39,890,000 of outstanding equity commitments to these investment management funds, with the timing and amount for these commitments to be fulfilled dependent on if, and when, investment opportunities are identified by the respective funds. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income and unrealized gains of $15,908,000 related to these investments, included as a component of Income from investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. 

Supplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations

The following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment" in the prospectus dated February 25, 2021 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021.

The second paragraph under the heading “-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Distributions Attributable to Sale or Exchange of Real Property” is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:

Subject to the following paragraph, we will be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 21% (or the then applicable highest corporate rate of U.S. federal income tax) of any distributions to non-U.S. stockholders attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests. Under long-standing regulations, we also may be required to withhold on any distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that we designate as capital gain dividends, including any distributions that could have been designated as capital gain dividends. Amounts so withheld are creditable against the 

49 
non-U.S. stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A non-U.S. stockholder who receives distributions attributable to gain from a sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property interests will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “assume,” “project,” “plan,” “may,” “shall,” “will,” "pursue" and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:

•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition;

•our potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities;

•the timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment;

•the timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;

•the timing and net sales proceeds of condominium sales;

•the pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;

•the anticipated operating performance of our communities;

•cost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates;

•the impact of landlord-tenant laws and rent regulations;

•our expansion into new markets;

•the real estate markets in Metro New York/New Jersey, Northern and Southern California, Denver, Colorado, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general;

•the availability of debt and equity financing;

•interest rates;

•general economic conditions, including the potential impacts from current economic conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic; 

•trends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and

•the impact of outstanding legal proceedings.

We cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.

Risks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other factors, (i) the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government, including measures to relieve economic distress, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and (ii) the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic. In addition, the effects of the pandemic are likely to heighten the following risks, which we routinely face in our business.

Some of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:

•we may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;

50 
•we may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses;

•construction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;

•we may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;

•the timing and net proceeds of condominium sales may not equal our current expectations;

•occupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;

•financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline, which could limit our pursuit of opportunities;

•the impact of new landlord-tenant laws and rent regulations may be greater than we expect;

•our cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness;

•we may be unsuccessful in our management of joint ventures and the REIT vehicles that are used with certain joint ventures; 

•laws and regulations implementing rent control or rent stabilization, or otherwise limiting our ability to increase rents, charge fees or evict tenants, may impact our revenue or increase our costs;

•our expectations, estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding outstanding legal proceedings are subject to change; and

•the possibility that we may choose to pay dividends in our stock instead of cash, which may result in stockholders having to pay taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received, if any.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, “Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

Cost Capitalization

We capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue. 

51 
During the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $46,263,000 and $45,268,000 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.

There may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses. 

We capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.

Due to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. As of December 31, 2021, capitalized pursuit costs associated with Development Rights totaled $40,414,000.

Abandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment

We evaluate our direct and indirect investments in real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.

The assessment of impairment can involve subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset. Estimates of the undiscounted cash flows are sensitive to significant assumptions including future rental revenues, operating expenses, and our intent and ability to hold the related asset, which could be impacted by our expectations about the future.

We expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years. 

Our focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.
