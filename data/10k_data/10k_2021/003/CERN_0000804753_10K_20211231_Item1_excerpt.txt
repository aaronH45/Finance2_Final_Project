Our corporate world headquarters is located in a Company-owned office park in North Kansas City, Missouri, with our principal place of business located at 2800 Rock Creek Parkway, North Kansas City, Missouri 64117. Our Web site, which we use to communicate important business information, can be accessed at: www.cerner.com. We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports available free of charge on or through this Web site as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). We do not intend for information contained in our website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K.

Cerner is a leading supplier of healthcare information technology ("HCIT") solutions and services. We offer a wide range of intelligent solutions and tech-enabled services that support the clinical, financial and operational needs of organizations of all sizes. Cerner® solutions and services help clinicians make care decisions and assist organizations in managing the health of their populations. We also offer integrated clinical and financial systems to help manage day-to-day revenue functions, as well as a wide range of services to support clinical, financial and operational needs. We have also expanded our presence in the life sciences industry, where we work with healthcare stakeholders to improve the safety, efficiency, and efficacy of clinical research.

Cerner solutions are primarily offered on the unified Cerner Millennium® architecture and on the HealtheIntent® cloud-based platform. Cerner Millennium is a person-centric computing framework, which includes integrated clinical, financial and management information systems. This architecture allows providers to securely access an individual's electronic health record ("EHR") at the point of care, and it organizes and proactively delivers information to meet the specific needs of physicians, nurses, laboratory technicians, pharmacists, front- and back-office professionals and consumers. On our HealtheIntent platform, we offer solutions that aggregate, transform and reconcile data across the continuum of care, enabling key stakeholders to manage the health of populations, improve outcomes, enhance clinical research and lower costs. Cerner also has an EHR agnostic platform, CareAware®, that facilitates connectivity of healthcare devices to EHRs and helps improve hospital operations, allowing for more efficient and effective care.

On February 2, 2015, Cerner acquired the Health Services business from Siemens AG, which offered a portfolio of enterprise-level clinical and financial healthcare information technology solutions, as well as departmental and care coordination solutions globally. Refer to Notes (8) and (9) of the notes to consolidated financial statements ("Notes") for information on our acquisitions and dispositions.

We offer a broad range of tech-enabled services, including implementation and training, remote hosting, application management services, revenue cycle services, support and maintenance, healthcare data analysis, real-world evidence, clinical process optimization, transaction processing, employer health centers, and data-driven services that help life sciences companies with the discovery, development and deployment of therapies.

In addition to software and services, we offer a wide range of complementary hardware and devices, primarily as a reseller for third parties.

The following table presents consolidated revenues by our business models and by segment, as a percentage of total revenues:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A description of our business models is as follows:

•Licensed software - We develop and license intellectual property ("IP") (our architectures, application software, executable and referential knowledge, data and algorithms) to our clients. Our licensed software business model includes revenues from IP delivered via perpetual license and software as a service, where functionality is delivered via "the cloud".

•Technology resale - We bundle licensed software with other companies' IP in the form of sublicenses to create complete technology solutions for our clients. We also resell bundled computer equipment (hardware) from technology companies to create a completely functional system. Additionally, we resell medical devices for medical device companies.

•Subscriptions - Another method by which we provide IP is on a time-based subscription model that has a periodic usage charge. This is the primary way we package and provide medical knowledge, which changes frequently based on research and can be updated independently from the software in which it is embedded. Also included in this category of revenue is our Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI") transaction revenue. EDI is the electronic transfer of data between healthcare providers and payers.

•Professional services - We provide a wide range of professional services to assist our clients in the implementation of our information systems in their organizations. These services are in the form of project management, technical and application expertise, clinical process optimization, regulatory consulting and education and training of our clients' workforce to assist in the design and implementation of our systems. This business model also includes certain outsourcing services utilized by healthcare organizations as well as services provided to the life sciences industry through our Cerner EnvizaSM offerings.

•Managed services - Our managed services business model includes revenues from remote hosting, operational management services, and disaster recovery. Remote hosting is the largest of these offerings, and it involves Cerner buying the necessary equipment, installing it in one of our data centers, and operating the entire system on the client's behalf.

•Support and maintenance - This business model is comprised of the ongoing support and maintenance services we provide our clients. Almost all of our clients contract for these services. Clients with support contracts get 24x7 access to our immediate response center, which serves as our "emergency room," as well as access to our SolutionWorks organization for less urgent issues. In addition, our clients' support payments give them ongoing

access to the latest releases of our IP. We also provide support for sublicensed software and maintenance for third party hardware.

•Reimbursed travel - Includes reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses (primarily travel) incurred in connection with our client service activities.

Healthcare and Healthcare IT Industry

There are several major forces shaping healthcare worldwide.

•Rising Healthcare Costs - Healthcare costs continue to grow faster than the economy, with total healthcare expenditures increasing 4.5% to $3.8 trillion in 2019 and 9.7% to $4.1 trillion in 2020, representing 19.7% of the U.S. Gross Domestic Product ("GDP"). Health expenditures are expected to grow over 5% annually through 2028, which would bring them to approximately 20% of GDP. Similar growth trends exist in most major non-U.S. markets as well.

We believe the trajectory of healthcare expenditure growth is unsustainable, and we believe information technology can play an important role in addressing the key drivers of this growth by driving efficiencies, reducing waste, and improving management of chronic conditions and helping prevent them in the first place. In summary, IT can play a key role in facilitating a shift from a high-cost healthcare system that incents volume to a proactive system that incents health, quality and efficiency.

•Evolving Reimbursement - With the full enactment of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA"), Medicaid expansion, and the aging population driving Medicare growth, the government is playing an increasingly material role in U.S. healthcare economics. The implications for providers include increased regulatory requirements for payment at less favorable terms than commercial payers. This reality has exacerbated an already tough margin profile and is expected to be the new normal for the years to come. Provider organizations are also dealing with an ongoing shift to value-based reimbursement models that reward clinicians for value over volume. These changes, over time, could materially change provider economics, but also represent an opportunity for the industry to move to where providers are more incented to keep people healthy than based on the volume of visits and procedures.

•Aging Population - As Baby Boomers continue to reach retirement age, they are putting stress on our healthcare system. The first Boomer turned 65 in 2011, and the last will turn 65 in 2029. Their healthcare needs—and Medicare costs—are increasing at the same time their contributions to Medicare decline, placing additional pressure on the healthcare industry to rein in costs while also improving quality and ability to manage chronic conditions. 

•Consumer Expectations - Increased out-of-pocket expense and technology utilization outside healthcare have contributed to rising consumer expectations on cost, convenience and service. This growing consumerism has increased the political focus on rising drug prices, surprise medical bills, and escalating premiums, highlighting the importance of having comprehensive strategies for engaging consumers.

•Cognitive Computing - Today, healthcare is principally digitized across the core clinical, operational and financial settings. However, while workflows have been digitized, business processes remain largely unautomated and the industry has yet to realize the benefits of digitization achieved in other industries. Cognitive computing represents a meaningful opportunity to leverage the digitization that now exists in healthcare to improve efficiency and quality, and we believe Cerner is well positioned to play a key role in helping the healthcare industry achieve this potential.

•Coronavirus ("COVID-19") Pandemic - The healthcare and life sciences industries are at the forefront of the pandemic with heroic efforts by healthcare providers on the frontlines and advances in technology and science enabling vaccines to get to market in an unprecedented timeframe. Longer term, we believe the pandemic could lead to an acceleration of macro trends already playing out. Examples of this include the likelihood the pandemic accelerates the role of the Federal government as the top regulator and payor for healthcare; ongoing health system consolidation; and increased consumer expectations, particularly around the convenience of telehealth.

For the core provider market, many of these forces are contributing to an overall challenging macro environment. Providers are simultaneously seeking to grow key service lines, drive operational efficiencies to make money at Medicare rates, and build out the competencies required to take and effectively manage risk and participate in value-based reimbursement models. Information technology is seen as an enabler of these efforts, which represents an opportunity for Cerner. At the same time, the low-margin nature of provider businesses can make it difficult to fund required investment, making it important for solutions and services to have a clear return on investment.

Cerner Vision and Growth Strategy

Throughout our history, Cerner has focused on creating innovation at the intersection of healthcare and information technology. Our vision has long been to create a Health Network Architecture ("HNA") for providers of care in every community. HNA has four core pillars: automate the care process; connect the person; structure, store and study the data; and then 'close the loop' by pushing analytic insights back into the care process. The base digitization that now exists in healthcare is foundational to achieving this vision, and we continue to believe it can be achieved in the decade to come.

Our framework for growth as we work towards achieving our long-term vision includes three core areas. 

First, we are focused on delivering in our core market, including executing effectively on our large U.S. federal contracts, continuing to enhance key solution areas, such as revenue cycle, that are important to existing clients and represent revenue growth opportunities, and aligning with our provider clients to help them increase revenue in key service lines, tackle margin compression and optimize their reimbursement dollars. In addition, we are investing in our core products and platforms with a focus on delivering software as a service that we expect to improve clinician experience and patient outcomes, lower total cost of ownership, enable clients to accelerate adoption of new functionality, and better leverage third-party innovations. These efforts can differentiate Cerner and position our installed client base to better manage the forces of change playing out in healthcare.

Second, we are continuing work towards advancing the HNA vision that has driven Cerner almost since its inception. We believe that through the creation of a cohesive architecture for healthcare, the walls between care centers will become transparent as information travels seamlessly among care settings. Data collected at one setting will be available to others across the country, ensuring every individual in every part of the care process is connected to the right knowledge, resources and persons at the appropriate time and place. We believe the coming decade is the window when the confluence of technology, data liquidity and business model shifts can make this vision a reality. Health systems are increasingly building network strategies within specific regions to enhance contracting power, increase patient stickiness and move closer to the premium dollar. Cerner has an opportunity to become a strategic partner and assist with network design, provide services in areas such as cybersecurity and operational reporting, and improve performance under value-based contracting. 

Third, Cerner has an opportunity to harness data to drive growth in new areas, including using real-world evidence to improve clinical research. Cerner has natural points of differentiation, including our trusted relationships with healthcare providers and access to data given our technology is in place in approximately a quarter of U.S. healthcare facilities, and our proven ability to aggregate and normalize multiple sources of data through our HealtheIntent platform, which contains data from more than 300 million longitudinal records.

To focus on this opportunity, we launched Cerner Enviza in 2021. Cerner Enviza combines the expertise of Cerner and Kantar Health, which we acquired in April 2021. Kantar Health's leading data, analytics, real-world evidence and commercial research consultancy, combined with Cerner's real-world data, positions Cerner Enviza to help accelerate discovery, development and deployment of therapies and advance clinical research and the life sciences industry to improve everyday health. 

Importantly, Cerner's health data strategy is based on curating data from a willing and engaged network of providers with an emphasis on clear boundaries around the usage of patient data and based on clearly defined use cases with clarity and transparency around data rights.

In summary, we believe Cerner's core value proposition remains strong and there is ample opportunity to grow both organically and inorganically through the areas discussed above.

Oracle Merger Agreement

On December 20, 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as it may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Merger Agreement") with Cedar Acquisition Corporation ("Merger Subsidiary"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of OC Acquisition LLC ("Parent"), Parent, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), and (solely with respect to performance of its obligations set forth in certain specified sections thereof) Oracle. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, on January 19, 2022, Oracle commenced a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock for a purchase price of $95.00 per share, net to the holders thereof in cash, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding. Following the completion of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary will merge with and into Cerner (the "Merger"), with Cerner continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Oracle, at which time the shares of our common stock would cease to be publicly held. Completion of the Merger is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to, a) shareholders holding a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock tendering their shares in the Offer, and b) receipt of certain regulatory approvals, including the expiration or termination of the waiting periods or the obtaining of the required affirmative approvals applicable to the transaction under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and certain foreign antitrust and foreign direct investment laws. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements in the Merger Agreement, including with respect to the operation of our business prior to the closing of the transaction, such as restrictions on making certain acquisitions and divestitures, entering into certain contracts, incurring certain indebtedness and making certain capital expenditures, paying dividends in excess of our regular quarterly dividend, issuing or repurchasing stock and taking other specified actions. We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs, or capital expenditure requirements. Additional information about the Offer and Merger and the Merger Agreement is set forth in our filings with the SEC.

Contracting with the Government

As we grow our federal business, revenue attributable to prime contracts or to subcontracts with other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government is becoming a bigger contributor to our overall revenue. Within the U.S. government, our revenues are diversified across various agencies, including the Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. During 2021 and 2020, approximately 20% and 18%, respectively, of our total revenues were attributable to our relationships (as the prime contractor or a subcontractor) with U.S. government agencies. Contracting with the U.S. government subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks, including the U.S. government's ability to cancel any contract at any time through a termination for the convenience of the U.S. government. Government cancellation terms typically permit the recovery of all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed prior to termination when the U.S. government issues a termination for convenience. These regulations and risks are described in more detail below under "Risk Factors" in this annual report on Form 10-K.

Software Development

We commit significant resources to developing new health information system solutions and services. As of the end of 2021, approximately 6,150 associates were engaged in research and development activities. Total expenditures for the development and enhancement of our software solutions were $829 million, $797 million and $784 million during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These figures include both capitalized and non-capitalized portions and exclude amounts amortized for financial reporting purposes.

As discussed above, continued investment in research and development ("R&D") remains a core element of our strategy. This will include ongoing enhancement of our core solutions and development of new solutions and services.

Intellectual Property

We have a broad portfolio of intellectual property rights to protect the proprietary interests in our solutions, services, devices and brands. Our solutions constitute works of authorship protected by copyrights in the United States and globally. We own valuable trade secrets embodied in, or related to, our solutions, services and devices and protect these rights through a number of technical and legal measures. We have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in a number of countries with particular emphasis on the Cerner branding elements. We continue to develop our patent portfolio and own more than 650 issued patents with hundreds of patent applications pending. We do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same.

Our solutions, devices and services incorporate or rely on intellectual property rights licensed from third parties, including software subject to open source software licenses. Certain technologies licensed to Cerner are also important for internal use in running our business and supporting our clients. Although replacing any existing licenses could be inconvenient, based on our experiences, existing contractual relationships, and the incentives of our technology suppliers, we believe that Cerner will continue to obtain these technologies or suitable alternatives for commercially reasonable prices on commercially reasonable terms or under open source software licenses acceptable to Cerner.

Managing Cybersecurity Risks

Our business operations, including the provision of the solutions and services described above, involve the compilation, hosting and transmission of confidential information, including patient health information. We have included security features in our solutions and services that are intended to protect the privacy and integrity of this information, but our solutions and services may be vulnerable to security breaches, viruses, programming errors and other similar disruptive problems. Cerner maintains documented information privacy, security and risk management programs with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, policies, and procedures which are designed to secure the information maintained on Cerner's platforms.

In addition, all of our associates are required to complete annual cybersecurity education and training, which includes identifying suspicious emails, Internet threats, telecommunication threats and ransomware. Cerner regularly reviews and modifies its security program to reflect changing technology, regulatory environment, laws, risk, industry and security practices and other business needs. We believe our policies and procedures are adequate to ensure that relevant information about cybersecurity risks and incidents is appropriately reported and disclosed.

Sales and Marketing

The markets for Cerner HCIT solutions, healthcare devices and services include integrated delivery networks, physician groups and networks, managed care organizations, hospitals, medical centers, free-standing reference laboratories, home health agencies, blood banks, imaging centers, pharmacies, pharmaceutical manufacturers, employers, governments and public health organizations. The majority of our sales are clinical and revenue cycle solutions and services to hospitals and health systems, but our solutions and services are highly scalable and sold to organizations ranging from physician practices, to community hospitals, to complex integrated delivery networks, to local, regional and national government agencies. Sales to large health systems typically take approximately nine to 18 months, while the sales cycle is often shorter when selling to smaller hospitals and physician practices.

Our executive marketing management is located at our world headquarters in North Kansas City, Missouri, while our client representatives are deployed across the United States and globally. In addition to the United States, through our subsidiaries, we have sales associates and/or offices giving us a presence primarily in Europe, the Middle East, Australia, Canada, and India.

We support our sales force with technical personnel who perform demonstrations of Cerner solutions and services and assist clients in determining the proper hardware and software configurations. Our primary direct marketing strategy is to generate sales contacts from our existing client base and, in years when COVID-19 was not a concern, through presentations at industry seminars and tradeshows. We market our ambulatory solutions, offered on a subscription basis, directly to the physician practice market using lead generation activities and through existing acute care clients that are looking to extend Cerner solutions to affiliated physicians. Normally, we attend a number of major tradeshows each year and sponsor executive user conferences, which feature industry experts who address the HCIT needs of large healthcare organizations.

Backlog

Backlog, which reflects contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized as revenue, was $13.26 billion as of December 31, 2021, of which we expect to recognize approximately 31% as revenue over the next 12 months.

We believe that backlog may not necessarily be a comprehensive indicator of future revenue as certain of our arrangements may be canceled (or conversely renewed) at our clients' option; thus contract consideration related to such cancellable periods has been excluded from our calculation of backlog. However, historically our experience has been that such cancellation provisions are rarely exercised. We expect to recognize $1.22 billion of revenue over the next 12

months under currently executed contracts related to such cancellable periods, which is not included in our calculation of backlog.

Competition

The market for HCIT solutions, devices and services is intensely competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to rapid technological change. The principle markets in which we compete include, without limitation, healthcare software solutions, HCIT services, ambulatory, healthcare device and technology resale, healthcare revenue cycle and transaction services, value-based care technologies, analytics systems, care management solutions, population health management, and post-acute care. Our principal existing competitors, including their affiliates, in these markets include, but are not limited to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition, we expect that major software information systems companies, large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators, start-up companies, managed care companies, healthcare insurance companies, accountable care organizations and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions, devices or services. The pace of change in the HCIT market is rapid and there are frequent new software solutions, devices or services introductions, enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets include the breadth and quality of solution and service offerings, the stability of the solution provider, the features and capabilities of the information systems and devices, the ongoing support for the systems and devices and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions and devices. We believe that we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors and that we are the leader- or among the leaders- in each of our main offerings. Our brand recognition and reputation for innovative technology and service delivery, combined with our breadth of solution and services offerings, global distribution channels and client relationships position us as a strong competitor going forward.

Human Capital Management

Cerner believes that attracting, engaging and retaining employees is vital to the Company's continued success. Our Chief Human Resources Officer, reporting directly to our Chief Executive Officer, oversees our human capital management strategies. In addition, our Board of Directors is actively involved in our human capital management in its oversight of our long-term strategy and through its committees and engagement with management. 

At Cerner, we're collectively working to create a culture and a community where our employees, who we refer to as our associates, feel their voice is heard in our ongoing efforts to make a difference in the future of healthcare. Our efforts have earned Cerner recognition over the years as one of Forbes' Best Employers, Best Employers for Diversity, Best Employers for LGBTQ Equality and a perfect score on the Human Right Campaign Equality Index.

The Company employed approximately 25,150 associates worldwide as of December 31, 2021. Of that total population, approximately 70% of our associates were employed in the United States and the remaining associates were employed outside the United States. Approximately 39% of our associates work in professional services (implementation, training, consulting and other services), 24% of our associates work in development (coding and engineering), 10% of our associates work in managed services (hosting), and the remaining associates work in other areas with no such area making up 10% or more of our associate base.

Our human capital management operating model focuses on the following strategic areas:

Talent Acquisition: We continue to actively hire talent and are primarily focused on recruiting talent in support of our strategic growth initiatives. We strive for the attraction, retention and development of skilled, engaged teams of diverse associates.

Associate Experience and Engagement: We strive to create an environment in which associates are fully engaged, feel safe, have a sense of belonging and are empowered to make a difference. We focus on an inclusive culture to retain talent. These ongoing efforts are shaped by the action planning from our annual employee engagement census survey. 

Talent Management: Cerner has an ongoing approach to performance and career management that is grounded in behaviors embedded in every day experiences that encourage the continual development of associates. Associates work with their managers to align goals and ask for feedback to enable achievement of outcomes that we believe matter most to Cerner clients.

Organization Design and Effectiveness: This area focuses on organizational design consulting, the integration of new associates from our business acquisitions, and coaching. 

Associate Relations and Employment Practices: This area focuses on compliance with applicable employment laws, associate relations and resolving associate employment-related disputes, as well as on managing the process for departing associates, including the provision of outplacement services. In addition, this area provides proactive performance coaching for our associates. Associates are encouraged to report ethics, safety, or grievances through multiple channels including a company provided confidential hotline.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I"): This area focuses on education, embedding DE&I into our talent processes and programs, associate community building, market outreach, fostering a culture of inclusion and developing enterprise diversity strategies. We have an enterprise-wide DE&I strategy to achieve holistic transformation in collaboration with executives, leaders and associates.
