ITEM 1 - BUSINESS

BACKGROUND

Overview and Mission

Intuit helps consumers and small businesses prosper by delivering financial management, compliance, and marketing products and services. We also provide specialized tax products to accounting professionals, who are key partners that help us serve small business customers.

Our mission is to power prosperity around the world. Across our platform, we use the power of technology to deliver three core benefits to our customers: helping put more money in their pockets, saving them time by eliminating work so they can focus on what matters to them, and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make.

All of our customers have a common set of needs. Our global technology platform, which includes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp, is designed to help consumers and small businesses manage their finances, get and retain customers, save money, pay off debt and do their taxes with ease and confidence so they receive the maximum refund they deserve. For those customers who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs and go into business for themselves, we are focused on helping them find and keep customers, get paid faster, pay their employees, manage and get access to capital, and ensure their books are done right. We serve more than 100 million customers and generated revenue of $12.7 billion in our fiscal year which ended July 31, 2022.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping our world — and Intuit is taking advantage of this technological revolution to find new ways to improve the customer experience and deliver on our mission. We are focused on capitalizing on this opportunity to improve prosperity globally and inspire our workforce, while investing in our company’s reputation and durable growth in the future. 

Intuit Inc. was incorporated in California in March 1984. We reincorporated in Delaware and completed our initial public offering in March 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at 2700 Coast Avenue, Mountain View, California, 94043, and our main telephone number is 650-944-6000. When we refer to “we,” “our” or “Intuit” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (Intuit Inc.) and its California predecessor, as well as all of our consolidated subsidiaries.

Our Business Portfolio

We organize our businesses into four reportable segments:

Our Business and Growth Strategy

At Intuit, our strategy starts with customer obsession. We listen to and observe our customers, understand their challenges, and then use advanced technology, including AI, to develop innovative solutions to help consumers and small businesses prosper. Our strategy for delivering on our bold goals is to be an AI-driven expert platform where we and others can solve our customers’ most important problems. We plan to accelerate the development of the platform by applying AI in three key areas:

 Intuit Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K4

Tables of Contents

•An Open Platform: None of us can do it alone, including Intuit. The best way to deliver for customers is by creating an open, collaborative platform. It’s the power of partnerships that accelerates the world’s success. Our open technology platform integrates with partners so, together, we can deliver value and benefits that matter the most to our customers.

•Application of AI: AI helps our customers work smarter because we can automate, predict and personalize their experience. Using AI technologies, we are: leveraging machine learning to build decision engines and algorithms that learn from rich datasets to transform user experiences; applying knowledge engineering and turning compliance rules into code; and using natural language processing to revolutionize how customers interact with products and services. 

•Incorporating Experts: One of the biggest problems our customers face is lack of confidence. Even with current advances in technology that deliver personalized tools and insights, many customers want to connect with a real person to help give them the confidence they are making the right decision. By bringing experts onto our platform we can solve this massive problem for customers. The power of our virtual expert platform allows us to scale the intelligence of our products, elevating experts to advisors and delivering big benefits for customers. 

As we build our AI-driven expert platform, we prioritize our resources on five strategic priorities across the company. These priorities focus on solving the problems that matter most to customers and include:

•Revolutionizing speed to benefit: When customers use our products and services, we use the power of data-driven customer insights to deliver value instantly and aim to make interactions with our offerings frictionless, without the need for customers to manually enter data. We are accelerating the application of AI and investing in decentralized technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency, with a goal to revolutionize the customer experience and help customers put more money in their pockets faster. This priority is foundational across our business, and execution against it positions us to succeed with our other four strategic priorities.

•Connecting people to experts: The largest problem our customers face is lack of confidence to file their own taxes or to manage their books. To build their confidence, we connect our customers to experts. We offer customers access to experts to help them make important decisions – and experts, such as accountants, gain access to new customers so they can grow their businesses. We are also expanding how we think about virtual experiences by exploring metaverse technologies and broadening the segments we serve beyond tax and accounting, to play a more meaningful role in our customers’ lives. 

•Unlocking smart money decisions: Crippling high-cost debt and lack of savings are at unprecedented levels across the US. To address these challenges, we are creating an autonomous financial platform with Credit Karma that helps consumers find the right financial products, puts more money in their pockets and connects them to insights and education. 

•Be the center of small business growth: We are focused on helping customers grow their businesses by offering a broad, seamless set of tools that are designed to help them get and retain customers, get paid faster, manage and get access to capital, pay employees with confidence, and use third-party apps to help run their businesses. At the same time, we want to position ourselves to better serve product-based businesses to benefit customers who sell products through multiple channels.

•Disrupt the small business mid-market: We aim to disrupt the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. This offering enables us to increase retention of these larger customers, and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by available offerings.

As the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers’ needs. For nearly 40 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions that are designed to solve our customers' most important financial problems, are easy to use, and are available where and when customers need them. As a result, our customers actively recommend our products and solutions to others, which is one important way that we measure the success of our strategy.

For financial information about our reportable segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Small Business & Self-Employed

Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our goal is for QuickBooks to be the source of truth for each small business customer who uses our integrated platform. We work to make this a reality through our three-pillared growth strategy: Grow the Core by transforming financial management software and meeting customers where they are; Connect the Ecosystem, by meeting a wider range of customer needs with a single integrated platform; and Expand Globally, by serving small businesses around the world. With this strategy, we enable a powerful ecosystem, personalized using artificial intelligence, that scales across our customers’ most pressing needs.

Small business owners are constantly faced with challenges and barriers in their journey to success. Universally, small businesses at every stage of growth struggle to get customers, get paid, get capital, pay workers, get access to advice, and stay compliant and organized. Our innovative, end-to-end customer growth platform provides actionable, AI-driven insights our customers need to grow and run their businesses with confidence.

We also offer Mint, which is an online personal finance offering aimed at helping customers track their finances and daily financial behaviors and was a part of this segment through July 31, 2022.

We also offered TurboTax Live for customers seeking to obtain tax advice from professionals, TurboTax Live Full Service for customers seeking to have their tax returns prepared for them, as well as audit defense and audit support services.

 Intuit Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K7

Tables of Contents

our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. Our TurboTax U.S. and Canada offerings consist of desktop and online offerings.

Credit Karma

Our Credit Karma segment provides consumers with a financial platform that helps them find the right financial products and put more money in their pockets. The platform offers a number of free services to its members: access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, data-driven resources, personalized recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and online savings and checking accounts through our bank partner, MVB Bank, Inc., Member FDIC. To provide these services to its members, Credit Karma works with a variety of partners, including credit bureaus, banks, credit card issuers, insurance carriers, and other financial institutions and lending partners. Additionally, Credit Karma leverages Lightbox, a first-of-its-kind enterprise platform which allows lenders to leverage thousands of de-identified data points from Credit Karma members to help provide its members with greater certainty that they will be approved if they apply for a financial product. 

ProConnect

Our ProConnect segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada. These offerings enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of consumer, small business, and commercial federal and state tax returns. Lacerte is designed for full-service year-round accounting firms who handle more complex returns. ProSeries is designed for year-round tax practices handling moderately complex tax returns. ProConnect Tax Online is our cloud-based solution, which is designed for full-service year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and small business returns and integrates with our QuickBooks Online offerings.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.

We develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.

Our online offerings have rapid development cycles, while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.

We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including global offerings, and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings.

SEASONALITY

Our Consumer and ProConnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal 

 Intuit Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K8

Tables of Contents

pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. 

In fiscal 2022, the IRS began accepting returns on January 24, 2022, and the tax filing deadline was April 18, 2022. However, in fiscal 2021, the IRS began accepting returns on February 12, 2021, and the tax filing deadline was May 17, 2021. In fiscal 2020, the IRS began accepting returns on January 27, 2020, and the tax filing deadline was July 15, 2020. As a result of the extensions of the tax filing deadlines in 2021 and 2020, a significant amount of our fiscal 2021 and 2020 Consumer segment and ProConnect segment revenues were recognized in the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2022.

We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProConnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

Markets 

Our primary customers are consumers and small businesses. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants, who are key partners to help us reach small business customers. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the widespread usage of mobile devices and social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.

Real-time, personalized online shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods, and other changes in the way we do business.

Marketing Programs

We use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of the Intuit brand and our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include offline marketing such as TV, radio, billboard, magazine and newspaper advertising; digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; mobile marketing through online app stores; email marketing; retail marketing; public relations; sponsorships, and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross sell additional offerings.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Multi-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers primarily research products and services online. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online. Others research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.

Direct Sales Channel. We offer many of our products and services directly through our websites, apps, and call centers. Direct, online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, via other online content or word of mouth recommendations. Assisted sales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions. For mid-market businesses, we have implemented and expanded on our omnichannel go to market strategy by diversifying and growing our technology partner channel and industry focused direct sales teams.

Mobile Application Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. These include the Apple App Store and Google’s Play Store. 

Partner and Other Channels. We offer many of our products and services through partners including value-added resellers, system integrators (including accountants and marketing professionals), and managed service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software as well as payroll services at retail locations across the United States and Canada and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel.

COMPETITION

We face intense competition in all of our businesses in all aspects across all markets for our products and services, which are rapidly evolving, fragmented, and have complex interdependencies with many businesses. Competitive pressures in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. The competitive landscape is also constantly evolving as we expand into new market segments and new companies emerge and existing companies expand their capabilities (either directly or through acquisitions or partnerships) to include the markets in which we compete. Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company and the customer problems that we aim to serve, we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries, including large global companies, smaller geographically focused companies, startups and professional services. Our current global competitors include Blucora (TaxAct), Block, H&R Block, The Sage Group, Microsoft (Dynamics), Oracle (NetSuite) and Xero. Additional companies that may have offerings that we may compete with to solve some of our customer’s problems include:

•business software providers, such as those that provide accounting and financial software, website building, email marketing, inventory management, payroll and employee management;

•tax preparation services providers;

•accounting, consulting and tax firms; 

•government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers;

•software companies and banks that provide payments services, including merchant processing, checking, savings, loans, point of sale devices and lending; 

•software companies that provide personal finance management products and tools, including credit-score monitoring and personal financial services and content;

•companies that provide a marketplace of consumer financial offerings;

•financial institutions; 

•credit bureaus; and

•large platform companies, such as Meta, Amazon and Alphabet, that could develop competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face.

We believe our most important competitive factors are functionality, ease of use, high availability, security, the integration of these products with related software, brand name recognition, effective distribution, quality of support, and cost. We believe that we compete favorably based on these factors and our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance. 

CUSTOMER SUCCESS

For many of our offerings, we provide product support and technical support through channels including telephone, e-mail, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.

We also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation and bookkeeping services.

Our customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced small business customer success personnel are currently located in the Philippines.

We also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity in underserved communities. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.

Self-help information is offered for free in-product and on our support websites for many of our offerings. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24x7 support and additional contact channel options.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Online Products and Services

Our online offerings include QuickBooks Online, online payroll services, merchant payment processing services, Mailchimp’s e-commerce, marketing automation, and customer relationship management offerings, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Credit Karma offerings, and Mint. We completed the transition of our systems, networks and databases used to operate these online offerings to public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform.

 Intuit Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K10

Tables of Contents

Desktop Software and Supplies

Although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software, many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media. The key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs), printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products.

For retail manufacturing and distribution, we have agreements with Arvato Digital Services, Inc. (Arvato), a division of Bertelsmann AG, under which Arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of QuickBooks and TurboTax and day-to-day replenishment after product launches, as well as our retail distribution logistics. Arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders.

Customers typically receive desktop software electronically. However, when physical product is ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND WORKFORCE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS

We are stewards of our customers’ data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers’ data, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing and protection of customers’ personal information, including, for example, laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and members of our workforce are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security. 

We use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that customers and members of our workforce give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. We use technical, logical and procedural measures, such as multi-factor authentication, which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us, such as credit card information or tax return data through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Our Consumer and ProConnect segments are subject to federal, state and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment offers products and services to small businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, and financing, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. 

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit’s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Mint, Credit Karma, and Mailchimp. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

Although our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

HUMAN CAPITAL

We consider our employees one of our four True North key stakeholders because they help us deliver for our customers, our shareholders, and the communities we serve. As of July 31, 2022, we had approximately 17,300 employees in 10 countries. During fiscal 2022, we employed on average approximately 9,100 seasonal employees from January to April primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business. 

Intuit’s overall workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People & Places Officer, who reports to the CEO. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment, engagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity. Of the total number of employees, approximately 1,600 are employed by Credit Karma, which has certain unique compensation and workforce development programs. We regularly collect, measure and share the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including engagement surveys and other touch points, which help to guide the work we do to support our workforce.

Culture and Values

In order to deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create a culture where employees can do the best work of their lives. Our values and culture are woven into our hiring and retention practices and are foundational to our ability to attract, retain, and advance top, diverse talent.

•Our value of Integrity Without Compromise means valuing trust above all else, speaking the truth, and doing the right thing even when no one is looking.

•Our value of Courage means being bold and fearless in how we think and act, holding a high bar for performance and valuing speed, with a bias for learning and action. 

•Our value of Customer Obsession means falling in love with our customers’ problems and delivering solutions that delight our customers.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

At the foundation of our culture is a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). We believe that diversity is a fact, but treating people equitably and inclusively are choices we make. To deliver for our customers, we seek to foster a workforce that is as diverse as the communities we serve. When we do this, we believe we develop deeper empathy, accelerating innovation to solve the biggest problems our customers face. We have had a designated role dedicated to diversity and inclusion since 2015 and our Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer (CDEIO) leads a dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. Our Compensation and Organizational Development Committee oversees Intuit’s DEI initiatives in support of organizational development. Intuit’s strategy is operationalized through the following elements:

•Goals and transparency: Intuit has set short- and long-term goals for increasing the representation in our workforce of women and employees from underrepresented racial groups (which we define as Black/African-American, Latinx/Hispanic, Native American, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian). Our diversity data is shared with all employees, and progress on our goals is reviewed monthly with all executives. We also publicly disclose our progress on our goals and the breakdowns of the diversity of gender and underrepresented racial groups in our workforce both in the aggregate and among our leadership and technology roles;

•Center of Excellence: The CDEIO leads a cross-functional team with expertise in enterprise leadership, strategy, human resources and communications all focused on driving a more diverse and inclusive workplace;

•Employee Resource Groups: Intuit’s employee resource groups aid in creating community, recruiting, on-boarding and providing safe spaces for our diverse workforce;

•Engagement: Intuit conducts a dedicated DEI survey focused on the experiences of our workforce;

•REAL Team: Intuit has a Racial Equity Leadership Team that is focused on helping us drive durable change as we strive to continue advancing racial equity and equality;

•Education: All senior leaders have attended multiple DEI workshops, including C-suite training on racial equity. We have manager and employee training on leading inclusively and a guide for managers on how to have conversations about difficult and polarizing external events;

•Talent acquisition: Intuit has established a dedicated team to drive diversity, equity and inclusion across our hiring practices, programs and strategies. We have also invested in new, external partnerships to better engage with diverse talent and communities; and

•Accountability: The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee reviews our progress towards our goals and workforce diversity initiatives at least annually.

We strive to reward employees with compensation that is market competitive, fair and equitable across gender, race and ethnicity. We invest in this commitment by performing pay equity analyses twice a year using independent, third-party vendors. We are transparent about our pay equity results and have multiple avenues for employees to use for any questions about their pay. 

Developing Talent and Training 

We are committed to creating a high-performing culture that consistently delivers for our customers, shareholders and communities while providing an experience for our workforce that values leadership, innovation, and collaboration. We promote the development of all of our employees and provide employees with access to learning plans based on their needs and interests and the resources they need to grow, thrive and reinvent themselves over time. 

In addition, we are invested in growing our current and future leaders. Our teams design programs and resources to develop the leadership skills of our employees and measure their progress.

All full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through company-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to manager essentials in support of an employee’s ability to adapt to any work environment.

Employees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during performance assessment conversations and ongoing regular check-ins.

Employee Listening & Engagement

Listening and responding to our employees is at the core of our work. We value employee feedback and we leverage it to continuously improve the employee experience. We regularly collect, measure and share the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including engagement surveys, and other touch points, which help to guide the work we do to support our workforce.

Total Rewards 

Our compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit’s total target compensation includes base hourly pay or salary at market-competitive rates, a range of incentive plans that vary based on role, and equity grants. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay for performance philosophy and closely align with company performance and reward top performance. Most year-round employees are eligible for equity, which allows the majority of our employees to share in the company’s success.

Additional benefits and rewards include healthcare, retirement benefits, and paid time off including annual paid recharge days and family and parental leave.

The health and well-being of our employees and their families continues to be a top priority. We offer our employees access to programs to support their physical, emotional and financial well-being. Employees also have access to other resources to help with their well-being, including resilience, mindfulness and counseling programs, wellness reimbursement programs, back-up childcare, financial education programs and access to an employee assistance program.

Hybrid Way of Working 

After shifting to working virtually during the pandemic to keep our workforce safe, we are now embracing and transitioning to hybrid work at Intuit. Our hybrid work model brings the best of in-person collaboration and connections together with the flexibility of virtual work. Self-directed teams are empowered to decide where/when in-person work is accretive to their work. Across the company, we expect teams to spend a portion of their time working on campus. This hybrid way of working invests in and amplifies Intuit’s culture. In doing so, we seek to realize a sense of connectedness and belonging; to spark creativity and innovation; to solve for speed, agility, and productivity; and to attract and retain top, diverse talent to the company.
