General Development of Business

Summary Description of Chevron 

Chevron Corporation,* a Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.

A list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented in Exhibit 21.1.

Overview of Petroleum Industry 

Petroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals. 

Operating Environment 

Refer to pages 32 through 40 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.

Chevron’s Strategic Direction

Chevron’s strategy is to leverage its strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. The company’s primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the company’s strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer needs. Chevron aims to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer relationships.

________________________________________________________

* Incorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and "its" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.

Human Capital Management

Chevron invests in its employees and culture, with the objective of developing the full potential of its workforce to deliver energy solutions and drive human progress. The Chevron Way explains the company’s beliefs, vision, purpose and values. It guides how the company’s employees work and establishes a common understanding of culture and aspirations. Chevron hires, develops, and strives to retain a diverse workforce of high-performing talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity, inclusion and employee engagement. Chevron leadership is accountable for the company’s investment in people and the company’s culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, retention, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement.

The following table summarizes the number of Chevron employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2021. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Includes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender.

Hiring, Development and Retention

The company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a long-term employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. Chevron’s philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. Chevron recruits new employees in part through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills.

Chevron’s learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical, operating and leadership capabilities at all levels to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. Chevron’s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to meet the needs of our evolving business. For example, the company delivers learning experiences digitally to empower its employees, in any location, to develop, maintain and enhance critical skills. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning. 

Management routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The annual voluntary attrition for this population was 4.5 percent, which is in line with rates over a five-year comparison period. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company’s commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model, competitive pay and benefits, and its culture.

Diversity and Inclusion

Chevron believes innovative solutions to the most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the values of diversity and inclusion through recruitment and talent development, equitable selection processes, community partnerships and supplier diversity. Examples of 

4

initiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the company’s MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program launched in 2017 in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst to facilitate discussions on gender equity in the workplace, and selection processes that reinforce the importance of diverse selection teams and candidate slates. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and a Chairman’s Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevron’s values of diversity and inclusion.

Employee Engagement 

Employee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture; recent surveys indicate high employee engagement. In 2021, the company increased survey frequency to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year, including focused efforts to gain insights into employee well-being. Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Chevron’s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. Chevron developed new safeguards and operating standards and updated existing protocols to adjust for the ever-changing conditions of the pandemic, including a return to the workplace strategy, with paced, condition-based stages. The company also announced a hybrid work model based on employee feedback and learnings from the pandemic, which will allow certain employees the flexibility to combine in-office and remote work. Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns.

Refer to page 45 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures. 

Upstream 

Reserves 

Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company’s proved reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2019 and at each year-end from 2019 through 2021. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.

At December 31, 2021, 34 percent of the company’s net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 19 percent were located in Australia and 16 percent were located in Kazakhstan.

The net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2019 through 2021 are shown in the following table:

Delivery Commitments 

The company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas and crude oil sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities.

8

In the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver approximately 16 million barrels of crude oil and 759 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms. 

Outside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The sales contracts for Israel contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-linked or other, over the life of the contract. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.

Development Activities 

Refer to Table I for details associated with the company’s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2021, 2020 and 2019.

The following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at December 31, 2021. A “development well” is a well drilled within the known area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.

Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas 

Chevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2021 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 38, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in Exhibit 99.1. 

The discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment. 

United States

Upstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 8. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the table on page 7.

Chevron is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with a production outlook of more than one million barrels of net oil equivalent production per day by 2025. The company’s advantaged portfolio of development areas in west Texas and southeast New Mexico is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations. Chevron has implemented a Permian factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. Top tier drilling and completions performance has enabled year-over-year capital expenditure efficiency improvement and cycle time reduction generating higher returns throughout Chevron’s Permian portfolio. Chevron’s Permian operations have also demonstrated continual progress on its lower carbon and water goals, consistently ranking among the best Permian operators for methane emissions intensity, routine flaring, and water handling (utilizing 99 percent brackish or recycled sources). In 2021, Chevron’s net daily unconventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 284,000 barrels of crude oil, 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 148,000 barrels of NGLs. Conventional production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil, 39 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs per day. 

Chevron holds mature assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas that produced 29,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2021. 

In 2021, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 96,000 barrels. Chevron completed front-end engineering and design (FEED) in second quarter 2021 on a carbon capture project for emissions reduction from the gas turbines in one of our California co-generation facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologies—carbon dioxide concentration and carbon capture—and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. A final investment decision for this project is expected in third quarter 2022, with anticipated start-up in 2024. Chevron is also progressing the installation of a 20MWh battery at the solar power plant in the Lost Hills field with start-up expected in third quarter 2022.

In Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevron’s Mustang and Wells Ranch areas where the company’s comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. Chevron’s net daily production in the DJ Basin averaged 56,000 barrels of crude oil, 302 million cubic feet of natural gas and 36,000 barrels of NGLs during 2021.

Chevron also has operations in Colorado’s Piceance Basin as well as acreage positions in Wyoming and Utah.
