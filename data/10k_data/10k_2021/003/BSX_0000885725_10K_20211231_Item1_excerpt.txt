Markets

Competition

We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. In certain countries, we face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products, or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products. 

We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both differentiated clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a less-invasive and cost effective manner. We also compete on ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: 

•offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,

•create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,

•apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,

•develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,

•attract and retain qualified personnel, 

•obtain patent or other protection for our products,

•obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals,

•compete in regional and national tenders for our products,

•continually provide quality products and enhance our quality systems, 

•manufacture and market our products and solutions either directly or through third parties, and 

•supply sufficient inventory at competitive prices to meet customer demand.

Research and Development 

Our investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. Our investment in research and development supports the following:

•internal research and development programs, regulatory design and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances, and

•engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.

We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming how we conduct research and development by identifying best practices, driving efficiencies and optimizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept-to-market timelines. Focused, cross-functional teams take a formal approach to new product design and development, helping us to manufacture and offer innovative products consistently and efficiently. Involving cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows our teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and to maximize cost and time savings as we bring them to market.

In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaborations to include research and development teams in our emerging market countries; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that these efforts will play a significant role in our future success.

Marketing and Sales

In 2021, we marketed our products and solutions to approximately 35,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in more than 120 countries worldwide. Large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate accounts organization in the United States (U.S.) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators. We believe that this dual focus on disease state management and hospital administrators enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with both physicians and key service line administrators. We believe that our strong working relationships with physicians, service line administrators and others in the medical industry enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to our customers' changing needs. 

The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. 

International Operations

Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. We define Emerging Markets as the 20 countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and our global capabilities. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Periodically, we assess our list of Emerging Markets countries, and effective January 1, 2021, modified our list to include the following countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. Our Emerging Markets net sales represented 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021 and 11 percent in 2020.

As of December 31, 2021, we maintained various international manufacturing facilities, in addition to our facilities in the U.S. & Puerto Rico, in Ireland, Costa Rica, Brazil, Malaysia, Israel, Canada, the U.K. and Switzerland. In 2021, approximately 50 

10

percent of our manufactured products were produced at these international facilities. We also maintain research and development capabilities in Canada, China, Costa Rica, India, Ireland and Israel, and provide localized training programs through our Institutes for Advancing Science (IAS) facilities around the world.

Resources

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We strive to improve the efficiency of our sourcing operations and to leverage the technical expertise of the broader market by partnering with strategic suppliers. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and training and tools for our operations team. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities. 

We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments to ensure supply chain stability. We have an ongoing supplier resiliency program which identifies and mitigates risk and have taken measures to mitigate the impact of challenges within the global supply chain resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing, sterilization and distribution capabilities and partnerships and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We have recently experienced increased levels of unpredictability in the supply of certain raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products. While we continue to believe we will have access to the raw materials and components that we need, these supply chain dynamics could result in increased costs to us or an inability to fully meet customer demand for certain of our products. 

On an on-going basis, we track supplier status and inventory in risk areas and take action to prevent shortages, monitoring safety stock levels and building up product supplies as warranted, and mitigating risk of technology and material shortages by identifying new vendors. Our approach to supplier selection involves building diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the Boston Scientific supplier network. We are committed to the increased and sustained support of diverse businesses that share our dedication to improving the quality of patient care. As part of our strategy to combat racism, we have taken steps to further expand the number of Black-owned enterprises that provide supply chain services for our business in the U.S. We are also supporting small and diverse vendors by shortening payment terms for those whose business with us is under $250,000.

Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and other countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2021, we held more than 18,000 patents and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.

We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. 

We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence 

11

of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2021 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. 

Regulatory Environment

Medical Device Regulatory Approvals

The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device. 

In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.

The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA may seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.

The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). A HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE must demonstrate that the device does not expose the patient to unreasonable risk and that the benefit of device use outweighs the risk. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.

In the European Union (EU), we are required to comply with the Medical Device Regulation (MDR or EU MDR) which became effective May 2021, superseding existing Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the prior Directives (issued before May 2021) can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The CE Mark, which is required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following a Conformity Assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on device risk classification. CE marking indicates conformity to the applicable General Safety and Performance Requirements (GSPRs) for the MDR. The MDR changes multiple aspects of the regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements, changes to labelling, and new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (UDI), and many new post-market reporting obligations. MDR also modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the medical device industry and will continue to require significant investment over the next few years to transition all products by May 2024. The CE mark continues to be a prerequisite for successful registration in many other global geographies. 

We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market, such as the requirements that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), through the review at Japanese Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Agency (PMDA). Regulatory requirements are becoming more stringent, with the China National Medical Product Administration (NMPA) recently increasing the regulatory requirements to market and maintain products in China, and the introduction of such regulatory requirements in many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations. As a result of the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union (EU), we also 

12

expect a U.K. Regulation to be implemented beginning July 2023, with requirements to sell in the U.K. already in place including appointment of a U.K. Responsible Person and device registration with The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). In addition, other EU countries continue to impose significant local registration requirements despite the implementation of MDR. 

The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order recall or market withdrawal of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act, pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China, for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.

Quality Assurance

We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers and the patients they serve. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. Our quality system is also designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the U.S. FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our medical device manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor, and maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.

Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement

We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies that may potentially impact the Company, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state Governors, legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers to improve patient care and to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general. The Government Affairs office also advocates for public policy that benefits our employees and the patients we serve, and supports the communities in which we live. 

Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to place increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to 

13

demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies may now take longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption.

We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as price transparency, expansion of site neutrality, or consistent reimbursement regardless of treatment location, alternative payment reform, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs), continue to take shape in the U.S. and abroad. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of regional and national tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., China, Australia, and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may make it less likely that a hospital or physician will select our products to treat patients. 

Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients. Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures. The current U.S. Administration may support the introduction of healthcare legislation, or take regulatory action, that could lead to significant changes to Medicare's reimbursement practices defined in the inpatient prospective payment system, outpatient prospective payment system, ambulatory surgical center, and/or Physician Fee Schedule rules. At this point, the impact of any such changes are unclear as specific changes have not been introduced or promulgated.

Environmental Regulation and Management 

We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that strong performance across relevant environmental, health and safety metrics enhances our competitive strength while benefiting our patients, customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas with a goal of reducing pollution, minimizing depletion of natural resources and reducing our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. Refer to Corporate Sustainability included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.

Human Capital

At Boston Scientific, our work is guided by core values that define our culture and empower our employees, including Caring, Diversity, Global Collaboration, High Performance, Meaningful Innovation and Winning Spirit. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 41,000 employees, including approximately 16,000 in operations, 20,000 in selling, marketing, distribution and administration, and 5,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development. Of these employees, we employed approximately 21,000 outside the U.S., approximately 10,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function. We believe the collective talent of our employees and our shared corporate culture and values give us a competitive advantage.

Hiring, developing and retaining talented employees are key parts of our strategy and are critical to our success, particularly in the current environment of labor shortages and unprecedented job market conditions. We strive to do this by fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, providing competitive pay and benefits and flexible work conditions, offering ongoing employee growth and development opportunities and cultivating a culture that prioritizes employee health, safety and wellness.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 

We do our best work to advance health care when we have a diverse range of perspectives and experience on our team. Innovation thrives in a culture of engagement, inclusion and equity. The society in which we live and the customers and patients we serve are diverse and our employees at all levels of the organization must reflect this. In recent years, we have made steady progress to increase the overall representation of employees who identify as women and as African American/Black, Asian, Hispanic/Latinx, American Indian/Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races (together, multicultural talent). As of December 31, 2021, women represented 30 percent of our Board of Directors, and 48 percent of our employees. In addition, 36 percent of employees in the U.S. and Puerto Rico identified as multicultural. 

14

We are committed to our goal of making further progress toward expanding our workforce diversity. We have set measurable Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) goals with our “3UP by 2023” initiative, including a three percentage point increase in representation of both women and multicultural talent at the supervisor and manager level to 43 percent and 23 percent, respectively by December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, 41 percent of management roles were held by women and, within the U.S and Puerto Rico, 22 percent were held by multicultural employees. Our Executive Committee and our Board of Directors have oversight over employee diversity metrics and hiring trends. As evidence of our commitment to expand diversity, equity and inclusion, in 2021, we introduced a human capital performance metric to our Annual Bonus Plan. 

In addition, our nine Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) are at the heart of our DE&I strategy. ERGs are voluntary, company-sponsored employee groups that foster and celebrate our diverse work environment. They provide forums for us to learn from one another, celebrate our differences and develop inclusive leadership skills. We support each ERG by designating global and local executive sponsors and providing financial resources. Our ERG chapters around the world collaborate across the business at all levels and are powerful voices for change in the company.

We are proud to be a globally recognized leader for workplace inclusion, achieving top marks on Disability:IN’s 2021 Disability Equality Index (DEI), the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index (CEI) for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ)+ Equality, the JUST Capital Top 100 list of Companies Supporting Healthy Families and Communities, the Forbes Best Employer for Women 2021 list, as well as ranked in the top 10 of Forbes's list of America's Best Employers for Diversity. We also received the prestigious Catalyst award in 2022, in recognition of our organizational DE&I initiatives that drive representation and inclusion for women. 

Compensation and Benefits

We offer competitive, performance-based compensation programs, recognizing that employee well-being, safety, culture, engagement and recognition are all critical to a healthy work environment and productive workforce. We offer programs that acknowledge, respect and support an individual’s life and work choices. Our holistic programs are guided by overall workforce health, focusing on physical, financial and emotional well-being as well as a healthy work environment. We believe that investing in employee well-being leads to improved performance for the individual and the organization. 

As part of our broader rewards portfolio, we offer competitive pay and benefits that are flexible and affordable to meet the individual needs of our employees. In addition to cash-based salaries, our rewards portfolio includes cash bonus programs, sales incentives, stock awards, recognition awards, health insurance, paid time off and family leave, retirement savings plans, childcare and Employee Assistance Programs that encourage overall well-being, including help with finances, inclusive family planning and support, elder/child care, legal support and mental health.

Equal pay for equal work is rooted in our values and foundational to fostering an inclusive environment. Pay equity is an important part of our long-standing global compensation planning practices. Sustaining pay equity requires constant measurement and attention, so we regularly conduct comprehensive audits, internal and external analyses and company-wide benchmarking of salaries to identify and eliminate disparities. In addition, we periodically contract with an independent, third party to assess pay equity across all positions. In 2021, we again reported no statistically significant pay disparity for approximately 99 percent of our employees across gender globally and for multicultural talent in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We continue to educate and train our people, update policies and expand benefits to decrease bias, increase gender and racial representation within our organization, and foster a culture where all employees feel valued and included.

Employee Health and Safety

We take a global approach to prioritizing and monitoring employee safety and we strive to foster a safety-oriented culture in all of our offices and facilities. We set health and safety goals which measure the number of injuries per 100 employees for every manufacturing and distribution site. Our Employee Health & Safety Operations Council reviews performance monthly to discuss trends and risks, as well as opportunities for improvement. We have established a company-wide safety goal of 0.25 or fewer injuries per 100 employees by 2030, cutting our year-over-year incident rate by approximately 50 percent.

Employee Growth and Development

Developing our people professionally is one of the most important things we do. We have robust succession planning to ensure our future leaders are ready to assume roles as they become available. At every level of the company, employees have access to training and tools they can use to advance their skills and expertise and create greater possibilities for their careers. We offer professional and technical courses, including on-the-job training, skills-based learning, mentoring opportunities and leadership development programs for high-potential employees.

15

Employee Engagement

We seek ongoing feedback from our employees to better understand what we are doing well and, conversely, how we can improve their experience. In addition to encouraging ongoing communication and feedback between employees and their managers, we conduct periodic employee engagement surveys to ensure all employees have an opportunity to share their insights and we take appropriate action in response. 

Community Outreach

We are united by a goal to make a difference in the lives of the over 30 million patients we serve annually. We seek to give our time, talent and resources to make positive impacts upon those communities where we live, work, and serve. Guided by our core values, we seek to improve access to healthcare, to invest in educational programming and opportunities for underserved and underrepresented minority students, and to embrace the spirit of volunteerism within our global workforce, while adhering to strong ethical standards. 

In some parts of the world, access to health information, screening, care and services can be limited. Our collaborations with non-profit community organizations raise awareness of chronic disease and decrease these health disparities by improving health outcomes for underserved populations. We accomplish this through our focus on 3 P’s - Prevent, Provide and Prepare. We work to prevent chronic disease through education and awareness, provide access to healthcare through increasing the quantity and quality of healthcare workers and screenings, and preparing and empowering children at high risk of or who already have a chronic disease to successfully navigate their health journey. Since 2016, we have partnered with organizations like Children’s HeartLink, Project HOPE, Partners in Health, and Population Services International to support health equity for populations across the globe. 

Within many of the communities in which we operate, we have launched and funded a multi-year program to combat racism, inequity and injustice focused on five pillars: community, economic empowerment, education, healthcare disparities and government policies. We also continue our long-term Close the Gap initiative, which focuses on raising awareness and empowering healthcare providers to reach more patients of color, fight longstanding inequities, and address barriers to care. Through Close the Gap, hospitals and health systems are provided with zip code level data that highlight the disease prevalence and disparities occurring in their communities. The information, along with our health equity resources, allows health care administrators and providers to focus on improving care to underserved populations within their communities. 

We are also passionate about inspiring young learners to see themselves in a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) role in the future. Employees on our 17 global STEM teams worldwide work with underrepresented K-12 students to share their passion for STEM by providing interactive product demos, development programs, and hands-on activities for young learners in their communities. Through our outreach efforts, we are helping to develop the diverse future talent that will enable Boston Scientific and the greater healthcare community to create innovative health solutions for generations to come.

Beyond the classroom, we empower our employees to participate in and influence the way we care for people in their local communities. Many employees chose to support their communities through the use of the Employee Matching Gifts program. Through their contributions and the Boston Scientific match, more than $1 million was donated to causes employees cared most about across the world. In addition, as employees looked to engage in their communities safely, we provided several virtual volunteer opportunities and resources as well as limited in person opportunities where appropriate. These opportunities included at-home kit packing, virtual classroom and tutoring platforms, and volunteer days of service. We are proud of our collective efforts and the impact we have on advancing possibilities across the globe. 

We also support the U.S. communities where we have significant business presences through the Boston Scientific Foundation. The mission of the Foundation is simple: to help expand access to quality healthcare and educational opportunities for underserved populations. The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded scholarships to children of employees and grant awards across the U.S. in 2021. Employee volunteers evaluated proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval, upon which the Boston Scientific Foundation was able to help fuel grassroots innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve.

Seasonality

Our net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While our consolidated 

16

net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases of our medical devices have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.
