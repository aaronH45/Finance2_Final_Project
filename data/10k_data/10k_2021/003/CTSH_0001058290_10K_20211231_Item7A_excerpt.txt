Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of doing business as we transact or hold a portion of our funds in foreign currencies, particularly the Indian rupee. Accordingly, we periodically evaluate the need for hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to mitigate the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and expect to continue to use such instruments in the future to reduce foreign currency exposure to changes in the value of certain foreign currencies. All hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to regularly reviewed policies and procedures.

Revenues from our clients in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Rest of World represented 8.9%, 10.3% and 7.1%, respectively, of our 2021 revenues, and are typically denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, our revenues may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates, primarily the British pound and the Euro, as compared to the U.S. dollar.

A significant portion of our costs in India are denominated in the Indian rupee, representing 21.2% of our global operating costs during 2021, and are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have an impact on our results of operations.

We have entered into a series of foreign exchange forward and option contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of certain Indian rupee denominated payments in India. These U.S. dollar / Indian rupee hedges are intended to partially offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future operating costs. As of December 31, 2021, the notional value and weighted average contract rates of these contracts by year of maturity were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2021, the net unrealized gain on our outstanding foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $66 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2021, which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges of approximately $249 million.

A portion of our balance sheet is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which may result in non-operating foreign currency exchange gains or losses upon remeasurement. In 2021, we reported foreign currency exchange losses, exclusive of hedging losses, of approximately $33 million, which were primarily attributed to the remeasurement of net monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of our subsidiaries. We use foreign exchange forward contracts that are scheduled to mature in 2022 to provide an economic hedge against balance sheet exposure to certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary. At December 31, 2021, the notional value of these outstanding contracts was $847 million and the net unrealized loss was $4 million. Based upon a sensitivity analysis of our foreign exchange forward contracts at December 31, 2021, which estimates the fair value of the contracts assuming certain market exchange rate fluctuations, a 10.0% change in the foreign currency exchange rate against the U.S. dollar with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a change in the fair value of approximately $21 million.

Interest Rate Risk

We have a Credit Agreement providing for a $750 million unsecured Term Loan and a $1,750 million unsecured revolving credit facility, which are due to mature in November 2023. We are required under the Credit Agreement to make scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan. 

The Credit Agreement requires interest to be paid, at our option, at either the ABR, the Eurocurrency Rate or the Daily Simple RFR (each as defined in the Credit Agreement), plus, in each case, an Applicable Margin (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Initially, the Applicable Margin is 0.875% with respect to Eurocurrency Rate and Daily Simple RFR and 0.00%

with respect to ABR loans. Subsequently, the Applicable Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Rate and Daily Simple RFR may range from 0.75% to 1.125%, depending on our public debt ratings (or, if we have not received public debt ratings, from 0.875% to 1.125%, depending on our Leverage Ratio, which is the ratio of indebtedness for borrowed money to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Term Loan is a Eurocurrency loan. Thus, our debt exposes us to market risk from changes in interest rates. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our interest expense. A 10.0% change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, would have an immaterial effect on our reported interest expense. 

Information provided by the sensitivity analysis of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk does not necessarily represent the actual changes that would occur under normal market conditions.
