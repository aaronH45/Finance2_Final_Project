ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.

Commodity Prices

Our net sales, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogen-based products are sensitive to changes in selling prices as well as changes in the prices of natural gas and other raw materials unless these costs have been fixed or hedged. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, granular urea, UAN (32%) and AN by approximately $33, $22, $14 and $16, respectively.

Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. At certain times, we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivative instruments that we may use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options. These derivatives settle using primarily a NYMEX futures price index, which represents the basis for fair value at any given time. The contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods. As of December 31, 2021, we had natural gas derivative contracts covering certain periods through March 2022.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had open derivative contracts for 60.0 million MMBtus and 34.1 million MMBtus, respectively. A $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at December 31, 2021 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of $35 million, and a $1.00 per MMBtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by $35 million.

From time to time we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities.

Interest Rates

As of December 31, 2021, we had five series of senior notes totaling $3.50 billion of principal outstanding with maturity dates of June 1, 2023, December 1, 2026, March 15, 2034, June 1, 2043 and March 15, 2044. The senior notes have fixed interest rates. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately $3.47 billion and $4.11 billion, respectively. 

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear current market rates of interest and we are subject to interest rate risk on such borrowings. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 or 2020. Maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement during 2020 were $500 million. The weighted-average annual interest rate of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement during 2020 was 2.05%. 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We are directly exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro. We generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies.
