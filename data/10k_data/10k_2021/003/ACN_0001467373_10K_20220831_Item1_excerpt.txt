During fiscal 2022, we continued to make significant investments—in strategic acquisitions, in research and development (R&D) in our assets, platforms and industry and functional solutions, and in attracting, retaining and developing people. These investments help us to further enhance our differentiation and competitiveness in the marketplace. Our disciplined acquisition strategy, which is an engine to fuel organic growth, is focused on scaling our business in high-growth areas; adding skills and capabilities in new areas; and deepening our industry and functional expertise. In fiscal 2022, we invested $3.4 billion across 38 strategic acquisitions, $1.1 billion in R&D, and $1.1 billion in learning and professional development. At year-end, we had more than 8,300 patents and pending patent applications worldwide.

Our Strategy

The core of our growth strategy is delivering 360° value to our clients, people, shareholders, partners and communities. Our strategy defines the areas in which we will drive growth, build differentiation via 360° value and enable our business to create that value every day. We define 360° value as delivering the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients’ employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients.

We bring industry specific solutions and services as well as cross industry expertise and leverage our scale and global footprint, innovation capabilities, and strong ecosystem partnerships together with our assets and platforms including MyWizard, MyNav and SynOps to deliver tangible value for our clients.

We help our clients use technology to drive enterprise-wide transformation, which includes:

•building their digital core—such as moving them to the cloud, leveraging data and artificial intelligence, and embedding security across the enterprise;

•optimizing their operations—such as helping our clients digitize faster, access digital talent and reduce costs as well as through digitizing engineering and manufacturing; and

•accelerating their revenue growth—such as through using technology and creativity to create personalized connections, experiences and targeted sales at scale, leveraging data and AI, transforming content supply chains and marketing and commerce models and helping create new digital services and business models.

Our managed services have become increasingly strategic as companies seek to move faster and leverage our digital platforms and talent as well as reduce costs.

We believe our strategy to deliver 360° value makes us an attractive destination for top talent, a trusted partner to our clients and ecosystem, and a respected member of our communities.

We believe that the companies that will lead in the next decade need to harness the five key forces of change we have identified—total enterprise reinvention, talent, sustainability, the metaverse continuum and the ongoing technology revolution. We are investing and co-creating with clients and partners to lead in helping our clients thrive across these forces, which we expect to have different time horizons. Today, the strong demand we continue to see across our geographic markets, services and industries is being primarily driven by the first two, as companies are in the early stages of harnessing these forces. We have summarized below each of the five key forces as we currently see them evolving.

•Total enterprise reinvention, as we believe every part of every business must be transformed by technology, data and AI, with new ways of working and engaging with customers, employees and partners, and new business models, products and services. We are helping clients build their digital core, optimize operations and accelerate growth. 

•Talent, as companies must be able to access great talent, be talent creators not just consumers, and unlock the potential of their people—from the ways they organize and work, to their culture, to their employee value proposition.

•Sustainability, as consumers, employees, business partners, regulators and investors are demanding companies move from commitment to action—we believe every business must be a sustainable business.
ACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 1. Business4

•The metaverse continuum, moving seamlessly between virtual and physical, which we believe will provide even greater possibilities in the next waves of digital transformation. 

•The ongoing technology revolution, from the rich innovation to come in the powerful technologies being used to transform companies today, to the new fields of the future, from quantum computing, to science and space technology.

We believe that helping clients navigate these five key forces of change will, in turn, drive our growth.

Key enablers of our growth strategy include:

Our People—As a talent- and innovation-led organization, across our entire business our people have highly specialized skills that drive our differentiation and competitiveness. We care deeply for our people, and are committed to a culture of shared success, to investing in our people to provide them with boundaryless opportunities to learn and grow in their careers through their work experience and continued development, training and reskilling, and to helping them achieve their aspirations both professionally and personally.

Our Foundation—Our Leadership Essentials set the standard for what we expect from our people. Our growth model, which leverages our global sales, client experience and innovation, while organizing around geographic markets and industry groups within those markets, enables us to be close to our clients, people and partners to scale efficiently. Our enduring shareholder value proposition is also a key element of the foundation that enables us to execute on our growth strategy through the financial value it creates. 

Geographic Markets

Our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets, bring together integrated service teams, which typically consist of industry and functional experts, technology and capability specialists and professionals with local market knowledge and experience, to meet client needs. The geographic markets have primary responsibility for building and sustaining long-term client relationships; bringing together our expertise from around the globe and collaborating across our business to sell and deliver our full range of services and capabilities; ensuring client satisfaction; and achieving revenue and profitability objectives.

While we serve clients in locally relevant ways, our global footprint and scale in every major country give us the ability to leverage our experience and people from around the world to accelerate outcomes for our clients.

People

Overview

We are a talent- and innovation-led organization with over 721,000 people as of August 31, 2022, whose skills and specialization are a significant source of competitive differentiation. We serve clients at any given time in more than 120 countries, with offices and operations in 49 countries. The majority of our people are in India, the Philippines and the U.S. We have a culture of shared success, which is defined as success for our clients, our people, our shareholders, our partners and our communities. That culture is built upon four tangible building blocks—our beliefs, our behaviors, the way we develop and reward our people and the way we do business.

Our Beliefs and Behaviors 

Our leadership essentials set the standard for what we expect of all our people:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]Listening to the voices of our people provides the input to ensure that they have the tools and resources to do their jobs and the right learning opportunities, and that they experience a positive, respectful and inclusive work environment. We do this on an ongoing basis across various channels, including surveys and forums. One of our surveys indicates that 83% of global respondents feel comfortable being themselves at work.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]
ACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 1. Business9

The Way We Develop and Reward Our People 

Our focus is to create talent and unlock the potential of our people, to create strong leaders, and to help them achieve their professional and personal aspirations, while continuously pivoting to meet new client demands. During fiscal 2022, we invested $1.1 billion in continuous learning and development so our people remain highly relevant. With our digital learning platform, we delivered over 40 million training hours, an increase of 27% compared with fiscal 2021, with an average of approximately 61 hours of training per person. We have skills data for our people, enabling us to flexibly respond to shifting client needs while also recommending skill-specific training based on an individual’s interests. We are also focused on rigorous, job-specific training through key industry certifications and partnerships with leading universities around the globe. We also train our people in inclusion and diversity.

We promoted approximately 157,000 people in fiscal 2022, demonstrating our continued commitment to creating vibrant careers and opportunities for our people. 

We balance our supply of skills with changes in client demand. We do this through adjusting levels of new hiring and managing our attrition (both voluntary and involuntary). We believe people are drawn to our strong purpose, values and reputation. During fiscal 2022, we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have, which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition. For fiscal 2022, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 14% in fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 20%, flat with 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. In fiscal 2022, we increased our workforce by approximately 100,000 people. 

Accenture’s total rewards consist of cash compensation, equity and a wide range of benefits. Our total rewards program is designed to recognize our people’s skills, contributions and career progression. Base salary, bonus and equity are tailored to the market where our people work and live. Certain rewards, like equity and bonuses, are opportunities for our people to share in the overall success of our company. As our people advance in their careers, they have greater opportunities to be rewarded. Accenture’s equitable rewards go beyond financial rewards and include health and well-being programs that care for our people.

The Way We Do Business

At Accenture, our people care deeply about doing the right thing. Together, we have proven that we can succeed—providing value to our clients and shareholders and opportunities for our people—while being a powerful force for good. Our shared commitment to operating with the highest ethical standards and making a positive difference in everything we do is what we believe differentiates Accenture. We believe in transparency, that transparency builds trust, and that we must earn the trust of our clients, our people, our partners and our communities each and every day.

Our Code of Business Ethics is organized into six fundamental behaviors: Make Your Conduct Count; Comply with Laws; Deliver for Our Clients; Protect People, Information and Our Business; Run Our Business Responsibly; and Be a Good Corporate Citizen. It applies to all our people—regardless of their title or location. With our Code of Business Ethics, we want to help our people make ethical behavior a natural part of what we do every day—with each other, our clients, our partners and our communities.

Accenture’s commitment to and focus on our people and culture has generated significant recognition, including No. 1 on the Refinitiv Diversity & Inclusion Index for the third time in five years; Ethisphere’s World’s Most Ethical Companies for 15 consecutive years; and being named a Top 10 Great Place to Work® for 2022 in nine countries, representing 76% of our people.

Our Health, Safety and Well-Being

We are committed to creating a place where people can be successful both professionally and personally. We take a holistic view of well-being—including physical, mental, emotional and financial well-being—providing specially defined programs and practices to meet our people’s fundamental human needs. During fiscal 2022, our people have embraced omni-connected ways of working. According to a survey, 85% of our global respondents feel empowered to work flexibly within their teams.

We also continued to elevate our support for the well-being of our people with digital tools and initiatives to help them cope and to strengthen their mental resilience. Those programs include access to in-person and virtual counseling and support, to digital tools like Calm and Wysa, to our Mental Health Ally program and to our many Thrive Global programs, which collectively bring science-based solutions to lower stress, enhance well-being and productivity, and build resilience and belonging. Specifically relating to COVID-19, our people continue to benefit from the robust support established since the beginning of the pandemic.

Environmental Sustainability

We help our clients—the world’s leading businesses, governments and other organizations—together with our ecosystem partners, to define, measure and achieve their environmental, social and governance goals by connecting sustainability with their digital transformation agendas across their strategy and operations to make their value chains more sustainable.

We have a strong commitment to sustainability in the way we operate our business, and we hold ourselves accountable to clear and measurable objectives, including reaching net-zero emissions by 2025 with 100% renewable electricity by 2023, moving towards zero-waste including eliminating e-waste by 2025, and planning for water risk by 2025.

For more than a decade, we have continually set challenging environmental goals for ourselves, innovating our approach to environmental sustainability, and making strategic investments. In 2020, we signed the UN Global Compact’s Business Ambition and joined leading companies in pledging to do our part to keep global warming below 1.5° Celsius, in alignment with the Paris Agreement and the criteria and recommendations of the Science Based Targets initiative.

Net-Zero Emissions by 2025

To meet these commitments, we set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions by 2025 by first focusing on actual reductions across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions and then removing any remaining emissions through nature-based carbon removal offsets.

Carbon Reduction

The most significant aspects of our environmental footprint are the greenhouse gas emissions related to electricity used in our locations, as well as travel and purchased goods and services.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Carbon Removal

•Nature-based carbon removal. To offset our remaining emissions, we are investing in nature-based carbon removal solutions to directly remove over 13 million metric tons of carbon from the atmosphere from 2025 to 2041. 

In addition to our goal to achieve net zero emissions, we have made further environmental commitments to reduce waste and plan for water risk.
ACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 1. Business11

Moving Towards Zero Waste

To move towards zero waste, we have committed to:

•Reuse or recycle 100% of our e-waste, such as computers and servers, as well as all our office furniture, by 2025. During fiscal 2022, we reused or recycled 99% of our e-waste relating to computers and workstations. We continue our efforts to reuse or recycle other e-waste such as monitors and servers; and

•Eliminate single-use plastics in our locations. During fiscal 2022, we began pivoting to the purchase of durable and/or biodegradable reusable items in our office locations around the world.

Planning for Water Risk

Although Accenture is not a water-intensive company, we minimize our use of water wherever feasible, including responsible use, reuse, management, and discharge across our office portfolio. We are particularly conscious of our locations in water-stressed areas. To plan for water risk, we are developing plans to reduce the impact of flooding, drought and water scarcity on our business and our people in high-risk areas. In addition to developing water resiliency plans, we now measure, and report water use in these locations.

Global Delivery Capability

A key differentiator is our global delivery capability, powered by one of the world’s largest networks of Advanced Technology and Intelligent Operations Centers. This allows us to bring the right people at the right time to our clients from anywhere in the world—both in physical and virtual working environments—a capability that is particularly crucial as business needs and conditions change rapidly. Our global approach provides scalable innovation; standardized processes, methods and tools; automation and artificial intelligence; industry expertise and specialized capabilities; cost advantages; foreign language fluency; proximity to clients; and time zone advantages—to deliver high-quality solutions. Emphasizing quality, productivity, reduced risk, speed to market and predictability, our global delivery model supports all parts of our business to provide clients with price-competitive services and solutions. 

Innovation and Intellectual Property 

We are committed to developing leading-edge ideas and leveraging emerging technologies and we see innovation as a source of competitive advantage. We use our investment in R&D—on which we spent $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $871 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively—to help clients address new realities in the marketplace and to face the future with confidence.

Our innovation experts work with clients across the world to imagine their future, build and co-create innovative business strategies and technology solutions, and then scale those solutions to sustain innovation. We harness our unique intellectual property to deliver these innovation services.

We leverage patent, trade secret and copyright laws as well as contractual arrangements and confidentiality procedures to protect the intellectual property in our innovative services and solutions. These include our proprietary platforms, software, reusable knowledge capital, and other innovations. We also have policies to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties, such as our clients, partners, vendors and others. As of August 31, 2022, we had a portfolio of more than 8,300 patents and pending patent applications worldwide. 

We believe our combination of people, assets and capabilities, including our global network of more than 100 innovation hubs, makes Accenture one of the leading strategic innovation partners for our clients. We have deep expertise in innovation consulting including strategy, culture change and building new business models through to long-term technology innovation, which creates the products and markets of the future. 

This is all supported by our innovation approach, which includes Accenture Research, Accenture Ventures and Accenture Labs as well as our Studios, Innovation Centers and Delivery Centers. Our research and thought leadership teams help identify market, technology and industry trends. Accenture Ventures partners with and invests in growth-stage companies that create innovative enterprise technologies. Accenture Labs incubate and prototype new concepts through applied research and development projects. Within this, the Technology Incubation Group incubates and applies emerging technology innovation to business architectures, including blockchain, metaverse, extended reality and quantum.

To protect Accenture’s brands, we rely on intellectual property laws and trademark registrations held around the world. Trademarks appearing in this report are the trademarks or registered trademarks of Accenture Global Services Limited, Accenture Global Solutions Limited, or third parties, as applicable.
ACCENTURE 2022 FORM 10-KItem 1. Business12

Competition

Accenture operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing global marketplace. We compete with a variety of organizations that offer services and solutions competitive with those we offer—but we believe no other company offers the full range of services at scale that Accenture does, which uniquely positions us in a highly competitive market. Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 

Our competitors include large multinational IT service providers, including the services arms of large global technology providers; off-shore IT service providers in lower-cost locations, particularly in India; accounting firms and consultancies that provide consulting and other IT services and solutions; solution or service providers that compete with us in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including advertising agency holding companies, engineering services providers and technology start-ups; and in-house IT departments of large corporations that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm. 

We believe Accenture competes successfully in the marketplace because: 

•We are focused on delivering 360° value, which we define as the financial business case and unique value a client may be seeking, and striving to partner with our clients to achieve greater progress on inclusion and diversity, reskill and upskill our clients’ employees, help our clients achieve their sustainability goals, and create meaningful experiences, both with Accenture and for the customers and employees of our clients;

•We are a trusted partner with long-term client relationships and a proven track record for delivering from strategy to execution, on large, complex programs at speed that drive outcomes and tangible value; 

•We provide a broad range of services bringing together our capabilities at scale and have a significant presence in every major geographic market, enabling us to leverage our global expertise in a local context to deliver the best solutions, and our managed services help companies move faster by leveraging our digital platform and talent and reduce costs;

•The breadth and scale of our technology capabilities, combined with our strong relationships with our technology ecosystem partners, enable us to help clients transform and re-platform in a sustainable way at speed;

•We have deep industry and cross-industry expertise, which enable us to accelerate value as clients transform their products, customer experiences and optimize their operations;

•We continuously invest in advanced tools, methods and platforms, and the highly specialized skills of our people, to create repeatable industry and cross industry solutions and assets, that can scale at speed, leveraging our deep experience, knowledge and insights across industries, functions and services, often with our ecosystem partners; 

•Our industry-leading innovation approach—including Accenture Research, Accenture Ventures and Accenture Labs as well as our Studios, Innovation Centers and Delivery Centers—reflects our commitment to continuous innovation and enables us to rapidly identify, incubate, and scale emerging technology solutions for our clients;

•Our goal is to recruit the most talented people in our markets, and we have an unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity, which creates an environment that unleashes innovation, and a world-class learning organization that helps us continuously invest in the development of our people; and

•We believe our strategy to deliver 360° value makes us an attractive destination for top talent, a trusted partner to our clients and ecosystem, and a respected member of our communities.
