In each instance, the increased functionality and greater complexity increase RF content and favor high performance and highly integrated solutions.

Mobile device original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") are adopting UWB technology to enhance functionality, including indoor navigation and secure remote access, leveraging UWB's precision-location accuracy. They are also seeking to adopt force-sensing touch sensor technology to enhance human-machine touch interfaces, create new consumer experiences and advance industrial design.

Qorvo’s products for mobile devices include highly integrated RF solutions which incorporate filters, switches, amplifiers, multiplexers and other components in a single package. Our product portfolio also includes RF power management integrated circuits, UWB SoC and system-in-package ("SiP") solutions, MEMS-based sensors, antenna tuners, antennaplexers, as well as discrete multiplexers, duplexers, filters, and switches.

Cellular Base Stations 

Operators of cellular base stations are migrating to 5G in order to increase capacity, expand coverage and lower the cost per bit of data delivered. This is enabling new data-driven intelligent applications that combine global hyper-connectivity with artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. New use cases include industrial automation, robotics, remote medical care, autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality ("AR/VR").

5G networks operate over a wide range of frequencies, and deployments can vary with spectrum allocation, regional demographics, geopolitical considerations and other factors. In the U.S., the completion of C-band auctions signaled the start of significant growth for base stations in the sub-7 GHz frequency range. Many of these base stations will be configured with massive MIMO active antenna arrays which increase the number of RF transmit and receive channels. Base stations operating over millimeter wave frequencies are also being deployed to address the capacity requirements in high-density environments and improve applications such as fixed wireless access.

5
The continuing migration to 5G is increasing the content opportunity for Qorvo’s high-performance infrastructure products, including those featuring our gallium nitride ("GaN"), gallium arsenide ("GaAs") and bulk acoustic wave ("BAW") technologies. Qorvo supports the world’s leading cellular base station OEMs with a broad portfolio of infrastructure solutions to address requirements for increased data capacity and throughput and improved efficiency. Qorvo’s products for cellular base stations include switch-low noise amplifier ("LNA") modules, variable gain amplifiers, integrated power amplifier ("PA") Doherty modules, discrete LNAs and high power GaN amplifiers.

Power Management and Conversion 

Power efficiency is a core requirement in all electronics, and power management and power conversion are critical to enhancing efficiency. Industry trends in EVs/hybrid-EVs, renewable energy systems, battery-operated portable devices, EV chargers/on-board chargers, data storage, circuit protection and similar applications, are sharpening the focus on power efficiency and increasing the demand for our power management and power conversion solutions.

Qorvo’s SiC power devices provide state-of-the-art efficiency in a range of power conversion applications.

They reduce solution size, lower cost, improve system reliability and shorten our customers’ product development time. Our power management products manage voltages from 1.8V to 600V and power up to 4,000 watts.

Wireless Connectivity

The proliferation of data-driven connected devices that sense, process and communicate is increasing demand for wireless connectivity solutions that improve speed, capacity and efficiency. Use cases in consumer, commercial and industrial IoT applications include connected cars, cloud gaming, AR/VR, telemedicine and factory automation. Each benefit from faster throughput, lower latency, more security, greater reliability and smaller form factors.

IoT connected devices allow remote access and control of various functions, including entertainment, comfort, security, energy usage and health or general status monitoring, in home and office environments. These devices can be controlled through a computer, tablet or smartphone, or through a more direct peer-to-peer device such as a voice-enabled remote control.

In Wi-Fi, new standards feature higher order MIMO architectures and offer greater range and capacity. The adoption of new standards, such as 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), Wi-Fi 6E and Wi-Fi 7, increases data throughput and enable new use cases. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission approved the use of 5.9 GHz to 7.1 GHz spectrum for Wi-Fi 6E, and countries outside the U.S. are also making spectrum available for Wi-Fi 6E. The upcoming Wi-Fi 7 standard will double the channel bandwidth and number of spatial streams available with Wi-Fi 6E and use multi-link operation to combine portions of the 5 GHz and 6 GHz bands into a single link. This will enable faster speeds over longer distances than previous standards. As standards and architectures evolve, requirements increase for more functional and more highly integrated RF front end solutions. Qorvo’s Wi-Fi portfolio includes PAs, switches, LNAs and BAW filters, as well as integrated solutions including front end modules ("FEMs") and integrated FEMs.

In lower power applications, smart device OEMs increasingly prefer multi-protocol integrated SoCs that enable multiple radios to connect concurrently. The coexistence of low power wireless protocols, such as Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, and Thread, in single-placement SoCs reduces form factor, extends battery life and advances the proliferation of IoT devices. Similarly, Matter is an open and universal smart home protocol expected to simplify and accelerate interoperability across IoT devices and platforms. Lastly, new use cases leveraging the ultra-precise location accuracy and secure access enabled by UWB are advancing the proliferation of UWB in a widening range of applications.

6
These trends are increasing demand for Qorvo’s low power wireless and UWB solutions. Qorvo offers multi-standard (Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee and Thread) SoC solutions and single standard UWB SoC and SiP solutions, consisting of SoC hardware, firmware and application software.

We develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to reduce component size, improve performance and reduce package costs. We also invest in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes.

Raw Materials and Manufacturing

We purchase numerous raw materials and parts, such as silicon, passive components and substrates, for our manufacturing processes. In our GaN and GaAs manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including GaN on SiC wafers and GaAs wafers. In our acoustic filter manufacturing operations, raw materials include silicon, lithium niobate and lithium tantalate.

We procure our materials, parts and supplies from a large number of sources through established purchase contracts with suppliers or on a purchase order basis. As the semiconductor industry continued to experience supply constraints for certain items during fiscal 2022, we have entered into certain supply agreements to address short- and long-term supply requirements.

Our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external capacity. Our manufacturing sites are geographically distributed, as are our suppliers. We routinely qualify additional manufacturing sites and sources of supply to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases, and we closely monitor our suppliers’ key performance indicators. We seek to ensure that materials and manufacturing services are available from multiple sources and geographic locations.

The majority of our products are multi-chip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor and acoustic material processing technologies. These products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured internally or sourced from outside supply chain partners.

We operate fabrication facilities for the production of BAW, GaN, GaAs, SAW and Temperature Compensated SAW wafers in North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. We also use multiple silicon-based process technologies, including SOI, SiGe and bulk CMOS, which are principally sourced from leading silicon foundries located throughout the world. We have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day.

We have our own flip chip, wire bond and wafer-level packaging technologies. We primarily use internal assembly facilities in China, Costa Rica, Germany and the U.S., and we also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies.

Manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products, based on a number of factors, including product complexity, performance requirements and the maturity of our manufacturing processes. To maximize wafer yields and quality, we test products multiple times, maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow.

Our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs, consisting primarily of occupancy costs, maintenance, repair, equipment depreciation, and labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering.

Semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled and clean environments. Die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional or wafers can be rejected due to a number of reasons, including minute impurities, variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuit patterns onto the wafers.

Our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 9001 quality standard, and select locations are certified to additional automotive (IATF 16949), aerospace (AS 9100) and environmental (ISO 14001) standards. These stringent standards are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our continuous internal self-audits. The ISO 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation of top management, the process approach and continual improvement. IATF 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry. AS 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry. ISO 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system. We require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with applicable standards.

Intellectual Property

Our IP, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, is important to our business, and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our IP portfolio to promote our business interests. We also actively monitor and protect our global IP rights to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. These efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect IP rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. We respect the IP rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third-party IP.

Patent applications are filed within the U.S. and in other countries where we have a market presence. On occasion, some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons, including rejections based on prior art. We have approximately 2,200 patents that expire from 2022 to 2041. We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use third-parties’ patents. In view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted. However, we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business, which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other IP right. As we expand our products and offerings, we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products.

We periodically register federal trademarks, service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market. We also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use. Additionally, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage, including business strategies, unpatented inventions, designs and process technology. Such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information.
