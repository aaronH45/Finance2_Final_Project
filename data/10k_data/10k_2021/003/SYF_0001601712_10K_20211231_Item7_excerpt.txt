Highlights for the Year Ended December 31, 2021 

Below are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.

•Net earnings increased 204.8% to $4.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher retailer share arrangements and lower net interest income. Net earnings included the impact of reserve reductions related to held for sale portfolios of $261 million after-tax. 

•Loan receivables decreased 1.4% to $80.7 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the reclassification of loan receivables to loan receivables held for sale. Loan receivables held for sale at December 31, 2021 were comprised of $3.9 billion and $0.5 billion of loan receivables associated with our Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, respectively. Excluding the impact of the reclassifications, loan receivables increased 4% reflecting strong purchase volume growth, largely offset by higher payment rates.

•Net interest income decreased 1.1% to $14.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to a decrease in interest and fees on loans of 4.5%, reflecting the impact of elevated payment rates and lower delinquencies during the period, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense primarily reflecting lower benchmark interest rates.

•Retailer share arrangements increased 24.2% to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the decrease in provision for credit losses.

•Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased 45 basis points to 2.62% at December 31, 2021 from 3.07% at December 31, 2020. Excluding amounts related to the held for sale portfolios from both periods, the decrease compared to the prior year was approximately 60 basis points. The net charge-off rate decreased 166 basis points to 2.92% for the year ended December 31, 2021.

•Provision for credit losses decreased by $4.6 billion, or 86.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower reserves, which included $345 million of reserve reductions related to the held for sale portfolios, and lower net charge-offs. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit losses as a percentage of period-end loan receivables) decreased to 10.76% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 12.54% at December 31, 2020.

•Other expense decreased by $92 million, or 2.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower operational losses, partially offset by higher employee costs.

•At December 31, 2021, deposits represented 81% of our total funding sources. Total deposits decreased 0.8% to $62.3 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to December 31, 2020.

•During the year ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid cash dividends on our Series A 5.625% non-cumulative preferred stock of $56.24 per share, or $42 million.

•During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $2.9 billion of our outstanding common stock, and declared and paid cash dividends of $0.88 per common share, or $500 million. At December 31, 2021, we had $1.2 billion of remaining authorized share repurchase capacity under our existing share repurchase program. For more information, see “Capital—Dividend and Share Repurchases.”

•In February 2021 in our Health & Wellness sales platform, we completed our acquisition of Allegro Credit, a leading provider of point-of-sale consumer financing for audiology products and dental services.

Business Trends and Conditions

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:

•Growth in loan receivables and interest income. During 2021, accumulated savings by consumers resulting from economic stimulus, forbearance and lower discretionary spending, has led to elevated payment rates that were approximately 260 basis points higher than our five-year historical average. While we have experienced improvements in consumer purchase activity in 2021, the elevated payment rates contributed to a reduction in interest and fees and slower receivable growth in 2021. We expect purchase volume to continue to increase in 2022 as compared to the prior year, and also expect to see payment rates moderate over the course of 2022, which we expect will contribute to increases in both loan receivables and interest income for our ongoing program agreements. The amount of the increases however will be dependent on various factors. These factors include the timing and extent of slowing payment rates, as well as the nature of and duration for which any preventative or governmental measures are taken, including responses to increases in COVID-19 infections nationally or additional variants that may occur. In addition to the above, we anticipate conveyance of our Gap Inc. and BP portfolios to be completed in the second quarter of 2022, which will contribute to reductions in total interest and fees on loans when compared to 2021.

•Asset quality. During 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have driven significant improvement in customer payment behavior such that our asset quality metrics have seen historic lows during 2021. Our over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased to 2.62% at December 31, 2021 from 3.07% at December 31, 2020. We anticipate that the elevated payment trend we have experienced in 2021 will begin to moderate in 2022, such that we expect to incur increases to both delinquencies and net charge-offs as compared to current levels. We have also experienced decreases to both our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily attributable to the elevated payment rate trends, and our allowance coverage ratio at December 31, 2021 was 10.76%. As the economic environment develops during 2022, we anticipate that our credit loss reserve builds and provision for credit losses will be higher than those experienced in 2021. 

•Retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements. Retailer share arrangements increased 24.2% to $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the decrease in provision for credit losses discussed above. We believe that the payments we make to our partners under our retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, in 2022 are likely to decrease in absolute terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of the expected credit trends discussed above, as well as the impact from the disposition of our held for sale portfolios. This decrease will be partially offset by growth of the programs for which we have retailer share arrangements. The magnitude of the decrease in retailer share arrangements will be dependent in part on the precise timing and extent of the anticipated trends in payment rates and asset quality discussed above. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Retailer Share Arrangements for additional information on these agreements.

•Extended duration of our credit card program agreements. Our credit card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years, and the length of our relationship with each of our five largest partners is over 14 years, and in the case of Lowe's, 42 years. We expect to continue to benefit from these and our other ongoing programs on a long-term basis. 

The current expiration dates of our program agreements with our five largest partners range from 2026 through 2030. In addition, a total of 20 of our 25 largest ongoing program agreements have an expiration date in 2025 or beyond, which represented in the aggregate 96% of our interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 93% of our loan receivables at December 31, 2021, attributable to our 25 largest ongoing programs.

35

•Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our credit card partners’ locations, interchange revenues will increase in excess of the growth of our credit card loan receivables. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our credit card partners, partially offset by the impact from the disposition of our held for sale portfolios. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we typically do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our loyalty program costs were largely offset by our interchange revenues, although the increase in loyalty program costs exceeded the increase in interchange revenues. Overall, we expect these trends for our loyalty program costs and interchange revenues to continue in 2022. These changes have been contemplated in our program agreements with our partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.

•Capital and liquidity levels. We continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid dividends of $500 million and repurchased $2.9 billion of our outstanding common stock. We plan to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases, subject to regulatory restrictions, as well as to support business growth. At December 31, 2021 we had $1.2 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization. We continue to expect to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.6%, which reflects our election to defer the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital, which will now be phased-in over a three-year transitional period through December 31, 2024 and effects fully phased-in beginning in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this phase-in our common equity Tier 1 ratio will be reduced by 62 basis points in 2022.

We expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. As a result of lower growth in loan receivables primarily due to elevated payment rates, and strength in our deposit platform, we have generally been carrying a higher level of liquidity during 2021. We also expect to carry some excess liquidity in the second and third quarters of 2022 following the conveyance of our held for sale portfolios.

Seasonality

We experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down. 

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.

36

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

While the effects of the seasonal trends discussed above remain evident, we also continue to experience improvements in customer payment behavior, which include the effects of governmental stimulus actions, industry-wide forbearance measures and elevated consumer savings. Customer payments as a percentage of beginning-of-period loan receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately 260 basis points higher than our prior five-year historical average. These higher payment rates have resulted in reductions in loan receivables and delinquency rates beyond our seasonal expectations.

Interest Income

Interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.

We analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. Key drivers of average interest-earning assets include:

•purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners’ sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;

•payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;

•charge-offs, reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible;

•the size of our liquidity portfolio; and

•portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.

37

Key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:

•pricing (contractual rates of interest, movement in prime rates, late fees and merchant discount rates);

•changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);

•frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date;

•credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and

•yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.

Interest income decreased by $796 million, or 5.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease reflected the impact of improvements in customer payment behavior and lower delinquencies during the period, which resulted in lower loan receivable yield and lower average loan receivables.

Average interest-earning assets 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Average loan receivables, including held for sale, decreased 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, as the impact from the improvements in customer payment behavior was partially offset by purchase volume growth of 19.2%.

Yield on average interest-earning assets 

The yield on average interest-earning assets decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average loan receivables. The decrease in loan receivables yield was 61 basis points to 19.29% for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting the impact of higher payment rates and lower interest and fees. 

Interest Expense

Interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and senior unsecured notes.

Key drivers of interest expense include:

•the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

•the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and

•the changing mix in our funding sources.

Interest expense decreased by $633 million, or 38.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower benchmark interest rates. Our cost of funds decreased to 1.37% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2.07% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

38

Average interest-bearing liabilities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily driven by our efforts to mitigate excess liquidity in our business which resulted in decreases in our deposits, borrowings of our consolidated securitization entities, and senior unsecured notes.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense.

Net interest income decreased by $163 million, or 1.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting from the changes in interest income and interest expense discussed above.

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our program agreements with large retail and certain other partners contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. We also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for credit losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the growth and performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years.

We believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours. We also believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.

Retailer share arrangements increased by $883 million, or 24.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to the decrease in provision for credit losses. 

39

Provision for Credit Losses

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date. Provision for credit losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for credit losses. Our process to determine our allowance for credit losses is based upon our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for credit loss methodology. 

Provision for credit losses decreased by $4.6 billion, or 86.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower reserves, which included $345 million of reserve reductions related to the held for sale portfolios, and lower net charge-offs. 

Other Income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interchange revenue 

We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a percentage of the purchase amount. Interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products.

Interchange revenue increased by $228 million, or 35.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, driven by an increase in purchase volume outside of our retail partners' sales channels.

Debt cancellation fees 

Debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. 

Debt cancellation fees increased by $6 million, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of increases in customer enrollment.

Loyalty programs 

We operate a number of loyalty programs that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. Growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.

Loyalty programs cost increased by $343 million, or 52.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily as a result of growth in purchase volume associated with existing loyalty programs. 

40

Other 

Other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees, commission fees related to Pets Best, changes in the fair value of equity investments, realized gains or losses associated with the sale of investments or other assets and changes in contingent consideration obligations.

Other increased by $185 million, or 149.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to investment gains and higher commission fees related to Pets Best.

Other Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Employee costs 

Employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.

Employee costs increased by $121 million, or 8.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by higher stock-based compensation expense and higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the prior year restructuring charge of $41 million. 

Professional fees 

Professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.

Professional fees increased by $23 million, or 3.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in third-party expenses related to strategic technology investments.

Marketing and business development 

Marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.

Marketing and business development costs increased by $38 million, or 8.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to strategic investments in our sales platforms.

Information processing 

Information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.

Information processing costs increased by $58 million, or 11.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to higher software licensing costs and other technology investments, as well as an increase in association fees resulting from higher purchase volume in 2021. 

41

Other 

Other primarily consists of postage, operational losses, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities' costs and telephone charges. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. Fraud, or operational losses, are driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.

The “other” component decreased by $332 million, or 34.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower operational losses and a reduction in corporate overhead expenses.

Provision for Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021, increased compared to the prior year primarily due to significantly lower pre-tax income in the prior year, which led to a larger impact related to discrete tax benefits. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes. 

Platform Analysis

As discussed above under “Our Business—Our Sales Platforms,” beginning in June 2021, we now offer our credit products through five sales platforms (Home & Auto, Digital, Diversified & Value, Health & Wellness and Lifestyle), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, for each of our five sales platforms and Corp, Other information.

In December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell $0.5 billion of loan receivables associated with our program agreement with BP. In connection with this agreement, revenue activities for the BP portfolio are no longer managed within our Home & Auto sales platform. All metrics for the BP portfolio previously reported within our Home & Auto sales platform, are now reported within our Corp, Other information in the tables below. We have recast all prior-period metrics for our Home & Auto sales platform and Corp, Other to conform to the current-period presentation.

Home & Auto

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Home & Auto interest and fees on loans decreased by $155 million, or 3.5%, and $102 million, or 2.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily driven by lower loan receivables yield as a result of higher payment rates. 

Other income increased by $9 million, or 15.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by higher interchange fees. Other income increased $17 million, or 39.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by higher debt cancellation fees and lower loyalty costs.

42

Digital

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Digital interest and fees on loans remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2021, as the effect of higher loan receivables was largely offset by the impact of higher payment rates. Digital interest and fees on loans decreased by $109 million, or 2.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by lower yield on loan receivables. 

Other income decreased by $33 million and $39 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily driven by higher program loyalty costs associated with the increases in purchase volume, partially offset by increases in interchange revenue. 

Diversified & Value

Diversified & Value interest and fees on loans decreased by $413 million, or 11.7%, and $562 million, or 13.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily driven by lower average loan receivables. 

Other income decreased by $118 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily driven by higher loyalty costs associated with the increase in purchase volume. Other income increased by $28 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by lower loyalty costs. 

Health & Wellness

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Health & Wellness interest and fees on loans remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2021, as the effect of higher loan receivables was largely offset by the impact of higher payment rates. Health & Wellness interest and fees on loans decreased by $46 million, or 2.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by lower merchant discount as a result of the decline in purchase volume and a reduction in average loan receivables.

43

Other income increased by $52 million and by $29 million, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These increases were primarily driven by commission fees earned by Pets Best.

Lifestyle

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Lifestyle interest and fees on loans increased by $10 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by an increase in average loan receivables reflecting continued strength in power sports and music. Lifestyle interest and fees on loans decreased by $26 million, or 3.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily driven by lower yield on loan receivables. 

Corp, Other

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loan receivables held for sale at December 31, 2021 were comprised of $3.9 billion and $0.5 billion of loan receivables associated with our Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, respectively. 

Corp, Other interest and fees on loans decreased by $153 million, or 12.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by lower average loan receivables. 

Corp, Other interest and fees on loans decreased by $1.9 billion, or 61.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in October 2019.

Other income increased by $163 million, or 89.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily driven by investment gains. Other income remained relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Loan Receivables

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenue. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Loan Receivables, including troubled debt restructurings (“TDR’s”).

The following table sets forth the composition of our loan receivables portfolio by product type at the dates indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Loan receivables decreased 1.4% to $80.7 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the reclassification of loan receivables associated with the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, to loan receivables held for sale. Loan receivables held for sale totaled $4.4 billion at December 31, 2021, and we expect conveyance of both portfolios to occur, subject to customary closing conditions, in the second quarter of 2022. 

Excluding the impact of the reclassification of the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios, loan receivables increased 4% reflecting strong purchase volume growth, largely offset by higher payment rates. Customer payments as a percentage of beginning-of-period loan receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021 were approximately 260 basis points higher than our prior five-year historical average for the year.

Our loan receivables portfolio, excluding held for sale, had the following maturity distribution at December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Credit card loans have minimum payment requirements but no stated maturity and therefore are included in the due within one year category. However, many of our credit card holders will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances at December 31, 2021.

(2)Credit card and commercial loans due after one year relate to TDR assets.

(3)Reflects scheduled repayments up to the final contractual maturity of our installment loans.

45

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Delinquencies

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased to 2.62% at December 31, 2021, as compared to 3.07% at December 31, 2020. The 45 basis point decrease in 2021 was primarily driven by an improvement in customer payment behavior, partially offset by the effects of the reclassification of loan receivables associated with the Gap Inc. and BP portfolios to loan receivables held for sale. When excluding amounts related to held for sale portfolios from both periods, the decrease compared to the prior year was approximately 60 basis points. 

Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The table below sets forth net charge-offs and the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, (“net charge-off rate”) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Allowance for Credit Losses

The allowance for credit losses totaled $8.7 billion at December 31, 2021, compared to $10.3 billion at December 31, 2020, and reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position. Similarly, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables decreased to 10.76% at December 31, 2021, from 12.54% at December 31, 2020. 

The decreases in the allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio are primarily driven by improvements in customer payment behavior, which resulted in a reduction to our estimate of expected credit losses.

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.

Funding Sources

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior unsecured notes. 

The following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Excludes $349 million, $306 million and $280 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

Deposits

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers (“direct deposits”) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers (“brokered deposits”). At December 31, 2021, we had $50.1 billion in direct deposits and $12.2 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to utilize our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.

Our direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. 

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 11 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at December 31, 2021, had a weighted average remaining life of 2.0 years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

47

The following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years. At December 31, 2021, the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing time deposits was 1.1 years. See Note 7. Deposits to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the maturities of our time deposits.

The following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Includes brokered certificates of deposit for which underlying individual deposit balances are assumed to be less than $250,000.

(2)The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. Deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit presented above include partially uninsured accounts.

Securitized Financings

We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (“SYNIT”) through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”). 

At December 31, 2021, we had $4.1 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $3.2 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each case held by unrelated third parties.

48

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNCT notes and SYNIT notes that we owned at December 31, 2021.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT. 

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Represents the excess spread (generally calculated as interest income collected from the applicable pool of loan receivables less applicable net charge-offs, interest expense and servicing costs, divided by the aggregate principal amount of loan receivables in the applicable pool) for SFT or, in the case of SYNCT, a range of the excess spreads relating to the particular series issued within such trust or, in the case of SYNIT, the excess spread relating to the one outstanding series issued within such trust, in all cases omitting any series that have not been outstanding for at least three full monthly periods and calculated in accordance with the applicable trust or series documentation, for the three securitization monthly periods ended December 31, 2021.

Senior Unsecured Notes

During the year ended December 31, 2021 we made repayments of $1.5 billion.

The following table provides a summary of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2021, which includes $750 million of senior unsecured notes issued during the year ended December 31, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Weighted average interest rate of all senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2021 was 3.88%. 

(2)The amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs. 

Short-Term Borrowings

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.

Other 

At December 31, 2021, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

Covenants

The indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) Synchrony’s ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.

If we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2021.

At December 31, 2021, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

50

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Liquidity

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at December 31, 2021 had $13.0 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $18.3 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2020. The decrease in liquid assets was primarily due to the increase in loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, share repurchase activity, and the reduction in funding liabilities. We believe our liquidity position at December 31, 2021 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions related to COVID-19 and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change.

As additional sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $2.2 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.

51

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends, see “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.”
