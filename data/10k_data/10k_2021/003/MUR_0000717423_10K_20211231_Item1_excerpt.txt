Summary

Murphy Oil Corporation is a global oil and natural gas exploration and production company, with both Onshore and Offshore operations and properties. As used in this report, the terms Murphy, Murphy Oil, we, our, its and Company may refer to Murphy Oil Corporation or any one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries.

The Company was originally incorporated in Louisiana in 1950 as Murphy Corporation. It was reincorporated in Delaware in 1964, at which time it adopted the name Murphy Oil Corporation, and was reorganized in 1983 to operate primarily as a holding company of its various businesses. In 2013, the U.S. downstream business was separated from Murphy Oil Corporation’s oil and natural gas exploration and production business. For reporting purposes, Murphy’s exploration and production activities are subdivided into three geographic segments, including the United States, Canada, and all other countries. Additionally, Corporate activities include interest income, interest expense, foreign exchange effects, corporate risk management activities and administrative costs not allocated to the exploration and production segments. The Company’s corporate headquarters are located in Houston, Texas following relocation from El Dorado, Arkansas in 2020. 

As part of the Company’s underlying operations, the Company is continually monitoring its greenhouse gas emissions and impact on the environment as well as other social and environmental aspects of its business. See Sustainability on page 10.

In addition to the following information about each business activity, data about Murphy’s operations, properties and business segments, including revenues by class of products and financial information by geographic area, are provided on pages 31 through 48, 81 through 82, 110 through 125 and 128 of this Form 10-K report.

Exploration and Production

The Company produces crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids primarily in the U.S. and Canada and explores for crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids in targeted areas worldwide. The Company’s management team, based in Houston, Texas, directs these activities. 

During 2021, Murphy’s principal exploration and production activities were conducted in the United States by wholly-owned Murphy Exploration & Production Company – USA (Murphy Expro USA) and its subsidiaries, in Canada by wholly-owned Murphy Oil Company Ltd. (MOCL) and its subsidiaries, and in Australia, Brazil, Brunei, Mexico and Vietnam by wholly-owned Murphy Exploration & Production Company – International (Murphy Expro International) and its subsidiaries. Murphy’s operations and production in 2021 were in the United States, Canada and Brunei. Murphy is in the process of winding down operations in Australia.

Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the Company’s offshore U.S. and total oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production and sales volumes, and proved reserves include a noncontrolling interest in MP Gulf of Mexico, LLC (MP GOM; see further details below).

Murphy’s worldwide 2021 production on a barrel of oil equivalent basis (six thousand cubic feet of natural gas equals one barrel of oil) was 167,356 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a decrease of 4.2% compared to 2020.

For further details on business execution, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” starting on page 32. For further details on 2021 production and sales volume see pages 41 to 42.

United States 

In the United States, Murphy has production of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas primarily from fields in the Gulf of Mexico and in the Eagle Ford Shale area of South Texas. The Company produced approximately 95,600 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids per day and approximately 90 MMCF of natural gas per day in

the U.S. in 2021. These amounts represented 90.1% of the Company’s total worldwide oil and natural gas liquids and 24.4% of worldwide natural gas production volumes.

Offshore

During 2021, approximately 68% of total U.S. hydrocarbon production was produced at fields in the Gulf of Mexico, of which approximately 74% was derived from six fields, including Cascade/Chinook, Dalmatian, Kodiak, Marmalard, Neidermeyer, and St. Malo. Total average daily production in the Gulf of Mexico in 2021 was 64,900 barrels of crude oil and natural gas liquids and 61 MMCF of natural gas. At December 31, 2021, Murphy had total proved reserves for Gulf of Mexico fields of 152.3 million barrels of oil and natural gas liquids and 121.0 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

The Company has various operated and non-operated fields in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The most significant fields are St. Malo, Khaleesi, Mormont, Samurai, Dalmatian and Lucius. Khaleesi, Mormont and Samurai are currently in the development phase.

Onshore

The Company holds rights to approximately 133 thousand gross acres in South Texas in the Eagle Ford Shale unconventional oil and natural gas play. During 2021, approximately 32% of total U.S. hydrocarbon production was produced in the Eagle Ford Shale. Total 2021 production in the Eagle Ford Shale area was 30,670 barrels of oil and liquids per day and 28 MMCF per day of natural gas. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s proved reserves for the U.S. Onshore business totaled 137.8 million barrels of liquids and 199.3 billion cubic feet of natural gas. 

Canada 

In Canada, the Company holds working interests in the following: (a) a dry natural gas area at Tupper Montney (100% owned), (b) Kaybob Duvernay (operated), (c) liquids Placid Montney (non-operated), and (d) two non-operated offshore assets – the Hibernia and Terra Nova fields offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d’Arc Basin.

Onshore

Murphy has approximately 142 thousand gross acres of Tupper Montney mineral rights located in northeast British Columbia. Daily production in 2021 in onshore Canada averaged 6,400 barrels of liquids and 278 MMCF of natural gas. Total onshore Canada proved liquids and natural gas reserves at December 31, 2021, were approximately 14.2 million barrels and 2.0 trillion cubic feet, respectively. 

The Company currently has a commitment for 483 MMCFD of natural gas processing capacity to support production in the Tupper Montney through November 2040. 

The Company holds a 70% operated working interest in Kaybob Duvernay lands and a 30% non-operated working interest in liquids rich Placid Montney lands, both in Alberta. The Company has approximately 310 thousand gross acres of Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney mineral rights.

Offshore

Murphy has a 6.5% working interest in Hibernia Main, a 4.3% working interest in Hibernia South Extension, and an 18% working interest at Terra Nova. 

Oil production in 2021 was 3,765 barrels of oil per day for Hibernia.

During 2021, Terra Nova did not operate as asset integrity work to extend the project was being undertaken. The operator initially provided notice of abandonment in the first quarter of 2021, before a commercial resolution in the third quarter of 2021 led Murphy to acquire an additional 7.525% of working interest in a commercial settlement with the other partners. The Terra Nova asset life is now extended to an estimated date of 2032. 

Total proved reserves for offshore Canada at December 31, 2021 were approximately 25 million barrels of liquids and 14.4 billion cubic feet of natural gas.

Australia

In Australia, the Company holds one offshore exploration permit; Murphy is not the operator. The permit does not have a drilling commitment. 

Brazil

The Company holds an interest in nine blocks in the offshore regions of the Sergipe-Alagoas Basin (SEAL) in Brazil (SEAL-M-351, SEAL-M-428, SEAL-M-430, SEAL-M-501, SEAL-M-503, SEAM-M-505, SEAL-M-573, SEAL-M-575 and SEAL-M-637). ExxonMobil is the operator of the blocks. Murphy has a 20% working interest, ExxonMobil has a 50% working interest and Enauta Energia SA holds a 30% working interest. 

Murphy has also farmed into 3 additional blocks in the Potiguar Basin (POT-M-857, POT-M-863, and POT-M-865) with a 30% working interest; Wintershall Dea is the operator. Subsequent to year end, Wintershall Dea announced that it will terminate all operations in Brazil and will close the office in Rio de Janeiro. Murphy will transition to operator.

Murphy’s total acreage position in Brazil as of December 31, 2021 is approximately 2,453 thousand gross acres, offsetting several major discoveries. There are no well commitments.

Brunei

The Company has a working interest of 8.051% in Block CA-1 and a 30% working interest in Block CA-2; as of December 31, 2021, Block CA-2 is held for sale. 

In CA-1, on November 23, 2017, the governments of Brunei and Malaysia signed a Unitization Framework Agreement (UFA) which resulted in the Jagus East discovery in Block CA-1 forming part of a unitized field with the Gumusut-Kakap (GK) Unit in Malaysia. Following the UFA, on July 4, 2018, a Participation Agreement was signed which finalized the Company’s interest in the Brunei section of the GK Unit.

In CA-2, in December 2014, the governmental authority approved the Gas Holding Area (GHA) for the Kelidang Cluster (KC) development. The consortium is presently carrying out pre-development engineering related to the KC development with the aim to achieve project sanction in 2023.

The CA-1 and CA-2 blocks cover 1.4 million and 157,602 gross acres, respectively. Five exploration wells have been drilled in Block CA-1 and seven exploration wells have been drilled in Block CA-2 as of the end of 2021. 

Mexico 

In March 2017, as part of Mexico’s fourth phase, round one deepwater auction, Murphy was awarded Block 5. Murphy is the operator of the block with a 40% working interest. Block 5 is located in the deepwater Salinas Basin covering approximately 640 thousand gross acres (2,600 square kilometers), with water depths ranging from 2,300 to 3,500 feet (700 to 1,100 meters). The initial exploration period for the license is four years and includes a commitment to drill one exploration well which was drilled in 2019. A further exploration well is planned for 2022.

Vietnam

The Company holds a 65% working interest in Blocks 144 and 145; and a 40% interest in Block 15-1/05 and Block 15-2/17. The Company is operator of each of the three Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs).

Block 15-1/05 contains the Lac Da Vang (LDV) discovered field and the consortium is progressing pre-development engineering. Declaration of Commerciality was made in January 2019 and the field Outline Development Plan was approved in August 2019. The Lac Da Trang (LDT) 1X exploration well, the last remaining commitment of the PSC, was completed in April 2019. The sanction of the LDV development is under review with PetroVietnam.

In Block 15-2/17, the Company is progressing study activity in anticipation of drilling an exploration commitment well by 2023.

In Blocks 144 and 145, the Company acquired 2D seismic for these blocks in 2013 and undertook seabed surveys in 2015 and 2016. The remaining commitment for the acquisition, processing and interpretation of six hundred square kilometers of 3D seismic is tentatively scheduled for 2024. 

Proved Reserves

Total proved reserves for crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas as of December 31, 2021 are presented in the following table. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Includes proved developed reserves of 16.2 MMBOE, consisting of 14.6 MMBBL oil, 0.6 MMBBL NGLs, and 5.4 BCF natural gas, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.

2 Includes proved undeveloped reserves of 2.2 MMBOE, consisting of 2.0 MMBBL oil, 0.1 MMBBL NGLs, and 0.7 BCF natural gas, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.

3 Includes proved reserves of 18.4 MMBOE, consisting of 16.6 MMBBL oil, 0.7 MMBBL NGLs, and 6.1 BCF natural gas, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.

4 Includes proved natural gas reserves to be consumed in operations as fuel of 78.7 BCF and 74.0 BCF for the U.S. and Canada, respectively, with 1.7 BCF attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.

Proved Reserves (Contd.)

Murphy Oil’s 2021 total proved reserves and proved undeveloped reserves are reconciled from 2020 as presented in the table below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 For purposes of these computations, natural gas sales volumes are converted to equivalent barrels of oil using a ratio of six MCF of natural gas to one barrel of oil.

2 Includes 18.4 MMBOE and 2.2 MMBOE for total proved and proved undeveloped reserves, respectively, attributable to the noncontrolling interest in MP GOM.

3 Totals within the tables may not add as a result of rounding.

During 2021, Murphy’s total proved reserves increased by 2.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE). The increase in reserves principally relates to extensions of 90.7 MMBOE in Canada Onshore, 10.3 MMBOE in the Eagle Ford Shale, and 8.4 MMBOE in offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico and East Canada as well as an acquisition of increased working interest in Canada Offshore, offset by negative price revisions in Tupper Montney from accelerated royalty incentive payouts due to higher commodity prices and 2021 production of 61.1 MMBOE.

Murphy’s total proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2021 decreased 6.4 MMBOE from a year earlier. The proved undeveloped reserves reported in the table as extensions and discoveries during 2021 were predominantly attributable to three areas: the onshore Canada area of Tupper Montney, the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Each of these areas had active development work ongoing during the year. The majority of proved undeveloped reserves associated with revisions of previous estimates was the result of negative price revisions in Tupper Montney from accelerated royalty incentive payouts due to higher commodity prices. The majority of the proved undeveloped reserves migration to the proved developed category are attributable to drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale, Gulf of Mexico and Tupper Montney.

The Company spent approximately $473 million in 2021 to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves. The Company expects to spend approximately $700 million in 2022, $371 million in 2023 and $295 million in 2024 to move currently undeveloped proved reserves to the developed category. The anticipated level of spending in 2022 primarily includes drilling and development in the Gulf of Mexico, Eagle Ford Shale and Tupper Montney areas.

At December 31, 2021, proved reserves are included for several development projects, including oil developments at the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas, deepwater Gulf of Mexico; and Kaybob Duvernay in onshore Canada; as well as natural gas developments at Tupper Montney in onshore Canada. Total proved undeveloped reserves associated with various development projects at December 31, 2021 were approximately 297.7 MMBOE, which represent 42% of the Company’s total proved reserves.

Certain development projects have proved undeveloped reserves that will take more than five years to bring to production. The Company currently operates deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico that have two undeveloped locations that exceed this five-year window. Total reserves associated with the two locations amount to approximately 0.4% of the Company’s total proved reserves at year-end 2021. The development of certain reserves extends beyond five years due to limited well slot availability, thus making it necessary to wait for depletion of other wells prior to initiating further development of these locations.

Murphy Oil’s Reserves Processes and Policies

As per the SEC, proved oil and natural gas reserves are “those quantities of oil and natural gas which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward.” The SEC has defined reasonable certainty for proved reserves, as a “high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered.” Proved reserves estimates will generally be revised only as additional geologic or engineering data become available or as economic conditions change. Moreover, estimates of proved reserves may be revised as a result of future operations, effects of regulation by governmental agencies or geopolitical or economic risks. Therefore, the proved reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as being exact quantities, and if recovered, could be more or less than the estimated amounts.

Murphy has established both internal and external controls for estimating proved reserves that follow the guidelines set forth by the SEC for oil and natural gas reporting. Certain qualified technical personnel of Murphy from the various exploration and production business units are responsible for the preparation of proved reserve estimates, and these technical representatives provide the necessary information and maintain the data as well as the documentation for all properties.

Proved reserves are then consolidated and reported through the Corporate Reserves group. Murphy’s General Manager of Corporate Reserves (Reserves Manager) leads the Corporate Reserves group that also includes Corporate reserve engineers and support staff in which all are independent of the Company’s oil and natural gas operational management and technical personnel. The Reserves Manager joined Murphy in 2018 and has more than 20 years of industry experience. He has a Bachelor of Science and a Master of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering as well as a Master of Business Administration. The Reserves Manager is also a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. The Reserves Manager reports to the Chief Financial Officer and makes annual presentations to the Board of Directors about the Company’s reserves. The Reserves Manager and the Corporate reserve engineers review and discuss reserves estimates directly with the Company’s technical staff in order to make every effort to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of the SEC. The Reserves Manager coordinates and oversees the third-party audits which are performed annually and under Company policy generally target coverage of at least one-third of the barrel oil-equivalent volume of the Company’s proved reserves.

The estimated proved reserves reported in this Form 10-K are prepared by Murphy’s employees. Internal audits may also be performed by the Reserves Manager and qualified engineering staff from areas of the Company other than the area being audited by third parties. In 2021, 93.2% of the Proved reserves were audited by third-party auditors and they were found to be within the acceptable 10% tolerance by each of the third-party firms. Murphy engaged both Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (Ryder Scott) and McDaniel & Associates Consultants Ltd. (McDaniel) to perform a reserves audit of 47.9% and 45.3% of the Company’s total proved reserves, respectively.

Each significant exploration and production business unit also maintains one or more Qualified Reserve Estimators (QRE) on staff. The QRE is responsible for estimating and evaluating reserves and other reserves information for his or her assigned area. The QRE may personally make the estimates and evaluations of reserves or may supervise and approve the estimation and evaluation thereof by others. A QRE is professionally qualified to perform these reserves estimates as a result of having sufficient educational background, professional training, and professional experience to enable him or her to exercise prudent professional judgment. Larger business units of the Company also employ a Regional Reserves Coordinator (RRC) who supervises the local QREs. The RRC is usually a senior QRE who has the primary responsibility for coordinating and submitting reserves information to senior management.

QRE qualification requires a minimum of five years of practical experience in petroleum engineering or petroleum production geology, with at least three years of such experience being in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, and either a bachelors or advanced degree in petroleum engineering, geology or other discipline of engineering or physical science from a college or university of recognized stature, or the equivalent thereof from an appropriate government authority or professional organization. Murphy provides annual training to all company reserves estimators to ensure SEC requirements associated with reserves estimation and Form 10-K reporting are fulfilled. The training includes materials provided to each participant that outlines the latest guidance from the SEC as well as best practices for many engineering and geologic matters related to reserves estimation.

Murphy Oil’s Reserves Processes and Policies (Contd.)

The Company’s QREs maintain files containing pertinent data regarding each significant reservoir. Each file includes sufficient data to support the calculations or analogies used to develop the values. Examples of data included in the file, as appropriate, include: production histories; pertinent drilling and workover histories; bottom hole pressure data; volumetric, material balance, analogy, or other pertinent reserve estimation data; production performance curves; narrative descriptions of the methods and logic used to determine reserves values; maps and logs; and a signed copy of the documentation stating that, in their opinion, the reserves have been calculated, reviewed, documented, and reported in compliance with SEC regulations. When reserves calculations are completed by technical personnel with the support of the QREs and appropriately reviewed by RRCs, the Corporate reserves engineers and the Reserves Manager, the conclusions are reviewed and approved with the heads of the Company’s exploration and production business units and other senior management on an annual basis. The Company’s Controller’s department is responsible for preparing and filing reserves schedules within the Form 10-K report.

To ensure accuracy and security of reported reserves, the proved reserves estimates are coordinated in industry-standard software with access controls for approved users. In addition, Murphy complies with internal controls concerning the various business processes related to reserves.

More information regarding Murphy’s estimated quantities of proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas for the last three years are presented by geographic area on pages 112 through 119 of this Form 10-K report. Also, Murphy currently has no oil and natural gas reserves from non-traditional sources. Murphy has not filed and is not required to file any estimates of its total proved oil or natural gas reserves on a recurring basis with any federal or foreign governmental regulatory authority or agency other than the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Annually, Murphy reports gross reserves of properties operated in the United States to the U.S. Department of Energy; such reserves are derived from the same data from which estimated proved reserves of such properties are determined.

Crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids production and sales, and natural gas sales by geographic area with weighted average sales prices for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021 are shown on pages 41 through 43 of this Form 10-K report.

Production expenses for the last three years in U.S. dollars per equivalent barrel are discussed beginning on page 38 of this Form 10-K report.

Sustainability 

Environment and Climate Change

We understand that our industry, and the use of our products, create emissions – which raise climate change concerns. At the same time, access to affordable, reliable energy is essential to improving the world’s quality of life and the functioning of the global economy. We believe that as the energy economy transitions, oil and natural gas will continue to play a vital role in the long-term energy mix.

We are committed to reducing our GHG emissions, and focused on understanding and mitigating our climate change risks. To guide our climate change strategy, Murphy has adopted a climate change position, and we are setting meaningful emissions goals. In 2021, we endorsed the goal of eliminating routine flaring by 2030, under the current World Bank definition of routine flaring. This adds to the Company’s previously established greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity reduction target of 15% to 20% by 2030 from our 2019 level, excluding our discontinued and divested Malaysia operations. 

Murphy recognizes that emissions are only one element of our total environmental footprint. Protecting natural resources is also an important factor in our overall sustainability efforts. See our discussion of Climate Change and Emissions on page 48.

Further, we are subject to various international, foreign, national, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including related to the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials; the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including GHG emissions; wildlife, habitat and water protection; the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment; and the health and safety of our employees, contractors and communities where our operations are located.

U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA). CERCLA and similar state statutes impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of the conduct, on current and past owners or operators of a site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Although CERCLA generally exempts “petroleum” from regulation, in the course of our operations, we may and could generate wastes that may fall within CERCLA’s definition of hazardous substances and may have disposed of these wastes at disposal sites owned and operated by others.

Water discharges. The U.S. Clean Water Act (CWA) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into regulated waters. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act (OPA) imposes certain duties and liabilities on the owner or operator of a facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source or that poses the substantial threat of an oil discharge, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging offshore facility is located. OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. The OPA also requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill.

U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) and the U.S. Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) requirements. BOEM and BSEE have regulations applicable to lessees in federal waters that impose various safety, permitting and certification requirements applicable to exploration, development and production activities in the Gulf of Mexico, and also require lessees to have substantial U.S. assets and net worth or post bonds or other acceptable financial assurance that the regulatory obligations will be met.

These include, in the Gulf of Mexico, well design, well control, casing, cementing, real-time monitoring, and subsea containment, among other items. Under applicable requirements, BOEM evaluates the financial strength and reliability of lessees and operators active on the Outer Continental Shelf, including the Gulf of Mexico. If the BOEM determines that a company does not have the financial ability to meet its decommissioning and other obligations, that company will be required to post additional financial security as assurance.

Air emissions and climate change. The U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA) and comparable state laws and regulations govern emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and other authorization requirements. Since 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has been monitoring and regulating GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, from certain sources in the oil and natural gas sector due to their association with climate change. In addition, international climate efforts, including the 2015 “Paris Agreement” and the 2021 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP26), have resulted in commitments from many countries to reduce GHG emissions and have called for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. 

Murphy is currently required to report GHG emissions from its U.S. operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in south Texas and in its Canadian onshore business in British Columbia and Alberta. In British Columbia and Alberta, Murphy is subject to a carbon tax on the purchase or use of many carbon-based fuels. Additionally, starting in 2017, a carbon tax began to be applied to certain operations in Alberta. Any limitation on, or further regulation of, GHG gases, including through a cap and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, or expanded reporting requirements, could restrict the Company’s operations, curtail demand for hydrocarbons generally and/or impose increased costs to operate and maintain facilities, install pollution emission controls and administer and manage emissions trading programs.

Endangered and threatened species. The U.S. Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. If a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and marine mammals under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.

As noted above, Murphy is subject to various laws and regulatory regimes governing similar matters in other jurisdictions in which it operates. More specifically, Murphy’s operations in Canada are subject to and conducted under Canadian laws and regulations that address many of the same environmental, health and safety issues as those in the U.S., including, without limitation, pollution and contamination, air quality and emissions, water discharges, and other health and safety concerns.

Health and Safety

Murphy’s commitment to safety is strong, and so are our actions to protect our workforce and communities. Our employees are our most valuable asset. Murphy strives to achieve incident-free operations through continuous improvement processes managed by the Company’s Health, Safety, Environment (HSE) Management System (HSE-MS), which engages all personnel, contractors and partners associated with Murphy operations and facilities, and provides a consistent method for integrating HSE concepts into our procedures and programs. We work hard to build a culture of safety across our organization, with regular training, exercise drills and key targeted safety initiatives.

Response to COVID-19. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken a proactive approach and adopted strict protocols to protect our employees and their families, contractors and the communities in which we work from the virus. Our response program continues to be led by our Incident Management Team (IMT), under the guidance of our Crisis Management Team (CMT), leveraging the advice and recommendations of infectious disease experts and establishing safety protocols for all workers. We also developed a COVID-19 tracking app, providing executives with real-time information on infection rates and close contacts, in order to make decisions regarding our COVID-19 response.

Safety. The Company is subject to the requirements of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable foreign and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information regarding hazardous materials used or produced in Murphy’s operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. In Canada, the Company is subject to Federal OH&S Legislation, the provincially-administered Occupational Health and Safety Act (Alberta), the Workers Compensation Act (British Columbia), and WHMIS - the Workplace Hazardous Materials Information System.

At Murphy, we believe in providing energy that empowers people, and that is what our 696 employees do every day. As of December 31, 2021, we had 408 office-based employees and 288 field employees, all of whom are guided by our mission, vision, values and behaviors. Together with the Executive Leadership Team, the Vice President of Human Resources and Administration, who reports directly to our CEO, is responsible for developing and executing our human capital management strategy. This includes the attraction, recruitment, development and engagement of talent to deliver on our strategy, the design of employee compensation, health and welfare benefits, and talent programs. We focus on the following factors in order to implement and develop our human capital strategy:

•Employee Compensation Programs

•Employee Performance and Feedback

•Talent Development and Training

•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

•Health and Welfare Benefits

The Board of Directors receives related updates from management on a regular cadence including the review of compensation, benefits, succession and talent development, and diversity, equity and inclusion.

Employee Compensation Programs 

Our purpose, to empower people, includes tying a portion of our employees pay to performance in a variety of ways, including incentive compensation and merit-based bonus programs, while maintaining the best interest of shareholders. We benchmark for market practices, and regularly review our compensation against the market to ensure it remains competitive to attract and retain the best talent. We believe our current practices align our employees’ compensation with the interests of our shareholders, and support our focus on cash flow generation, capital return and environmental stewardship. For further detail on the Company’s compensation framework please see the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the forthcoming Proxy Statement relating to the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 11, 2022.

Employee Performance and Feedback

We are committed to efforts to enhance our employees’ professional growth and development through feedback that utilizes our internal performance management system (Murphy Performance Management - MPM). The purpose of Murphy’s MPM process is to show our commitment to the development of all employees and to better align rewards with Company and individual performance. The goals of the MPM process are the following:

•Drive behavior to align with the Company’s mission, vision, values and behaviors

•Develop employee capabilities through effective feedback and coaching

•Maintain a process that is consistent throughout the organization to measure employee performance and is tied to Company and shareholder interests

All employees’ performance is evaluated at least annually through self-assessments that are reviewed in discussions with supervisors. Employees’ performance is evaluated on various key performance indicators set annually, including behaviors that support our mission, vision, values and an assessment conducted by the employees’ direct supervisor.

Talent Development and Training

Employees are able to participate in continuous training and development, with the goal of equipping them for success and providing increased opportunities for growth at Murphy. Through our digital platform, My Murphy Learning, employees can access self-directed courses, external articles and videos that cover topics such as business, technology and productivity. We also administer mandatory compliance training for our employees through My Murphy Learning, with a 100% completion rate. Further, we strive to empower our leadership, so we sponsor several programs to address career advancement for emerging leaders and executives. Plus, we provide a tuition reimbursement program for those who choose to acquire additional knowledge to increase their effectiveness in their present position or to prepare for career advancement. Murphy holds internal technical ideas forums each year designed to share best practice and technical advances across the Company, including safety and environmental topics.

We encourage employee engagement and solicit feedback through internal surveys and our employee driven Ambassador program to gain insights into workplace experiences. Employees are provided opportunities to raise suggestions and collaborate with leadership to improve programs and increase their alignment with Murphy’s mission, vision, values and behaviors.

To ensure that our human capital investment and development programs are effective, we track voluntary turnover. This data is shared on a regular basis with our Executive Leadership Team, who use it in addition to other pertinent data to develop our human capital strategy. In 2021, our voluntary employee turnover rate was 5.7%.

Health and Welfare Benefits

We believe that doing our part to aid in maintaining the health and welfare of our employees is a critical element in Murphy achieving success. As such, we provide our employees and their families with a comprehensive set of subsidized benefits that are competitive and aligned to Murphy’s mission, vision, values and behaviors. In 2021, we further enhanced our benefit offerings including by implementing a vacation roll over policy, expanding dental coverage and increasing the number of weeks fully paid for short term disability. We also believe that the well-being of our employees is enhanced when they can give back to their local communities or charities either through the company “Impact – Murphy Makes a Difference” program or on their own and receive a company match for donations. 

In addition, we offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) that provides confidential assistance to employees and their immediate family members for mental and physical well-being, as well as legal and financial issues. We also maintain an Ethics Hotline that is available to all our employees to report, anonymously if desired, any matter of concern. Communications to the hotline, which is facilitated by an independent third party, are routed to appropriate functions, Human Resources, Law or Compliance, for investigation and resolution. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We are committed to fostering work environments that value diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&I). This commitment includes providing equal access to and participation in programs and services without regard to race, creed, religion, color, national origin, disability, sex (including pregnancy), sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, age or stereotypes or assumptions based thereon. We also support interest-based groups such as sports, hobbies and charity volunteering. We welcome our employees’ differences, experiences and beliefs, and we are investing in a more productive, engaged, diverse and inclusive workforce. The Board of Directors receives DE&I updates on Demographic Data, Strategic Partnerships, Recruiting Strategies and Programs from management on a regular cadence. 

Throughout 2021, we focused on creating a unified engagement program to build awareness and encourage open and respectful discussions. We launched a video series where employees were invited to record short videos to share their ideas and experiences on what Diversity, Equity and Inclusion means to them. Under the sponsorship of our Vice President, Human Resources and Administration, we encourage employee engagement and continuous feedback on our programs through our employee-level DE&I committee. The committee, which consists of employees at various levels in the organization, promotes a culture of DE&I. In addition, our Board has had at least one woman member for over 30 years, and currently includes three women directors. Our Nominating and Governance Committee is actively focused on issues of DE&I as part of its overall mandate. Also, our Board expanded the focus of the Health, Safety and Environment Committee to include Corporate Responsibility.
