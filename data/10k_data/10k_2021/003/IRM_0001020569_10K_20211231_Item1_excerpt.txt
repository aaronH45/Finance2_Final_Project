BUSINESS STRATEGY

OVERVIEW

Our company has been a market leader in the physical ecosystem supporting information storage and retrieval, as most businesses have relied on paper documents or computer tapes to store their valuable information. Over time, customers are increasing their digital information, with the new information storage ecosystem being a hybrid of physical and digital mediums. We are a different company than the one we have been historically. The strategic journey we are on is driving this change and our focus remains on four pillars outlined below to grow our business.

Continued growth in physical storage through revenue management as well as volume growth achieved in faster growing emerging markets and consumer and adjacent business growth in developed markets

•We are establishing and enhancing leadership positions in higher-growth markets such as central and eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, through both organic expansion and acquisitions in countries where GDP growth is faster and outsourcing information management is at an earlier stage.

•We continue to identify, acquire, incubate and scale complementary businesses and products to support our long-term growth objectives and drive solid returns on invested capital. These opportunities include our digital services, Secure IT Asset Disposition and our Entertainment Services, Fine Arts and Consumer Storage (each as defined below) businesses.

Utilizing our global scale as well as 70 years of customer trust to deliver differentiated data center offerings

•We have made significant progress in scaling our Global Data Center Business through acquisitions and organic growth, with 19 operating data centers across 16 global markets. 

•As of December 31, 2021, approximately 89% of our data center capacity was leased. With total potential capacity of 604 megawatts ("MW") in land and buildings currently owned or operated by us, we are among the largest global data center operators.

Developing and offering new products and services that allow our customers to achieve reliable and secure information management solutions in an increasingly hybrid physical and digital world•Our customers are faced with navigating a more complex regulatory environment, and one in which hybrid physical and digital solutions have become the norm. Our strategy is underpinned by our persistent focus on best-in-class customer experience, as we continue to seek innovative solutions to help our customers progress on their journey from physical storage to a digital ecosystem.

Increased investment in our business and customer-centric solutions•We have established an investment strategy to fuel our growth. The investments are enabled by the success of Project Summit and informed by our established leadership position in the physical storage business, expanding services, and our significant progress in the Global Data Center business. 

PROJECT SUMMIT

In October 2019, we announced our global program ("Project Summit") designed to better position us for future growth and achievement of our strategic objectives. We expanded Project Summit during the first quarter of 2020 to include additional opportunities to streamline our business and operations, as well as accelerated the timing of certain opportunities previously identified. As a result of this initiative, we simplified our global structure, rebalanced resources to focus on higher growth areas, realigned our management structure to create a more dynamic, agile organization, and made investments to enhance the customer experience. All Project Summit activities were completed in 2021, resulting in $375.0 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA benefits of which $165.0 million were delivered in 2020 and $160.0 million were delivered in 2021, with the remainder to come in 2022. Project Summit charges totaled approximately $450.0 million since the program's inception. For further details on Project Summit, see the "Overview" section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COMPETITION

We compete with thousands of storage and information management services providers around the world as well as storage and information management services managed and operated internally by organizations. We believe that competition for records and information customers is based on price, reputation and reliability, quality and security of storage, quality of service and scope and scale of technology. While the majority of our competitors operate in only one market or region, we believe we provide a differentiated global offering that competes effectively in these areas.

We also compete with numerous data center developers, owners and operators, many of whom own properties similar to ours in some of the same metropolitan areas where our facilities are located. We believe that competition for data center customers is based on availability of power, security considerations, location, connectivity and rental rates, and we generally believe we compete effectively in each of these areas. Additionally, we believe our strong brand, global footprint and excellent commercial relationships enable us to compete successfully and provide significant cross-sell opportunities with our existing customer base.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 9,000 employees in the United States and approximately 16,000 employees outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 500 employees were represented by unions in North America and approximately 1,250 employees were represented by unions in Latin America. All union employees are currently under renewed labor agreements or operating under an extension agreement.

BENEFIT PROGRAMS

We provide our employees with benefits that are designed to support their overall physical, financial, emotional and social well-being. These benefits vary by location but may include health and welfare benefits, paid time off, and programs to support financial security. Additionally, employees are able to access emotional well-being resources through global employee assistance programs. Certain unionized employees receive benefits through unions and are not eligible to participate in our benefit programs. In addition to base compensation and other usual benefits, a significant portion of full-time employees participate in some form of incentive-based compensation program that provides payments based on revenues, profits or attainment of specific objectives for the unit in which they work.

DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION 

At Iron Mountain, we believe that an inclusive environment with diverse teams produces more creative solutions, results in better, more innovative products and services and is crucial to our efforts to attract and retain key talent. As one of our five core company values, Promoting Including and Teamwork is a behavior all of our employees are expected to demonstrate every day. We have prioritized diversity, equity and inclusion ("DEI") as part of our corporate-wide strategic goals. Steps we have taken to create and sustain a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment include: hiring a Global Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer with significant DEI experience to lead our cultural transformation, the path to creating an environment of inclusiveness and belonging. We review and revise our systems, policies and processes to assure that our structures facilitate inclusiveness and accountability. We ensure that our recruiting efforts reflect our diversity goals and we launch, expand and support our Employee Resource Groups, who meet and connect on shared characteristics and life experiences that can prove impactful to our business, our customers and our employees. 

COMPANY CULTURE

We recognize that an inspired culture is foundational to how we deliver on our purpose and create sustained growth and value for our shareholders. Iron Mountain's culture is deeply rooted in its enduring values: Act with Integrity, Own Safety and Security, Build Customer Value, Take Ownership and Promote Inclusion and Teamwork. While Iron Mountain is a culture of learning, collaboration, diversity and well-being, we know that culture overall comes down to what it feels like to work at Iron Mountain. This is why we celebrate our employees who consistently demonstrate Iron Mountain's values in measurable ways while inspiring others to do the same. We commit significant resources to sustaining a culture that enables innovation and facilitates trust, engagement, belonging and performance. We regularly survey our employees on a range of topics to measure our effectiveness and to obtain their views. In addition, headcount data and cost analyses offer insights into how and where our employees work. We use all of this information to refine our approach when necessary to drive increased employee engagement and success. 

COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT

We are committed to integrating responsible and sustainable practices throughout our organization to help our operations to have a positive impact on the environment and the communities in which we operate. We aim to give back to the communities where we live and work, and believe that this commitment helps in our efforts to attract and retain employees. We offer philanthropic support to our global community through our Living Legacy Initiative, which is our commitment to help preserve and make accessible cultural and historical information and artifacts. We encourage volunteerism in the communities in which we live and work through our Moving Mountains volunteer program, offering paid time off for employees to help community-based and civic-minded organizations.

INSURANCE

For strategic risk transfer purposes, we maintain a comprehensive insurance program with insurers that we believe to be reputable and that have adequate capitalization in amounts that we believe to be appropriate. Property insurance is purchased on a comprehensive basis, including flood and earthquake (including excess coverage), subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles. Property is insured based upon the replacement cost of real and personal property, including leasehold improvements, business income loss and extra expense. Other types of insurance that we carry, which are also subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits and deductibles, include medical, workers’ compensation, general liability, umbrella, automobile, professional, warehouse legal liability and directors’ and officers’ liability policies.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

We are required to comply with numerous U.S. federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters which may have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.

For example, some of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances, this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental cost and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, we may be liable for environmental compliance and remediation costs to address contamination, if any, located at owned and leased properties as well as damages arising from such contamination, whether or not we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.

6IRON MOUNTAIN 2021 FORM 10-K
 Part I

We transfer a portion of our risk of financial loss due to currently undetected environmental matters by purchasing an environmental impairment liability insurance policy, which covers all owned and leased locations. Coverage is provided for both liability and remediation costs.

In addition, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity, which are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We devote substantial resources, and may in the future have to devote significant additional resources, to facilitate compliance with these laws and regulations, and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations or breaches. Any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations or breaches of, these laws and regulations could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations, the imposition of fines and penalties, liability resulting from litigation, restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, significant costs and expenses and reputational harm.

For more information about laws and regulations that could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Through our approach to Corporate Social Responsibility, we not only see ourselves as having our own responsibility to society, but also in helping our customers with their own environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, and helping them gain value, make improvements and save costs. We are committed to responsible, sustainable growth. To that end, we have publicly adopted 20 goals to address our environmental footprint, corporate philanthropy and volunteerism and DEI practices. As signatories of The Climate Pledge, we are on a path to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2040. We are committed to the safety and well-being of our employees and strive to cultivate a culture of inclusion that values diverse perspectives across our global workforce. Iron Mountain and its employees also make a social impact in the communities in which we operate through charitable giving and volunteerism.

We have been recognized for our commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility. We ranked 93rd on Newsweek’s 2022 list of America’s Most Responsible Companies. We were a top scorer on the Disability Equality Index in 2020 and 2021. We received a 100% on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for each of the years 2018 through 2022. 

We are committed to transparent reporting on sustainability and corporate responsibility efforts in accordance with the guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative. Our corporate responsibility report highlights our progress against key measures of success for our efforts in the community, our environment, and for our people. We are a member of the FTSE4 Good Index, MSCI World ESG Index, MSCI World Climate Change Index and MSCI USA ESG Select Index, each of which include companies that meet globally recognized corporate responsibility standards. A copy of our corporate responsibility report is available on the “About Us” section of our website, www.ironmountain.com, under the heading “Corporate Social Responsibility." We are not including the information contained on or available through our website as part of, or incorporating such information by reference into, this Annual Report. In addition, we continue to work to further align our reporting with the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures to disclose climate-related financial risks and opportunities.
