Item 1. Business

Introduction

We are an international producer and marketer of beer, wine, and spirits with operations in the U.S., Mexico, New Zealand, and Italy with powerful, consumer-connected, high-quality brands like Corona Extra, Modelo Especial, the Robert Mondavi Brand Family, Kim Crawford, Meiomi, The Prisoner Wine Company, and High West. In the U.S., we are one of the top growth contributors at retail among beverage alcohol suppliers. We are the third-largest beer company and continue to strengthen our leadership position as the #1 high-end beer supplier and the #1 share gainer across the U.S. beer market. Within wine and spirits, we are making solid progress in transforming our brand portfolio to shift to a higher-end focused business to deliver net sales growth and margin expansion. The strength of our brands makes us a supplier of choice to many of our consumers and our customers, which include wholesale distributors, retailers, and on-premise locations. We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.

Our mission is to build brands that people love. We place a relentless focus on the consumer in our pursuit to deliver what’s next and create new experiences that elevate human connections. We believe it is a mission that is Worth Reaching For. It is worth our dedication, hard work, and the bold, calculated risks we take to deliver more for our employees, consumers, trade partners, stockholders, and communities in which we live and work. It is what has made us one of the fastest-growing large CPG companies in the U.S. at retail. Our core values guide our pursuits:

People – True strength is achieved when everyone has a voice. That is why we build our culture on a foundation that encourages inclusion and diversity of thought, where everyone feels empowered to bring their true selves and different points of views to drive us forward

Customers – We are relentless to anticipate what consumers want today, tomorrow, and well into the future

Entrepreneurship – As an industry leader, we act with a bold, calculated approach to realize our vision and unlock new growth opportunities

Quality – Our promise is to pursue quality in our process and products by continuously enhancing what we do and how we do it

Integrity – It is about more than achieving goals. How we achieve them is just as important. We act with high moral and ethical standards and always do the right thing, even when it is the hard thing

Headquartered in Victor, New York, we are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.

Strategy

Our overall strategic vision is to consistently deliver industry-leading total stockholder returns over the long-term through a focus on these key pillars:

•continue building strong brands people love with advantaged routes to market;

•build a culture that is consumer-obsessed and leverages robust innovation capabilities to stay on the forefront of consumer trends; and

•deliver on impactful ESG initiatives that we believe are not only good business, but also good for the world.

We will continue to strive for success by ensuring consumer-led decision making drives all aspects of our business; building a diverse talent pipeline with best-in-class people development; investing in data systems, architecture, and infrastructure that enables our business; and exemplifying intentional and proactive balance sheet management. We place focus on positioning our portfolio on higher-margin, higher-growth categories of the beverage alcohol industry to align with consumer-led premiumization trends, which we believe will continue to drive faster growth rates across beer, wine, and spirits. To continue capitalizing on consumer-led premiumization trends, become more competitive, and grow our business, we have employed a strategy dedicated to organic growth and supplemented by targeted investments and acquisitions. We also believe a key component to driving

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

faster growth rates is to invest and strengthen our leadership position within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce channels. As a result of this strategy, we have realized impacts on each segment of our business.

In our beer business, we focus on upholding our leadership position in the high-end of the U.S. beer market through maintenance of leading margins, enhancements to our results of operations and operating cash flow, and exploring new avenues for growth. We are investing in the next increment of capacity additions required to sustain our momentum. We continue to focus on consumer-led innovation by creating new line extensions behind celebrated, trusted brands and package formats that meet emerging needs.

In our wine and spirits business, we continue to focus on higher-end brands, improving margins, and creating operating efficiencies. We continue to refine our portfolio primarily through the acquisition of higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. We recently reorganized this business into two distinct commercial teams, one focused on our fine wine and craft spirits brands and the other focused on our mainstream and premium brands. While each team has its own distinct strategy, both remain aligned to the goal of accelerating performance by growing net sales and expanding margins. In addition, within the DTC and 3-tier eCommerce channels, we aim to have these channels collectively account for 20% of our wine and spirits business over time.

We complement our strategy with our investment in Canopy by expanding our portfolio into adjacent categories. Canopy is a leading cannabis company with operations in countries across the world. This investment is consistent with our long-term strategy to identify, address, and stay ahead of evolving consumer trends and market dynamics. Our relationship with Canopy is designed to help position it to be successful in cannabis production, branding, and intellectual property.

For further information on our strategy, see “Overview” within MD&A.

Investments, acquisitions, and divestitures

In connection with executing our strategy as outlined above, during Fiscal 2022 we completed the following transactions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For further information about our significant Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020 transactions, refer to (i) “Overview” within MD&A and (ii) Notes 2 and 5.

Business segments

We have four reportable segments: (i) Beer, (ii) Wine and Spirits, (iii) Corporate Operations and Other, and (iv) Canopy. The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, resources are allocated, operating performance is evaluated by senior management, and the structure of our internal financial reporting. Our ownership interest in Canopy allows us to exercise significant influence, but not control, and, therefore, we account for our investment in Canopy under the equity method. Amounts included below for the Canopy segment represent 100% of Canopy’s reported results on a two-month lag, prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and converted from Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars. Although we own less than 100% of the outstanding shares of Canopy, 100% of its results are included in the information below and subsequently eliminated to reconcile to our consolidated financial statements.

We report net sales in two reportable segments, as Canopy is eliminated in consolidation, as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Beer segment

We are the #1 brewer and seller of imported beer in the U.S. market. We are also the leader in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market, which includes the imported, craft, and ABA categories. We have the exclusive right to import, market, and sell the following Mexican brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We have nine of the 15 top-selling imported beer brands in the U.S. Modelo Especial is the best-selling imported beer, second best-selling beer overall, and the fastest-growing major imported beer brand in the U.S. Corona Extra is the second largest imported beer and fifth best-selling beer overall in the U.S.

In the past nine years we have increased our production capacity in Mexico by fourfold allowing us the opportunity to further expand our leadership position in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. Since the 2013 acquisition of the imported beer business, we have invested over $5.6 billion in the Mexico Beer Projects, with approximately $800 million during Fiscal 2022. In early Fiscal 2022, we completed part of a planned expansion project at the Obregon Brewery. This project increased our total production capacity to approximately 39 million hectoliters, which contributed to satisfying our medium-term capacity needs. We expect to spend an 

Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K#WORTHREACHINGFOR  I 3

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

additional $5.0 billion to $5.5 billion over Fiscal 2023 through Fiscal 2026, with the majority of spend expected to occur in the first three fiscal years of that timeframe. Expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities continue under our Mexico Beer Projects to support expected future business needs. For further information about our Mexico Beer Projects, refer to (i) “Production” below, (ii) MD&A, and (iii) Note 7.

We are also building on the success of our leading import brand families through our innovation strategy. Our Modelo Chelada brands have become an important growth contributor to our portfolio as the leading chelada in the U.S. beer market. We continued to build on this successful innovation platform in Fiscal 2022 with a new entrant, Modelo Chelada Piña Picante, which was launched in August 2021 and is already a top share gainer among imported brands. To capitalize on the robust growth of the high-end ABA category we launched Corona Refresca in Fiscal 2020 and Corona Hard Seltzer in Fiscal 2021. In Fiscal 2022, we expanded Corona Hard Seltzer into new flavors and restaged our variety packs with consumer-preferred thematic offerings and enhanced flavor profiles. Additionally, we are continuing efforts focused on increasing distribution of products in can, draft, single-serve, and larger package size formats.

In December 2021, we entered into a brand authorization agreement with Coca-Cola in the U.S. to extend its FRESCA® brand into the beverage alcohol category for the anticipated launch of RTD vodka spritz and tequila paloma cocktails in Fiscal 2023. We intend to include the net sales and operating results of these products in our Beer segment.

Wine and Spirits segment

We are a leading, higher-end wine and spirits company in the U.S. market, with a portfolio that includes higher-margin, higher-growth wine and spirits brands. Our wine portfolio is supported by grapes purchased from independent growers, primarily in the U.S. and New Zealand, and vineyard holdings in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. Our wine and spirits are primarily marketed in the U.S. and exported to Canada and other major world markets.

In the U.S., we have nine of the 100 top-selling high-end wine brands, with Meiomi and Kim Crawford achieving the fifth and eighth spots, respectively. Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands and portfolio of brands include:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In Fiscal 2022, our fine wine and craft spirits brands delivered solid growth, driven primarily by The Prisoner Wine Company brands and High West, as well as strong gains in our DTC, 3-tier eCommerce channels, 

Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K#WORTHREACHINGFOR  I 4

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

hospitality, and international businesses. The focus for our mainstream and premium brands is on maintaining market share, while continuing to deliver growth through premium wine brands, such as Meiomi and Kim Crawford, consistent with our consumer-led premiumization strategy.

Over the last few years, we have been increasing our investment in support of on-trend product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth. We have launched several innovations that are creating momentum and driving growth for the business, including varietal line extensions, such as The Prisoner cabernet sauvignon and chardonnay varietals, Woodbridge spirits barrel aged varietals, Meiomi cabernet sauvignon, and SVEDKA and High West pre-mixed cocktails in the RTD space. Additionally, we recently extended some of our well-known brands through betterment lines, such as Kim Crawford Illuminate, and new package formats, such as Woodbridge 3-liter box.

Corporate Operations and Other segment

The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including costs of executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, corporate growth and strategy, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations, and information technology, as well as our investments made through our corporate venture capital function.

Canopy segment

The Canopy Equity Method Investment makes up the Canopy segment.

For further information regarding net sales and operating income (loss) of our business segments and geographic areas see Note 22.

Marketing and distribution

To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity, and increase sales, we employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales, and customer service functions for our Beer and Wine and Spirits segments. These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions, and public relations. Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.

In the U.S., our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, which generally have separate distribution networks for (i) our beer portfolio and (ii) our wine and spirits portfolio. In addition, in states where the government acts as the distributor, we distribute our products through state alcohol beverage control agencies, which set the retail prices of our products. As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state. State governments can also affect prices paid by consumers for our products through the imposition of taxes.

Trademarks and distribution agreements

Trademarks are an important aspect of our business. We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license. We also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products, and products of others. These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.

Within the Beer segment, we have an exclusive sub-license to use trademarks related to our Mexican beer brands in the U.S. This sub-license agreement is perpetual.

Competition

The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive. We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and reputation, and distribution strength. Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence, and wholesaler attention. We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do. Our principal competitors include:

BeerAnheuser-Busch InBev, The Boston Beer Company, Heineken, Mark Anthony, Molson Coors

WineDeutsch Family Wine & Spirits, Duckhorn Portfolio, E. & J. Gallo Winery, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Treasury Wine Estates, Trinchero Family Estates, The Wine Group

SpiritsBacardi USA, Beam Suntory, Brown-Forman, Diageo, Fifth Generation, Pernod Ricard, Sazerac Company

Canopy operates in the recreational and medicinal cannabis markets and, in their largest market, they compete with numerous licensed producers and distributors of cannabis products. In the recreational market, Canopy competes on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition, consistency, and variety of cannabis products whereas these same competitive factors apply in the medicinal market as well as physician familiarity.

Production

As of February 28, 2022, our production capacity at our Mexican breweries was approximately 39 million hectoliters. By the end of Fiscal 2026, we expect to increase our capacity in Mexico to approximately 64 to 69 million hectoliters to support the growth of our Mexican beer brands. This includes the planned construction of the Southeast Mexico Brewery where there is ample water and we will have a skilled workforce to meet our long-term needs, as well as continued expansion, optimization, and/or construction at our current brewery locations in Nava and Obregon. For further information on these expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities, refer to (i) MD&A and (ii) Note 7. We are continuing to work with government officials in Mexico to determine next steps for our suspended Mexicali Brewery construction project.

Our Daleville facility, located in Roanoke, Virginia, supports our craft and specialty business in addition to our domestic innovation initiatives. In Fiscal 2023, we expect to produce FRESCATM Mixed RTD cocktails using real spirits at this facility.

In the U.S., we operate 12 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey, and San Joaquin regions of California. We also operate two wineries in New Zealand and six wineries in Italy. Grapes are crushed in August through November in the U.S. and Italy, and in February through May in New Zealand and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk. The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest and are reduced as sold throughout the year. In Fiscal 2023, we acquired an additional U.S. winery in Oregon. For further information on this acquisition, refer to (i) “Overview” within MD&A and (ii) Note 2.

We currently operate four distilleries in the U.S. for the production of our spirits; two facilities for High West whiskey, one facility for Copper & Kings American brandies, and one facility for Nelson’s Green Brier bourbon and whiskey products. The requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of our spirits are purchased from various suppliers.

Certain of our wines and spirits must be aged for multiple years. Therefore, our inventories of wines and spirits may be larger in relation to sales and total assets than in many other businesses.

Resources and availability of production materials

The principal components in the production of our Mexican and craft beer brands include water; agricultural products, such as yeast and grains; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum, and cardboard.

For our Mexican beer brands, packaging materials are the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.

For Fiscal 2022, the package format mix of our Mexican beer volume sold in the U.S. was as follows:

As part of our efforts to solidify our beer glass sourcing strategy over the long-term, we formed an equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois, one of the leading manufacturers of glass containers in the world. The joint venture owns a state-of-the-art Glass Plant adjacent to our Nava Brewery in Mexico. The Glass Plant currently has five operational glass furnaces which supply nearly 60% of the total annual glass bottle supply for our Mexican beer brands. We also have long-term glass supply agreements with other glass producers.

The Nava and Obregon breweries receive water originating from aquifers. We believe we have adequate access to water to support the breweries’ ongoing requirements, as well as future requirements after the completion of planned expansion, optimization, and/or construction activities. Both breweries employ comprehensive water management practices that focus on water efficiency and wastewater treatment operations to reuse water consumed as part of the production process.

The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials, primarily glass.

Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by grower purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through November in the U.S. and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand. We receive grapes from approximately 150 independent growers located in the U.S. and 55 independent growers in New Zealand and Italy. We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is largely based on then-current market prices.

As of February 28, 2022, we owned or leased approximately 17,800 acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., New Zealand, and Italy. This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production. However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of certain of our higher-end wines. We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.

We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations. However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.

The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits, and bulk spirits, which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market. We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.

We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags, and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products. After grape purchases, glass bottles are the largest component of our cost of product sold. In the U.S., the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers. We have traditionally obtained, and 

Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K#WORTHREACHINGFOR  I 7

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements. Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations. We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.

Government regulations

We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities. Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising, and public relations. We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership, or control.

We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

As part of our brewery expansion efforts and commitment to making a positive impact on the communities where we operate, we plan to continue working with local authorities and community-based organizations on sustainability initiatives that benefit local residents. Critical local projects have been identified through community collaboration and input and guidance from third-party water restoration organizations. For example, to improve water quality in the Nava area, we have partnered with Pronatura Noreste, investing in a 10-year project that we expect will help restore the Bravo Conchos basin in the Serranía del Burro. In Obregon, we have worked with local organizations to construct three dams along the Yaqui Valley canal that help improve water management efficiency, recovering volumes of water that play a vital role in the sustainability of the region. This is in addition to other benefits we provide, including local job creation and fueling economic development. We plan to work with local authorities in areas near the Southeast Mexico Brewery on similar initiatives.

Seasonality

The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category. As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S. Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.

For Fiscal 2021, our beer net sales were higher in the second and third quarters as inventory levels in our distribution channels were replenished following a COVID-19 related production slowdown at our major breweries in Mexico earlier in the year.

ESG

During the course of our history, we have been committed to safeguarding our environment, making a positive difference in our communities, and advocating for responsible consumption of beverage alcohol products. Our ESG strategy is aligned with our business goals and stakeholder interests, reflects our Company values, and more directly addresses pressing societal needs. Specifically, we dedicate our resources towards:

Serving as good stewards of our environment and natural resources – Modeling water stewardship for our industry; and reducing GHG emissions through energy conservation and renewable energy initiatives

Enhancing social equity within our industry and communities – Championing the professional development and advancement of women in beverage alcohol and our communities; and enhancing economic development and prosperity in disadvantaged communities

Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K#WORTHREACHINGFOR  I 8

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

Promoting responsible beverage alcohol consumption – Empowering adults to make responsible choices in their alcohol (substance) consumption by supporting fact-based education, engagement programs, and policies

During Fiscal 2022 we took the following steps to advance our ESG strategy by key area:

Serving as good stewards of our environment and natural resources

•developed a target to restore approximately 1.1 billion gallons of water withdrawals from critical watersheds and improve water accessibility in disadvantaged communities where we operate between the periods Fiscal 2023 to Fiscal 2025

•developed a target to reduce Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions by 15% between the periods Fiscal 2020 to Fiscal 2025

•completed an assessment to identify and prioritize ESG issues that are most important to our wine and spirits business

•donated $200,000 to The Nature Conservancy’s Resilient Watershed Project

Enhancing social equity within our industry and communities

•five of our eight Focus on Female Founder and Focus On Minority Founder participants grew ahead of their respective categories. Our shared sales team helped drive growth between approximately 160% to 420% in key markets for Austin Cocktails, Durham Distillery, La Fête du Rosé, and Catoctin Creek

•our AASCEND BRG and CSR team created the 2022 Martin Luther King Jr./Black History Month Fund allowing employees the opportunity to lend their support by contributing to community organizations that focus on social equity. Employee and company matched donations went to the Equal Justice Initiative, Facing History and Ourselves, and the Southern Poverty Law Center

•our company support of Dress for Success Worldwide, an organization whose mission is to empower women to achieve economic independence, helped more than 1.2 million women worldwide (80,000 in the U.S.) work towards self-sufficiency. Direct dollars to affiliates in our major office locations helped more than 3,500 women work toward job placement and career advancement goals

•made a $1.75 million multi-year commitment to the National Restaurant Association Education Foundation's “Restaurants Advance” campaign in support of rebuilding the industry workforce

Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K#WORTHREACHINGFOR  I 9

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

Human capital resources

As of March 31, 2022, we had approximately 10,000 employees, including approximately 1,200 employees through our equally-owned joint venture with Owens-Illinois. The number of employees may change throughout the year, as we employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons. Approximately 20% of the employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Collective bargaining agreements expiring within one year are minimal. We consider our employee relations generally to be good.

Employee geographic data is as follows:

COVID-19 response

We have an existing Crisis Management Committee that, since January 2020, has been closely monitoring the impact of the virus that causes COVID-19 on our business and our workforce. In March 2020, the WHO recognized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In response, we implemented various measures to reduce the spread of the virus including working from home, restricting visitors to our production locations, splitting our production workforces, reducing the on-site production workforce levels, screening workers before they enter facilities, enforcing social distancing, and encouraging employees to adhere to prevention measures recommended by the CDC and the WHO. To incentivize U.S. employees to receive COVID-19 vaccines, we provided a one-time employee protection bonus to all full-time and part-time U.S. employees who submitted proof of being fully vaccinated or had approved exemptions. In Mexico, COVID-19 vaccines were not as readily available as in the U.S. We created programs to facilitate access through free, voluntary on-site clinics and local vaccination sites for our employees, including those at the Glass Plant, their families, as well as for other local Nava and Obregon businesses. These efforts contributed to achieving an employee vaccination rate of more than 98% at our Nava and Obregon breweries. Additionally, our Chief Medical Officer provides ongoing health-related advice and expertise to our executive officers, Crisis Management Committee, and human resources leadership teams as they make decisions designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce. The preventative measures we have implemented may be modified and/or discontinued as government agencies issue new guidance, including due to fluctuations in COVID-19 case levels.

We value the contributions of our workforce and considered the impacts the pandemic would have on their well-being. For our production workforce, where employees were not able to work due to temporary facility closures or illness, we protected their pay to ensure they had a continued paycheck. For our hospitality employees, we recognized a material portion of their pay comes from customer gratuities and we paid these employees an equivalent value during the necessary time away. Our non-production workforce is able to work remotely using various technology tools. As part of the remote office approach, we provide reimbursement for home office support ensuring our employees have the resources needed to be effective. We have a formal COVID-19 policy and offer various programs to assist our employees, including engaging with third-party wellness providers to host dedicated sessions on mental and physical well-being, and increased flexibility and resources surrounding personal and family commitments.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion

Our DEI strategic priorities are as follows:

Cultivate a best-in-class, diverse, and equitable workforce – one that reflects the universe of consumers that exist and the communities in which we live and serve

Foster a winning inclusive culture – create a more equitable experience for underrepresented groups; harness the benefits of diversity and inclusivity

Enhance social equity – extend our influence to enhance social equity within the beverage alcohol industry and communities in which we live and serve

Constellation Brands, Inc. FY 2022 Form 10-K#WORTHREACHINGFOR  I 10

PART IITEM 1. BUSINESSTable of Contents

We provide opportunities for our employees to advance our DEI strategic priorities through a growing community of BRGs. Our BRGs are supported at the highest level with sponsorships from our executives. See “Information about our Executive Officers” below. Each BRG is tasked with making a business impact on behalf of the represented group and welcomes allies. In Fiscal 2022, approximately 60% of our U.S. salaried employees were members of one or more BRG.

Monitoring human capital metrics is a key component to ensuring we are executing on our strategy and making progress against our DEI objectives and goals. In Fiscal 2022, we revised our Board of Directors’ Human Resource Committee Charter to specially address oversight of employee DEI matters. We measure gender and ethnic representation to understand diversity at various levels across the organization, assess progress over time, and drive continuous improvement. We have established goals to enhance both gender representation and overall ethnic diversity among our U.S. salaried population to 50% and 30%, respectively, by Fiscal 2026. Our self-disclosed, U.S. salaried employee information is as follows:

Additionally, in Fiscal 2022, we launched a DEI growth dashboard for our U.S. salaried employee base, centered around identifying and addressing workforce diversity representation opportunities, utilizing 2020 U.S. Census data as a benchmark. This dashboard is shared with our executives and with certain committees of the Board of Directors on a quarterly basis enabling them to monitor the progress made and to provide guidance on necessary next steps to attain our representation goals. We also assess metrics throughout the human resource lifecycle to identify potential bias and barriers in our processes, including talent acquisition, turnover, engagement scores, or participation in BRG events.

Compensation and benefits

We strive to provide pay, benefits, and services that meet the needs of our employees. There are four components of compensation: (i) base pay, (ii) long-term incentives dependent on a number of factors such as geographic location and management level which can include restricted stock units, stock options, and performance share units, (iii) short-term incentives, and (iv) recognition awards. Base compensation is reviewed on an annual basis ensuring it is competitive in the market and gives employees opportunities to earn more for exceeding expectations. Our total rewards program also offers valuable benefits, tools, and resources designed to help employees stay healthy and well, while achieving security, growth, satisfaction, and success.

Professional development

Building diverse talent pipelines, delivering best-in-class people development, and championing professional advancement are key components of our human capital strategy which is designed to position our business for long-term growth. In Fiscal 2022, we spent approximately $17 million in development and training costs, including the delivery of four leadership development programs and three women’s focused development programs through the University of Constellation Brands, our learning and development center. We are committed to offering programs, resources, and experiences that empower employees to grow their careers and keep reaching for what’s next, both personally and professionally.

Succession planning

We have a comprehensive succession planning process, led by our human resources team and overseen by the Human Resources Committee of our Board.

Employee engagement

We assess employee engagement through targeted pulse surveys, which provide feedback on a variety of topics, such as company direction and strategy, resources, support, work environment preferences, and well-being. During calendar year 2021, we had a response rate of 76% to our survey and an engagement measurement of 86% across our surveyed population.

Safety

Our global EHS policy defines our dedication to providing a safe and healthy working environment and developing a culture where all employees take responsibility for their own safety as well as the safety of others while minimizing our impact on the environment in the communities where we live and work. With a focus on continuous improvement we are developing more robust EHS management systems, strengthening employee awareness and training, and ensuring senior leadership engagement on safety.
