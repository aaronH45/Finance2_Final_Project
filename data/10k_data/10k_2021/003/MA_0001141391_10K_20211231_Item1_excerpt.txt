Overview

Mastercard is a technology company in the global payments industry that connects consumers, financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital partners, businesses and other organizations worldwide, enabling them to use electronic forms of payment instead of cash and checks. We make payments easier and more efficient by providing a wide range of payment solutions and services using our family of well-known and trusted brands, including Mastercard®, Maestro® and Cirrus®. We operate a multi-rail payments network that provides choice and flexibility for consumers and merchants. Through our unique and proprietary core global payments network, we switch (authorize, clear and settle) payment transactions. We have additional payment capabilities that include automated clearing house (“ACH”) transactions (both batch and real-time account-based payments). Using these capabilities, we offer integrated payment products and services and capture new payment flows. Our value-added services include, among others, cyber and intelligence solutions to allow all parties to transact easily and with confidence, as well as other services that provide proprietary insights, drawing on our principled use of consumer and merchant data. Our franchise model sets the standards and ground-rules that balance value and risk across all stakeholders and allows for interoperability among them. Our payment solutions are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem.

Our Strategy

We remain committed to our strategy to grow our core payments network, diversify our customers and geographies and build new capabilities through a combination of organic and inorganic strategic initiatives. We are executing on this strategy through a focus on three key priorities: 

•expand in payments for consumers, businesses and governments

•extend our services to enhance transactions and drive customer value

•embrace new network opportunities to enable open banking, digital identity and other adjacent network capabilities 

Each of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent. 

Our Key Strategic Priorities

Expand in payments.  We continue to focus on expanding upon our core payments network to enable payment flows for consumers, businesses, governments and others, providing them with choice and flexibility to transact across multiple payment rails (including cards, real-time payments and account-to-account) while ensuring that all payments are done safely, securely and seamlessly. We do so by:

•Driving growth in consumer purchases with a focus on accelerating digitization, growing acceptance and pursuing an expanded set of use cases, including through partnerships 

MASTERCARD 2021 FORM 10-K 7

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

•Capturing new payment flows by expanding our multi-rail capabilities and applications to penetrate key flows such as disbursements and remittances (through Mastercard Send™ and Cross-Border Services), business-to-business (“B2B”) (including Mastercard Track Business Payment Service™ (“Track BPS”) and areas beyond payments such as enablement of supply chain financing) and consumer bill payments

•Leaning into new payment innovations such as our planned launch in 2022 of Mastercard Installments, our buy-now-pay-later solution, and developing solutions that support digital currencies and blockchain applications 

Extend our services. Our services drive value for our customers and the broader payments ecosystem. We continue to do that as well as diversify our business, by extending our services, which include cyber and intelligence solutions, insights and analytics, test and learn, consulting, managed services, loyalty, processing and payment gateway solutions for e-commerce merchants. As we drive value, our services help accelerate our top-line financial performance by supporting revenue growth in our core payments network. We extend our services by:

•Enhancing the value of payments by making payments safe, secure, intelligent and seamless 

•Expanding services to new segments and use cases to address the needs of a larger set of customers, including financial institutions, merchants, governments, digital players and others, while expanding our geographic reach 

•Supporting and strengthening new network capabilities, including expanding services associated with digital identities and deploying our expertise in open banking and open data, including with improved analytics

Embrace new network opportunities. We are building and managing new adjacent network capabilities to power commerce, creating new opportunities to develop and embed services. We do so by:

•Applying our open banking solutions to help institutions and individuals exchange data securely and easily, by enabling the reliable access, transmission and management of consumer data (including for opening new accounts, securing loans, increasing credit scores and enabling consumer choice in money movement and personal finance management)

•Enabling digital identity solutions, including device intelligence, document proofing, internet protocol (“IP”) intelligence, biometrics, transaction fraud data, location, identity attributes and payment authorization to make transactions across individual devices and accounts efficient, safe and secure

Each of our priorities supports and builds upon each other and are fundamentally interdependent: 

•Payments provide data and distribution to drive scale and differentiation in services and enable the development and adoption of new network capabilities

•Services improve the security, efficiency and intelligence of payments, improve portfolio performance, differentiate our offerings and strengthen our customer relationships. They also power our open banking and digital identity platforms

•New network opportunities strengthen our digital payments value proposition, including improved authentication with digital identity, and new opportunities to develop and embed services in our expanding product offerings

Powering Our Success

These priorities are supported by six key drivers:

People. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of the talent we hire. We attract and retain top talent from diverse backgrounds and industries. Our people and our winning culture is based on decency, respect and inclusion where people have opportunities to perform purpose-driven work that impacts communities, customers and co-workers on a global scale. The diversity and skill sets of our people underpin everything we do. 

Brand. Our brands and brand identities (including our sonic brand identity) serve as a differentiator for our business, representing our values and enabling us to accelerate growth in new areas. 

Data. We use our data assets, infrastructure and platforms to create a range of products and services for our customers, while incorporating our data principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by Design and Data by Design processes have been developed to ensure we embed privacy, security and data controls in all of our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data. 

Technology. Our technology provides resiliency, scalability and flexibility in how we serve customers. It enables broader reach to scale digital payment services to multiple channels, including mobile devices. Our technology standards, services and governance model help us to serve as the connection that allows financial institutions, financial technology companies (fintechs) and others to interoperate and enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to engage through digital channels.

Our Business

Our Multi-Rail Network and Payment Capabilities 

We enable a wide variety of payment capabilities (including integrated products and value-added service solutions) over our multi-rail network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, governments and others, offering our customers one partner for their payment needs. 

Core Network

Our core network links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use a Mastercard product at tens of millions of acceptance locations worldwide. This network facilitates an efficient, safe and secure means for receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network. We enable transactions for our customers through our core network in more than 150 currencies and in more than 210 countries and territories. 

MASTERCARD 2021 FORM 10-K 9

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Core Network Transactions. Our core network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network and includes the following participants: account holder (a person or entity who holds a card or uses another device enabled for payment), issuer (the account holder’s financial institution), merchant and acquirer (the merchant’s financial institution). 

We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products. In most cases, account holder relationships belong to, and are managed by, our customers. 

The following graphic depicts a typical transaction on our core network, and our role in that transaction:

In a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below) and other applicable fees, and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.

•Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs and benefits that consumers and merchants derive. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed payments and improved experience for the customers. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.

•Additional Four-Party System Fees.  The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate. Issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit. 

Switched Transactions 

•Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and settle the transaction by facilitating the exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.

•Cross-Border and Domestic.  Our core network switches transactions throughout the world when the merchant country and country of issuance are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants 

10 MASTERCARD 2021 FORM 10-K

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the merchant country and the country of issuance are the same (“domestic transactions”). We switch over 60% of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions. 

We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances.

Core Network Architecture.  Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. The network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple value-added services (such as fraud scoring, tokenization services, etc.) to appropriate transactions in real time. This architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class response time.

Additional Payment Capabilities

ACH Batch and Real-Time Account-Based Payments Infrastructure and Applications. We offer ACH batch and real-time account-based payments capabilities, enabling payments for ACH transactions between bank accounts in real-time. These capabilities provide consumers and businesses the ability to make instant (faster) payments while providing enhanced data and messaging capabilities. We build, implement, enhance and operate real-time clearing and settlement infrastructure, payment platforms and direct debit systems for jurisdictions globally. As of December 31, 2021, we either operated or were implementing real-time payments infrastructure in 12 of the top 50 markets as measured by GDP. We also apply our real-time payments capabilities to new payment flows, such as consumer bill payments using our real-time bill pay solutions. 

Account to Account. We enable consumers, businesses, governments and merchants to send and receive money directly from account to account. We apply these capabilities to help these stakeholders with various disbursements and remittances. 

We discuss below under “Our Payment Products and Applications” the ways in which we apply our real-time account-based and account to account payment capabilities to capture new payment flows. 

Security and Franchise

Payments System Security.  We have a multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem. As part of this approach, we have a robust program to protect our network from cyber and information security threats. Our network and platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, providing greater resiliency and best-in-class security protection. Our programs are assessed by third parties and incorporate benchmarking and other data from peer companies and consultants. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, an enterprise resilience program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities. Through the combined efforts of our Security Operations Centers, Fusion Centers and the Mastercard Intelligence Center, we work with experts across the organization (as well as through other sources such as public-private partnerships) to monitor and respond quickly to a range of cyber and physical threats.

As another feature of our multi-layered approach to protect the global payments ecosystem, we work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and payments industry associations to develop and put in place technical standards (such as EMV standards for chips and smart payment cards) for safe and secure transactions and we provide solutions and products that are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments ecosystem. We discuss specific cyber and intelligence solutions that we offer to our customers in “Our Value-Added Services”. 

Our Franchise. We manage an ecosystem of stakeholders that participate in our network and payments platforms. Our franchise creates and sustains a comprehensive series of value exchanges across our ecosystem. We ensure a balanced ecosystem where all participants benefit from the availability, innovation, safety and security of our network. We achieve this through the following key activities: 

•Participant Onboarding. We ensure the capability of new customers to use our network and define the roles and responsibilities for their operations once on the network

•Safety and Security. We establish the core principles, including ensuring consumer protections and integrity, so participants feel confident to transact on the network 

•Operating Standards. We define the operational, technical and financial policies to which network participants are required to adhere

Our Payment Products and Applications 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]Consumer Debit.  We support a range of payment products and solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs can be used to make purchases and to obtain cash in bank branches, at ATMs and, in some cases, at the point of sale. Our branded debit programs consist of Mastercard (including standard, premium and affluent offerings), Maestro (the only PIN-based solution that operates globally) and Cirrus (our primary global cash access solution).

Prepaid.  Prepaid accounts are a type of electronic payment that enables consumers to pay in advance whether or not they previously had a bank account or a credit history. These accounts can be tailored to meet specific program, customer or consumer needs, such as paying bills, sending person-to-person payments or withdrawing cash from an ATM. Our focus ranges from digital accounts (such as fintech and gig economy platforms) to business programs such as employee payroll, health savings accounts and solutions for small business owners. Our prepaid programs also offer opportunities in the private and public sectors to drive financial inclusion of previously unbanked individuals through social security payments, unemployment benefits and salary cards.

We also provide prepaid program management services, primarily outside of the United States, that provide processing and end-to-end services on behalf of issuers or distributor partners such as airlines, foreign exchange bureaus and travel agents.

Commercial Credit and Debit.  We offer commercial credit and debit payment products and solutions that meet the payment needs of large corporations, midsize companies, small businesses and government entities. Our solutions streamline procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses (such as travel and entertainment) and reduce administrative costs. Our point of sale offerings include small business (debit and credit), travel and entertainment, purchasing cards and fleet cards. Our SmartData platform provides expense management and reporting capabilities. Our virtual card offerings, supported by our Mastercard In Control™ platform, generate virtual account numbers which provide businesses with enhanced controls, more security and better data.

Brand

Our family of well-known brands includes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus. We manage and promote our brands and brand identities (including our sonic brand identity) through advertising, promotions and sponsorships, as well as digital, mobile and social media initiatives, in order to increase people’s preference for our brands and usage of our products. We sponsor a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties to align with consumer segments important to us and our customers. Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, preference and overall usage among account holders globally. Our “Priceless®” advertising campaign, which has run in more than 50 languages and in more than 120 countries worldwide, promotes Mastercard usage benefits and acceptance, markets Mastercard payment products and solutions and provides Mastercard with a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe. 

Data

We use our data assets, infrastructure and platforms to create a range of products and services for our customers, including the majority of our value-added services, which help reduce fraud, increase security, provide actionable insights to our customers to assist in their decision making and enable our customers to increase their engagement with consumers. We do all this while incorporating our data principles in how we design, implement and deliver those solutions. Our Privacy by Design and Data by Design processes have been developed to ensure we embed privacy, security and data controls in all of our products and services, keeping a clear focus on protecting customers’ and individuals’ data. We do this in a number of ways: 

•Practicing data minimization. We collect and retain only the data that is needed for a given product or service, and limit the amount and type of personal information shared with third parties

•Being transparent and providing control. We explain how we use personal information and give individuals’ access and control over how their data is used and shared

•Working with trusted partners. We select partners and service providers who share our principled-approach to protecting data

•Addressing data bias. We ensure our use of advanced analytics, including AI and Machine Learning, utilizes diverse data sets to create fair and inclusive solutions that reflect individual, group and societal interests

•Advancing positive social impact. We utilize our data sets to create innovative solutions to societal challenges, promoting inclusive financial, social, climate, health and education growth

Revenue Sources 

We generate revenue primarily from assessing our customers based on GDV on the products that carry our brands, from the fees we charge to our customers for providing transaction processing and from other payment-related products and services. Our net revenues are classified into five categories: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing, other revenues and rebates and incentives (contra-revenue).

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue” in Part II, Item 7 and Note 3, Revenue for more detail about our revenue, GDV, processed transactions and our other payment-related products and services.

Intellectual Property

We own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other technologies, which are important to our business operations. These patents expire at varying times depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Competition

We face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry and compete in all categories of payment, including paper-based payments and all forms of electronic payments. Among electronic payments, we face the following competition:

•General Purpose Payments Networks. We compete worldwide with payments networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others. These competitors tend to offer a range of card-based payment products. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. Globally, financial institutions may issue both Mastercard and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express, China UnionPay and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products. 

•Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point of sale debit networks in various countries. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). Certain jurisdictions have also created domestic card schemes focused mostly on debit. In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.

•Real-time Account-based Payments Systems. We face competition in the real-time account-based payments space from other companies that provide infrastructure, applications and services to support these payment solutions.

•Alternative Payments Systems and New Entrants. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from alternative payments systems and emerging payments providers. Many of these providers, who in many circumstances can also be our partners or customers, have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payments networks or global or local networks. Examples include digital wallet providers (such as Paytm, PayPal, Alipay and Amazon), point of sale financing/buy-now-pay-later providers (such as Klarna), mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services (such as M-PESA) and handset manufacturers. We also compete with merchants and governments.

•National (Government-Backed) Networks. Governments have been increasingly creating regional payments structures, such as the newly established European Payments Initiative (“EPI”). Backed by numerous Eurozone banks and acquirers, EPI is aimed at creating a unified pan-European payments system, offering card, digital wallet and person-to-person (“P2P”) payment solutions for consumers and merchants. EPI is being positioned as an alternative to existing international payment solutions and schemes such as ours. In addition to regional networks, more than 80 national governments are exploring the use of central bank digital currencies (“CBDCs”). 

•Digital Currencies. Stablecoins and floating cryptocurrencies may become more popular as they are increasingly viewed as providing immediacy, 24/7 accessibility, immutability and efficiency. Such currencies are starting to be accepted by person-to-merchant (“P2M”) players (such as Square). These currencies are also introducing into the payments ecosystem an emerging set of providers referred to as crypto natives, who have the ability to disrupt traditional financial markets. The increased prominence of digital currencies could compete with our products and services. 

•Value-Added Service Providers and Adjacent Network Capabilities Players. We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added products and services, including information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, merchants and governments and technology companies that provide cyber and fraud solutions, as well as companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. We also face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our open banking and digital identity solutions. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.

Mastercard plays a valuable role as a trusted intermediary in a complex system, creating value for individual stakeholders and the payments ecosystem overall. Our competitive advantages include our:

•globally recognized and trusted brands

•highly adaptable global acceptance network built over more than 50 years which can reach a variety of parties enabling payments

•global payments network with world-class operating performance

•settlement guarantee backed by our strong credit standing

•expertise in real-time account-based payments and open banking

•development and adoption of innovative products and digital solutions

•safety and security solutions offered on our network, which reduce fraud and increase security for the payments ecosystem

•analytics insights and consulting services that help issuers and merchants optimize their payments and related businesses

•loyalty solutions that enhance the payments value proposition for issuers and merchants 

•ability to serve a broad array of participants in global payments due to our expanded on-soil presence in individual markets and a heightened focus on working with governments

•world class talent and culture, with a focus on inclusion and being a “force for good”  

Collectively, the capabilities that we have created organically, and those that we have obtained through acquisitions, continue to enhance the total proposition we offer our customers. They enable us to partner with many participants in the broader payments ecosystem and provide choice, security and services to improve the value we provide to our customers. 

Government Regulation

General.  Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our integrated products and services are used. We are committed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and implement policies, procedures and programs designed to promote compliance. We coordinate globally while acting locally and leverage our relationships to manage the effects of regulation on us. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples of the regulation to which we are subject.

Payments Oversight and Regulation. Central banks and other regulators in several jurisdictions around the world either have, or are seeking to establish, formal oversight over the payments industry, as well as authority to regulate certain aspects of the payments systems in their countries. Such authority has resulted in regulation of various aspects of our business. In the European Union, Mastercard is subject to systemic importance regulation, which includes various requirements we must meet, including obligations related to governance and risk management. In the U.K., the Bank of England designated Vocalink, our real-time account-based payments network platform, as a “specified service provider”, and Mastercard Europe as a “recognized payment system”, which includes supervisions and examination requirements. In addition, European Union legislation requires us to separate our scheme activities (brand, products, franchise and licensing) from our switching activities and other processing in terms of how we go to market, make decisions and organize our structure. Certain of our subsidiaries are regulated as payments institutions, including as money transmitters. This regulation subjects us to licensing obligations and regulatory supervision, as well as various business conduct and risk management requirements. 

Interchange Fees. Interchange fees that support the function and value of four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation. Examples include statutes in the United States that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities, our settlement with the European Commission resolving its investigation into our interregional interchange fees and the European Union legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For more detail, see “Risk Factors - Other Regulation” in Part I, Item 1A and Note 21 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8.

Preferential or Protective Government Actions.  Some governments have taken action to provide resources, preferential treatment or other protection to selected domestic payments and processing providers, as well as to create their own national providers. For example, governments in some countries mandate switching of domestic payments either entirely in that country or by only domestic companies. In China, we are currently excluded from domestic switching and are seeking market access, which is uncertain and subject to a number of factors, including receiving regulatory approval. We are in active discussions to explore different solutions. Some jurisdictions are currently considering adopting or have adopted “data localization” requirements, which mandate the collection, processing, and/or storage of data within their borders. This is the case, for instance, in India, China, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. Various forms of data localization requirements or data transfer restrictions are also under consideration in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union. 

Anti-Money Laundering, Counter Financing of Terrorism, Economic Sanctions and Anti-Corruption.  We are subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) and counter-financing of terrorism (“CFT”) laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, as well as the various economic sanctions programs, including those imposed and administered by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). We have implemented a comprehensive AML/CFT program, comprised of policies, procedures and internal controls, including the designation of a compliance officer, which is designed to prevent our payments

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

network from being used to facilitate money laundering and other illicit activity and to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks. The economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC restrict financial transactions and other dealings with certain countries and geographies (specifically Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria) and with persons and entities included in OFAC sanctions lists including its list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (the “SDN List”). We take measures to prevent transactions that do not comply with OFAC and other applicable sanctions, including establishing a risk-based compliance program that has policies, procedures and controls designed to prevent us from having unlawful business dealings with prohibited countries, regions, individuals or entities. As part of this program, we obligate issuers and acquirers to comply with their local sanctions obligations and the U.S. sanctions programs, including requiring the screening of account holders and merchants, respectively, against OFAC sanctions lists (including the SDN List). Iran and Syria have been identified by the U.S. State Department as terrorist-sponsoring states, and we have no offices, subsidiaries or affiliated entities located in these countries and do not license entities domiciled there. We are also subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations globally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which, among other things, generally prohibit giving or offering payments or anything of value for the purpose of improperly influencing a business decision or to gain an unfair business advantage. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls to proactively manage corruption risk.

Financial Sector Oversight. We are or may be subject to regulations related to our role in the financial industry and our relationship with our financial institution customers. In addition, we are or may be subject to regulation by a number of agencies charged with oversight of, among other things, consumer protection, financial and banking matters. The regulators have supervisory and independent examination authority as well as enforcement authority that we may be subject to because of the services we provide to financial institutions that issue and acquire our products.

Issuer and Acquirer Practices Legislation and Regulation.  Our issuers and acquirers are subject to numerous regulations and investigations applicable to banks, financial institutions and other licensed entities, impacting us as a consequence. Additionally, regulations such as the revised Payment Services Directive (commonly referred to as “PSD2”) in the EEA require financial institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, enabling them to route transactions away from Mastercard products and provide payment initiation and account information services directly to consumers who use our products. PSD2 also requires a new standard for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions. This may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.

Regulation of Internet, Digital Transactions and High-Risk Merchant Categories. Various jurisdictions have enacted or have proposed regulation related to internet transactions. The legislation applies to payments system participants, including us and our customers, and is implemented through a federal regulation. We may also be impacted by evolving laws surrounding gambling, including fantasy sports, as well as certain legally permissible but high-risk merchant categories, such as alcohol, tobacco, firearms and adult content. 

Privacy, Data and Information Security.  Aspects of our operations or business are subject to increasingly complex privacy and data protection laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere around the world. For example, in the United States, we and our customers are respectively subject to Federal Trade Commission and federal banking agency information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program. In the European Union, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), which requires a comprehensive privacy and data protection program to protect the personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. A number of regulators and policymakers around the globe are using the GDPR as a reference to adopt new or updated privacy and data protection laws, including in the U.S. (California, Virginia and Colorado), Argentina, Brazil, Canada (Quebec), Chile, China, India, Indonesia, Kenya and Saudi Arabia. Due to increasing data collection and data flows, numerous data breaches and security incidents as well as the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, regulations in this area are constantly evolving with regulatory and legislative authorities in numerous parts of the world adopting proposals to regulate data and protect information. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws are often uncertain and in a state of flux, thus requiring constant monitoring for compliance.

Sustainability. Various jurisdictions are increasingly considering or adopting laws and regulations that would impact us pertaining to ESG performance, transparency and reporting. Regulations being considered include mandated corporate reporting on sustainability matters generally (such as the European Union Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) as well as in specific areas such as mandated reporting on climate-related financial disclosures.

Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies also continue to examine a wide variety of issues that could impact us, including evolving laws surrounding marijuana, prepaid payroll cards, virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security and marketing that would impact our customers directly.
