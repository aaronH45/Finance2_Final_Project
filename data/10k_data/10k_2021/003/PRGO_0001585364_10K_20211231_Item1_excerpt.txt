PART I.

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013. We became the successor registrant to Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"). Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo", the "Company", "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries. 

WHO WE ARE

Our vision is to make lives better by bringing Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. We are a leading provider of over-the-counter ("OTC") health and wellness solutions that are designed to enhance individual well-being and empower consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed. We are headquartered in Ireland and sell our products primarily in North America and Europe as well as in other markets around the world.

We endeavor to empower consumers’ self-care decisions, utilizing the Company’s core competencies to fully take advantage of the massive global trend towards self-care. We define self-care as not just treating disease or helping individuals feel better after taking a product, but also maintaining and enhancing their overall health and wellness. Consistent with our vision, in 2019 Perrigo’s management and board of directors launched a three-year strategy to transform the Company into a consumer self-care leader. We completed our transformation to a consumer self-care company in 2021 by reconfiguring the portfolio through the divestiture of our RX business, announcement of the acquisition of Héra SAS (“HRA Pharma”), and removal of significant uncertainty through settlement of a tax exposure. In addition, we continue to invest in growth initiatives to drive future consistent and sustainable results in line with consumer-packaged goods peers. 

Segments

Our reporting and operating segments are as follows: 

•Consumer Self-Care Americas ("CSCA") comprises our consumer self-care business (OTC, infant formula, and Oral care categories, our divested Animal health category, and contract manufacturing) in the U.S., Mexico and Canada. 

•Consumer Self-Care International ("CSCI") comprises our consumer self-care business primarily branded in Europe and Australia, and our store brand business in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe and Asia. Our liquid licensed products business in the United Kingdom was divested on June 19, 2020.

We previously had an RX segment which was comprised of our prescription pharmaceuticals business in the U.S. and other pharmaceuticals and diagnostic businesses in Israel, which have been divested. Following the divestiture, there were no substantial assets or operations left in this segment. The RX segment was reported as Discontinued Operations in 2021, and is presented as such for all periods in this report (refer to Item 8. Note 8). Financial information related to our business segments can be found in Item 8. Note 21. Our segments reflect the way in which our management makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company.

Business Overview

MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS

Sale of Generic RX Pharmaceuticals Business

On March 1, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our RX business to Altaris Capital Partners, LLC ("Altaris"). On July 6, 2021, we completed the sale of the RX business for aggregate consideration of $1.55 billion, subject to customary adjustments for cash, debt, working capital and certain transaction expenses. The consideration includes approximately $53.3 million of reimbursements which Altaris will be required to deliver in cash to Perrigo pursuant to the terms of the Agreement. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain, net of professional fees, of $47.5 million recorded in Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations for discontinued operations. The gain included a $159.3 million increase from the write-off of foreign currency translation adjustment from Accumulated other comprehensive income. The sale of the RX business helped establish Perrigo as a pure-play consumer self-care company, and was an essential milestone in our transformation plan.

HRA Pharma Acquisition Agreement

On September 8, 2021, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary Habsont Unlimited Company (the "Purchaser"), entered into a Put Option Agreement to acquire certain holding companies holding all of the outstanding equity interests of HRA Pharma from funds affiliated with private equity firms Astorg and Goldman Sachs Asset Management (collectively, the "Sellers"). Pursuant to the Put Option Agreement, following completion of the works council consultation process required under French law, the selling shareholders exercised their put option right under the Put Option Agreement and, on October 20, 2021, the Company, the Purchaser and the Sellers entered into a Securities Sale Agreement in the form previously agreed by the parties (the “Purchase Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser has agreed to acquire certain holding companies holding all of the outstanding equity interests of HRA Pharma from the Sellers for cash. The transaction values HRA Pharma at approximately €1.8 billion, or approximately $2.1 billion based on exchange rates as of the date of the Put Option Agreement, on an enterprise value basis and using a lockbox mechanism set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In September 2021, we entered into two non-designated currency option contracts to hedge the foreign currency exposure of the euro-denominated purchase price for HRA Pharma (refer to Item 8. Note 11). 

The proposed final transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. We intend to pay the purchase price using a combination of cash on hand and, depending upon market conditions, either funds available under our current credit facility or funds from new debt financing. HRA Pharma is one of the fastest growing OTC companies globally, with three category-leading self-care brands in blister care (Compeed®), women’s health (ellaOne®) and scar care (Mederma®), and brings expertise in prescription-to-OTC switches. This acquisition is expected to strengthen our presence in Europe, improve our financial profile and margins, and build on our transformation to a consumer self-care company. Operating results are expected to be reported within both our CSCA and CSCI segments. 

Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic

We have been impacted by the coronavirus (COVID-19) global pandemic and the responses by government entities to combat the virus. We currently continue to operate in all our jurisdictions and are complying with the rules and guidelines prescribed in each jurisdiction. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview for a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to our business.

Tribunal Ruling in Claim Arising from the Omega Acquisition

As previously disclosed, we were involved in arbitration in Belgium related to our claims of fraud in connection with the Omega acquisition. The Tribunal panel, as described in more detail under Claim Arising from the Omega Acquisition in Item 8. Note 19, found fraud by the sellers of Omega in a ruling on August 27, 2021 and awarded Perrigo approximately €355.0 million ($417.6 million at the time of cash receipt) including fees and costs. The panel also ruled against the sellers and in favor of Perrigo on all the counterclaims. The sellers have paid all amounts owed under the award, and the arbitral proceedings have now ended. The arbitration proceedings remain confidential as required by the Share Purchase Agreement dated November 6, 2014 ("SPA") and the rules of Belgian Centre for Arbitration and Mediation ("CEPANI"). We recorded the cash receipt as a reduction to Operating Expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Tax Updates

As described in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis – Recent Developments, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Tax Related Risks, and Item 8. Note 17, we are engaged in tax disputes in several jurisdictions. The following update notes certain material developments in such disputes since December 31, 2020, and makes use of certain terms defined in Item 8. Note 17.

•IRS Audit (2013-2015 Tax Years). On January 13, 2021, the IRS issued a 30-day letter proposing, among other modifications, certain transfer pricing adjustments regarding our profits from the distribution of omeprazole during our 2013 to 2015 tax years in the aggregate amount of $141.6 million. We timely filed a protest on February 26, 2021, on the grounds that certain of the government’s positions are currently the subject of pending litigation in the Western District of Michigan with respect to refund requests relating to our 2009 through 2012 tax years. We believe that we should prevail on the merits on the issues being contested. However, we have reserved for taxes and interest payable on a 5.24% deemed royalty on omeprazole, which we have conceded, through the tax year ended December 31, 2018.

In addition, the 30-day letter for the 2013-2015 tax years expanded on a Notice of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPA") issued on December 11, 2019 and proposed to disallow adjustments to gross sales income on the sale of prescription products to wholesalers for accrued wholesale customer pipeline chargebacks where the prescription products were not re-sold by such wholesalers to covered retailers by the end of the tax year for the 2013-2015 tax years. We filed a protest on February 26, 2021 to request IRS Appeals consideration. On January 20, 2022, the IRS responded to our Protest with its Rebuttal and reiterated its position in the NOPA that the accrued chargebacks are not currently deductible in the tax year accrued because all events have not occurred to establish the fact of the liability in the year deducted. If the IRS were to prevail in its proposed adjustment, we estimate a payment of approximately $18.0 million, excluding interest and penalties for the 2013-2015 tax years. In addition, we expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for future years. If those future adjustments were to be sustained, based on preliminary calculations and subject to further analysis, we estimate this would result in a payment not to exceed $7.0 million through tax year ended December 31, 2021, excluding interest and penalties. We have fully reserved for this issue. We strongly disagree with the IRS’s proposed adjustment and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary.

•IRS NOPA (Interest Deductibility for 2014-2015 Tax Years). On January 13, 2021, we received a Revenue Agent Report (“RAR”) for our 2013-2015 tax years, which retains the adjustment from the previously disclosed NOPA dated May 7, 2020, which disallowed interest expense deductions of $414.7 million on $7.5 billion in debts owed by Perrigo U.S. to Perrigo Company plc for the 2014 and 2015 tax years. We timely filed a protest to the RAR with the IRS. The RAR caps the interest rate on the debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes at 130.0% of the Applicable Federal Rate on the stated grounds that the loans were not negotiated on an arm's-length basis. The IRS advised on May 3, 2021, that it changed its policy for all taxpayers and will no longer pursue the default interest of 130.0% of AFR. However, on January 20, 2022, the IRS responded to our Protest, which we filed on February 26, 2021, with its Rebuttal, and revised its position on this interest rate issue by reasserting that implicit parental support considerations are necessary to determine the arm's length interest rate and proposed revised interest rates that are higher than the interest rates proposed under its 130% of AFR assertion. The blended interest rate proposed by the IRS Rebuttal is 4.36%, an increase from the blended interest rate in the RAR of 2.57%, and lower than the stated blended interest rate of the loans of 6.8%. We will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to defend the deductibility of the interest expense on this indebtedness. 

•Irish Revenue NoA. On November 4, 2020, the Irish High Court ruled that the NoA did not violate our constitutional rights and legitimate expectations as a taxpayer. The Irish High Court did not review the technical merits of the NoA under Irish law. Elan Pharma pursued further challenges in the Irish Tax Appeals Commission, which scheduled a hearing for late 2021. Prior to the scheduled hearing, on September 29, 2021, Elan Pharma and Irish Revenue agreed to a full and final settlement of the NoA on the following terms: (i) on a 'without prejudice basis' and, for purposes of the settlement, an alternative basis of taxation was applied, (ii) Irish Revenue to take no further action in relation to the NoA or any Tysabri related income or transactions, (iii) no interest or penalties applied, (iv) a total tax of €297.0 million charged as full and final settlement of all liabilities arising from the sale of the Tysabri patents for the fiscal years 2013 to 2021, and (v) after Irish Revenue credited taxes already paid and certain unused R&D credits against the €297.0 million charged settlement amount, the total cash payment of €266.1 million ($307.5 million) was made on

Business Overview

October 5, 2021. We recorded the payment as a component of income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

•Israeli Notice of Assessment. On December 29, 2020, we received a Stage A assessment from the Israeli Tax Authority ("ITA") for the tax years ended December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2017 in the amount of $63.8 million relating to attribution of intangible income to Israel, income qualifying for a lower preferential rate of tax, exemption from capital gains tax, and deduction of certain settlement payments. We timely filed our protest on March 11, 2021 to move the matter to Stage B of the assessment process. Through negotiations with the ITA, we resolved the audit for the tax year ended June 27, 2015 through tax year ended December 31, 2019, by agreeing to add tax year ended December 31, 2018 and tax year ended December 31, 2019 to the audit to reach an agreeable resolution to provide certainty for these additional periods. The agreement with the ITA required us to pay $19.0 million, after offset of refunds of $17.2 million, for the five taxable years. In addition, we paid $12.5 million to resolve a tax liability indemnity for the tax year ended December 31, 2017 relating to Perrigo API Ltd, which we disposed of in December 2017. We recorded the payments as a component of income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

•IRS NOPA (Athena IPR&D Royalty Rate). Without prejudice to pursuing other administrative and judicial remedies, on April 21 and 23, 2020, we filed requests for Competent Authority Assistance with the IRS and Irish Revenue to alleviate potential double taxation on Tysabri income for the 2011-2013 tax years followed by a supplemental request on October 20, 2020 related to a disputed litigation expense deduction involving the drug Zonegran. Both requests were accepted and are under review by the Competent Authorities of the United States and Ireland.

•IRS Audit (Omeprazole Transfer Pricing Adjustments in 2009-2012 Tax Years). A trial was held during the period May 25, 2021 to June 7, 2021 for the refund case in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. Post-trial briefings were completed on September 24, 2021 and the case is now fully submitted for the court’s decision.

Securities Litigation Settlement 

A settlement was reached in the case, In re Perrigo Company plc Securities Litigation as described in more detail in Item 8. Note 19 under the header In the United States (cases related to Irish Tax events). Motion papers seeking approval of the class action settlement were filed on October 4, 2021. The Court issued a preliminary approval order on October 29, 2021, which led to notices being sent to class members. The Court held a hearing on February 16, 2022 about the settlement and issued the Final Approval Order and Judgment. As a result, the settlement has been approved and the case has now ended. The settlement has been funded by insurance.

Share Repurchases

We did not purchase any shares during the year ended December 31, 2021.

Stock Exchange Listing

On November 22, 2021, we initiated steps to voluntarily delist our ordinary shares from trading on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (“TASE”). The delisting of our ordinary shares took effect on February 23, 2022, three months following the date of our request to the TASE pursuant to Israeli law. Our ordinary shares will continue to be listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), and all ordinary shares that were traded on TASE were transferred to the NYSE where they continue to be traded.

Leadership Changes

Effective October 5, 2021, Jim Dillard was named Executive Vice President ("EVP") and President of our CSCA segment. Mr. Dillard's supply chain, manufacturing, R&D, innovation, and regulatory experience, along with his proven leadership skills, make him qualified to lead this segment. Before this role, Mr. Dillard served as Perrigo's EVP and Chief Scientific Officer.

Business Overview

NEW PRODUCTS

We consider a product to be new if it (i) was reformulated, (ii) was a product line extension due to changes in characteristics such as strength, flavor, or color, (iii) had a change in product status from "prescription only" ("Rx") to OTC, (iv) was a new store brand or branded launch, (v) was provided in a new dosage form or (vi) was sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities, in all cases, within 12 months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured. During the year ended December 31, 2021, new product sales were $130.0 million.

CONSUMER SELF-CARE AMERICAS

Overview

The CSCA segment is focused primarily on the sale of self-care products that help to grow our customers' overall self-care portfolio in categories including Upper respiratory, Pain and sleep-aids, Digestive health, Nutrition, Vitamins, minerals and supplements ("VMS"), Healthy lifestyle, Skincare and personal hygiene, and Oral care in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and South America. We are a leading provider of self-care products sold to consumers via store brands. Consumer awareness and knowledge of the quality, value and efficacy of our products continues to grow due to efforts made by our retailers and wholesalers. We provide our customers self-care products under both their own brands and our brands, which are sold to consumers in store at shelf, store pickup and online. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CSCA segment represented approximately 65% of consolidated net sales. 

The CSCA segment develops, manufactures, and markets store brand self-care products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brands. Store brand products must meet the same stringent U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements as national brands within the U.S. and the requirements of comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S. In most instances, our product packaging is designed to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products, while communicating store brand value to consumers.

The cost of store brand and our branded products to retailers is significantly lower than that of comparable nationally advertised brand name products. Generally, retailers’ dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product. The retailer, therefore, can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater profit margin. The consumer benefits by receiving a high-quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product. As a result, our business model results in consumers saving money on their self-care needs. 

We are dedicated to continuing to be the leader in developing and marketing new store brand and our branded products and have a research and development ("R&D") staff that we believe is one of the most experienced in the industry at developing products comparable in formulation and quality to national brand products. In order to offer consumers product features or benefits that national brand companies do not offer, we have implemented a product development strategy to differentiate store brand and our branded products from national brands. Our R&D team also responds to changes in existing national brand products by reformulating existing products. For example, in the OTC pharmaceutical market, certain new products are the result of changes in product status from Rx-to-OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require FDA approval through a process initiated by the drug innovator. The drug innovator usually begins the process by filing a New Drug Application ("NDA"), which is often followed by a competitor filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"). Global regulatory agencies highly scrutinize any product application submitted to switch a product from physician prescribed Rx to OTC. New drugs are also marketed through the FDA's OTC monograph process, which allows us to produce drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective without pre-marketing approval. In the Oral care category, we focus on creating products that are equivalent to the national brands, and also partner with our customers to create exclusive brands and differentiated products. We rely on both internal R&D and strategic product development agreements with outside sources to develop new products.

The CSCA segment also develops, manufactures, and distributes certain branded products, which are consistent with the segment's self-care strategy. Our branded products sold under brand names include Prevacid®24HR, Good Sense®, Zephrex D®, ScarAway®, Plackers®, Rembrandt®, Steripod®, Firefly®, REACH®, Dr. Fresh® , and Burt's Bees®.

We manufacture a significant portion of our CSCA segment's products at our plants located in the U.S., Mexico, and China, and we source the remaining materials and products from third parties. In addition, in order to 

6

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

CSCA

maximize both our capacity and sales of proprietary formulas, we engage in contract manufacturing, which involves producing unique ANDAs and monograph products through partnerships with major pharmaceutical and direct-to-consumer companies. 

We believe the increasing age of the global population, continued rising healthcare costs, and consumers who proactively prevent or treat conditions will drive the need for the enhanced value that our products provide to consumers, which creates strong dynamics for U.S. OTC market growth. Another level of growth includes share gains against store brand competitors and store brand penetration gains versus national brands. In addition, we believe that new products, including new product innovation and products switching from Rx-to-OTC status (as described above) will continue to drive demand for our products and market growth within the segment.

Recent Trends and Developments

•During the third quarter of 2021, supply chain disruptions, including a significant shortage of truck drivers in the U.S. and record delays at global shipping ports, led to higher unfulfilled customer orders and higher input costs compared to the prior year. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we took a series of actions to improve the situation, including reconfiguring our distribution system for short term shipments, outsourcing highly complex product lines to a third party logistic provider, adding regional carriers for challenged shipping lanes, hiring additional distribution center personnel, and increasing the purchase cycle as it relates to the manufacturing process. While we believe supply chain disruptions will continue in the near-term, we are expecting to continue to see improvements throughout 2022.

•During the first half of 2021, net sales of cough and cold products decreased as a result of the very low incidence of cough and cold related illness, which we believe is attributed to social distancing and mask mandates put in place to combat the spread of COVID-19. However, increased consumer takeaway at our retail customers, starting in May 2021, suggested normalizing consumer purchasing routines could be expected in the second half of 2021. In the third quarter, we experienced higher demand for cough, cold and pain products due primarily to the higher incidences of cough and cold illness as society returned to in-person activities. Consumer take away continued to remain strong during the fourth quarter and, as such, we expect sales of cough, cold and pain products to continue to increase, depending on the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic moving forward (refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview).

•On May 18, 2021, we announced a definitive agreement to sell our Latin American businesses to Advent International. This transaction is part of our margin improvement program and Project Momentum cost savings initiative and is expected to close in the first half of 2022. We determined that the carrying value of these businesses exceeded their fair value less cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $162.2 million allocated to goodwill and assets held for sale (refer to Item 8. Note 9).

Our CSCA segment offers products in the following categories:

Product CategoryDescription

Pain and sleep-aidsProducts comprised of pain relievers, fever reducers and sleep-aids.

Upper respiratoryProducts that relieve upper respiratory symptoms, including cough suppressants, expectorants, sinus and allergy relief.

Digestive healthProducts such as antacids, anti-diarrheal, and anti-heartburn that relieve symptoms associated with digestive issues.

Skincare and personal hygieneProducts for the face and body such as dermatological care, scar management, lice treatment, and other products for various skin conditions.

Oral careProducts used for oral care, including toothbrushes, toothbrush replacement heads, floss, flossers, whitening products and toothbrush covers.

Vitamins, minerals, and supplementsVitamins, minerals, and supplements.

OtherDiagnostic products and other miscellaneous self-care products.

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CSCA segment, which includes net sales from our OTC contract manufacturing business for the year ended December 31, 2021.

We launched several new CSCA products in the year ended December 31, 2021, most notably a store brand hypoallergenic infant formula, Diclofenac sodium topical gel 1%, and Esomeprazole Mini. During the year ended December 31, 2021, new product sales in the CSCA segment were $56.1 million.

We, on our own or in conjunction with partners, received final FDA approval for one new product within the CSCA segment in the year ended December 31, 2021, and as of December 31, 2021, we had eight new product applications pending FDA approval.

CSCA

Sales and Marketing

Our customers include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains such as Walmart, Costco, CVS, Target, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Kroger, Dollar General, Sam’s Club, Topco, Padagis e-commerce stores including Amazon, and major wholesalers, including McKesson, Amerisource Bergen, and Cardinal Health.

We seek to establish customer loyalty through superior customer service by providing a comprehensive assortment of high quality, affordable products; timely processing, shipment and delivery of orders; assistance in managing customer inventories; and support in managing and building the customer’s self-care market portfolio including their store brand business, trade and digital marketing activities. The CSCA segment employs its own sales force to service larger customers and uses industry brokers for other customers. Field sales employees, with support from marketing and customer service team members, are assigned to specific customers in order to work most effectively with the customer. The commercial organization provides our customers with customized in-store and digital marketing programs for all products we supply in the customers' self-care market portfolio.

The primary objective of this management approach is to enable our retail, e-commerce, and wholesale customers to increase sales and market share of their overall self-care portfolio. We partner with our retailers to provide customized store brand and branded products that provide quality and value to consumers. We invite comparison of store brand and our branded products to national brand products. Our sales and marketing personnel assist customers in the development and introduction of new store brand and our branded products, and in the promotion of customers’ existing store brand and our branded products by providing market information; establishing individualized promotions and marketing programs, which may include floor displays, bonus sizes, coupons, rebates, store signs, and promotional packs; and performing consumer research. During the year we saw consumers seeking more of their self-care product needs online, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in the growth of e-commerce as a consumer channel for our products. We have developed resources, programs and tools to be a strategic marketing partner for our customers’ digital marketing efforts. This provides our customers with a holistic campaign to convert shoppers to store brand whether they shop in-store or online.

In contrast to national brand manufacturers, which incur considerable advertising and marketing expenditures targeted directly to the end user or consumer, the CSCA segment’s primary marketing efforts are channeled through retailers and wholesalers and reach the consumer through our customers’ in-store marketing programs and our digital media programs. Because the retail profit margin for store brand and our branded products is generally higher than national brand products, retailers and wholesalers often commit funds for additional promotions.

In addition to in-store marketing programs, team members in our nutrition category market products directly to consumers and healthcare professionals.

Competition

The markets for our self-care products are highly competitive and differ for each product line and geographic region. Our primary competitors include manufacturers, such as Dr. Reddy's Labs, LNK International, Inc., PL Developments, Aurobindo and Sun Pharmaceuticals, and brand-name pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Reckitt Benckiser, Abbott Nutrition, Bayer AG, Sanofi and Philips. The various major categories of our CSCA business each have certain key competitors, such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines. However, some competitors do have larger sales volumes in certain of our categories. Additionally, national brand companies tend to have more resources committed to marketing their products and could in the future manufacture store brand versions of their products at lower prices than their national brand products. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality, assortment of products, customer service, marketing support, and approvals for new products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for additional information and risks associated with competition.

CSCI

CONSUMER SELF-CARE INTERNATIONAL

Overview

The CSCI segment is comprised of our consumer self-care business outside of North America, including our branded business in Europe and Australia and our store brand businesses in the United Kingdom and parts of Europe and Asia. The CSCI segment develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes many well-known European consumer self-care brands in the Upper respiratory, Pain and sleep-aids, Digestive health, VMS, Healthy lifestyle, Skincare and personal hygiene, and Oral care categories. The segment leverages its broad regulatory, sales, and distribution infrastructure to innovate new products and brands, in-license and expand product lines, and sell and distribute third-party brands. The CSCI segment sells these products through an extensive network of customers including pharmacies, wholesalers, drug and grocery store retailers, and para-pharmacies in more than 23 countries, primarily in Europe. Many CSCI products have leading positions in the markets in which they compete. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the CSCI segment represented approximately 35% of consolidated net sales.

Through continued investment in R&D partnerships and new technologies, the CSCI segment strives to offer high quality self-care products that meet consumers' needs. Internal R&D, new product development, insourcing, acquisitions, and partnerships support the new product pipeline, both in terms of brand extensions and product improvements. In the U.K., R&D focuses on the development of both store brand and branded products. Additional R&D centers are located in France, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, China, the Netherlands, and Germany. In the rest of Europe, most R&D is performed by external partners with oversight from our teams. The segment has seven plants dedicated to manufacturing certain of its products.

The CSCI segment primarily focuses on building local and regional brands sold through mass merchandisers, drug stores, individual and chain pharmacies, and e-commerce channels.

While the CSCI segment sells approximately 220 brands, we primarily concentrate our resources on "Focus Brands", consisting of approximately 50 key brands and sub-brands. These are selected on the basis of their current sales and growth potential in the self-care market. Additional resources, including R&D investments, are allocated to these Focus Brands to strengthen their market position in high opportunity profit categories while leveraging the same R&D efforts under smaller local brands.

Recent Trends and Developments

•During the first half of 2021, net sales of cough and cold products decreased as a result of the very low incidence of cough, cold and flu related illness this year. We believe the very low incidence of cough, cold and flu related illness was attributed to COVID-19 social distancing and mask requirements. During the second half of 2021, we experienced higher demand for cough and cold, and pain products due primarily to the higher incidences of cough, cold and flu illness as society returned to in-person activities. The spread of certain COVID-19 variants may have contributed to these higher incidences as their symptoms can be similar. Further, consumer take away remained strong during the second half of 2021 led by cough and cold, and pain products, and we expect further normalizing of consumer purchasing routines moving forward depending on the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview. 

•During the third quarter, a number of EU regulators requested recalls, some at the consumer level, due to the detection of 2-chloroethanol (“2-CE”). 2-CE has been associated with the presence of ethylene oxide, a constituent in pesticides, which is not permitted for use in food products under food regulations in the EU. Due to the potential presence of ethylene oxide in certain of our vitamin, minerals and supplements ("VMS") products, we initiated recalls. We have since secured alternate sourcing of the raw material. During the year ended December 31, 2021, these recalls resulted in a decrease in net sales of $2.6 million and a decrease in gross profit of $5.5 million, which included obsolete inventory.

CSCI

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CSCI segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. 

We launched a number of new CSCI products in the year ended December 31, 2021, most notably some line extensions in the XLS weight management brand and ACO® brands in the Healthy lifestyle and Skincare and personal hygiene categories, respectively. In addition, we launched various VMS line extensions and a pan European probiotic mix under the new brand Probify®. During the year ended December 31, 2021, new product sales in the CSCI segment were $73.9 million.

The CSCI segment has new product development across all categories, with each of its Focus Brands having a three to five-year innovation master plan.

Sales and Marketing 

Our products are sold to customers including pharmacies as well as, drug, grocery, and e-commerce stores located primarily in Europe, such as Walgreens Boots Alliance, McKesson, AS Watson, Tesco, ASDA, DM, Rossman, Carrefour, and Amazon. The CSCI segment continues to align its sales and marketing organization with current market trends by significantly increasing resources towards e-commerce and key account management. The segment sells its products primarily through an established pharmacy sales force to an extensive network of individual pharmacists. Our sales representatives visit pharmacists frequently, ensuring strong in-store visibility of our brands and facilitating pharmacist education programs. Our sales, marketing, and regulatory teams use training/merchandising teams who work in conjunction with local sales representatives to improve our brands' presence and recognition. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have combined our traditional sales efforts with telesales to find the optimal sales model and to keep employees and customers safe. We seek to attract key talent from leading OTC, Fast Moving Consumer Goods ("FMCG"), and retailer companies to build strong local teams throughout the countries in which the CSCI segment operates. 

The CSCI segment markets products using intensive broadcast and digital advertising as well as point-of-sale promotional spending to enhance brand equity. Key marketing communication tools for the CSCI segment include television and digital commercials, consumer leaflets, product websites, targeted promotional campaigns and communication programs for health care professionals.

Competition

The competitive landscape of the European consumer products market in the categories in which we compete is highly fragmented, as local companies often hold leadership positions in individual product lines in particular countries. As a result, the relevant competition in each of the CSCI segment's markets is both local and global. Global competitors include GSK, Sanofi, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser, Teva, Viatris, Stada, Novartis, Procter & Gamble and e-commerce companies, as well as additional regional competitors. We believe our key advantage lies in our unique combination of best practices in sales, marketing, and product development. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for additional information and risks associated with competition.

INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Trademarks, Patents and Licensing Agreements

While we own certain trademarks and patents, neither our business as a whole, nor any of our segments, is materially dependent upon our ownership of any one trademark, or patent, or group of trademarks or patents. 

Materials Sourcing

Affordable, high-quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials and packaging components, due to their technical specifications and product delivery systems, may be more limited, as they are available from one or only a few suppliers and may require extensive compatibility testing before we can use them. 

Historically, we have been able to react effectively, yet not always immediately, to situations that require alternate sourcing. Should such alternate sourcing be necessary, FDA requirements placed on products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results. We believe we have good, cooperative working relationships with our suppliers and have historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to our volume of purchases. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with materials sourcing. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview for a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our material sourcing.

Manufacturing and Distribution

Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the U.S. We also have manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Belgium, France, Germany, Austria, Mexico, China, and Australia, along with a joint venture in China. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with our manufacturing facilities. We supplement our production capabilities with the purchase of products from outside sources. The capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times for various reasons, such as customer demand, the seasonality of certain product categories (for example, our cough/cold/flu and allergy products), and new product launches. We may utilize available capacity by performing contract manufacturing for other companies. We have logistics facilities in the U.S., Mexico, Australia, and numerous locations throughout Europe. We use contract freight and common carriers to deliver our products. Refer to Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis - Executive Overview for a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our manufacturing and distribution.

Significant Customers 

We have one significant customer that represents approximately 14% of our consolidated net sales. While we have other important customers, no other individual customer represents more than 10% of net sales. However, the loss of one or more of our customers could be material. We believe we generally have good relationships with our customers. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with customers.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Environmental 

Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We undergo periodic internal audits relating to environmental, health and safety requirements in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have made, and continue to make, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws; however, we do not believe that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations have been or will be material to our business. We do not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding.

While we believe that climate change could present risks to our business, including increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to our facilities, water limitations, and disruptions to our supply chain, we do not believe these risks are material to our business in the near term. 

Human Capital Resources

We are passionate about making lives better. At Perrigo, we believe that the continuous personal and professional development of our people is an important component of our ability to attract, retain, and motivate top talent, which are all important aspects of our self-care strategy. Our global workforce consists of more than 9,900 full time and part time employees spread across 34 countries, of which approximately 21% were covered by collective bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2021. We continuously endeavor to provide a diverse, inclusive, and safe work environment so our colleagues can bring their best to work, every day. We are all responsible for upholding Perrigo’s Core Values - Integrity, Respect, and Responsibility - in addition to the Perrigo Code of Conduct which, together, form the foundation of all our policies, procedures, and practices. Together, we drive Perrigo forward to deliver on our vision to make lives better by bringing Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products that consumers trust everywhere they are sold.

Diversity and Inclusion

We strive for our workforce to represent the diverse consumer base we wish to serve enabling us to continue to deliver on our self-care promise. We believe diverse representation and practicing inclusion creates lasting benefits for Perrigo colleagues, our customers, consumers, and shareholders through enhanced team performance, innovation, and profitable growth. To accomplish this objective, we rolled out a three-year strategy at the beginning of 2020 that focuses on three key diversity and inclusion areas: 

•Educating our workforce on our diversity and inclusion strategy and initiatives; 

•Strengthening our talent management practices through a lens of equity and inclusion; and

•Creating diversity and inclusion governance and accountability to establish our foundation and help us monitor progress. 

Perrigo is committed to the well-being of the communities we serve and the individuals who work with us. Accordingly, we continue to take action to help address oppression and inequality based on multiple aspects of diversity. We understand the devastating impact that systemic oppression, injustice, and acts of violence have on underrepresented communities. Murray Kessler, President and CEO, has encouraged all Perrigo colleagues to stand united and take responsibility to learn how each of us can play a role in promoting inclusion and fighting both discrimination and implicit bias in the workplace and in our society as a whole. These efforts include open dialogues between our Board of Directors and Executive Operating Committee on topics including diversity, equity and inclusivity. Our Perrigo colleagues, including senior management, continually receive educational resources and information on how to best serve as allies in support of underrepresented groups and to learn how we can contribute to healing our society's divisions. All colleagues are encouraged to practice self-care and are provided support resources such as our global Employee Assistance Program that includes staff members who identify with various underrepresented communities and speak multiple languages.

Compensation, Benefits, Health, Safety, and Well-being

Perrigo’s commitment to self-care starts with our own team. Our top priority during the global COVID-19 pandemic has been, and continues to be, the safety of our colleagues. When faced with the challenges of this pandemic, we focused on understanding and supporting each diverse individual and the unique circumstances impacting their ability to serve as an essential worker. We have implemented safety measures to protect our on-site essential colleagues, while asking those who can safely work from home to do so. On-site, we've implemented a 

14

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

multi-step pre-screening process before entry into any facility, deep-cleaning protocols, and other safety precautions, all consistent with the rules and guidelines in each jurisdiction.

We strive to provide pay, benefits and services that support the total well-being of our people. Our total rewards package delivers competitive pay, broad-based stock grants, cash-based annual incentives, healthcare, retirement benefits, paid time off, and on-site services, among other benefits. 

Perrigo’s total rewards complement a strong health and safety culture that continues with our global well-being program designed to inspire colleagues to maintain and improve their health. Launched in 2016, Perrigo’s "HEALTHYyou" well-being program continues to support colleagues and their families as they navigate their own self-care and well-being journeys. Our colleagues highly value this program and it continues to be recognized externally by receiving the Best and Brightest in Wellness™ Award in each year since 2017.

Growth, Development, and Engagement

We are committed to engaging our colleagues and fostering a belonging culture, where our people feel enabled to contribute their best to Perrigo's self-care transformation. This includes initiatives supporting overall job satisfaction, diversity and inclusion, personal and professional skill development, work/life balance, and an environment that encourages good health and safety, while upholding our core values of Integrity, Respect, and Responsibility. 

Perrigo regularly conducts global engagement surveys to gather feedback from colleagues to identify strengths and opportunities within our culture. We have implemented a competency model to clarify the behaviors that reinforce our culture and lead to success at Perrigo. Additionally, we use a variety of channels to facilitate open and direct communication, including regular open forums and town hall meetings with our executive leadership team. 

Our development philosophy focuses on a 70-20-10 approach, which provides a practical, blended framework for learning to support individual long-term success (where individuals obtain 70% of their knowledge from job-related experiences, 20% from interactions with others, and 10% from formal educational events). We have significantly expanded our learning capabilities by providing access to extensive on-demand self-study content to colleagues. We believe this model enables our people to deliver on our self-care vision by empowering them to be their best and make a difference to Perrigo Colleagues, Customers, Consumers, Communities, and Shareholders. 

Corporate Social Responsibility

We are committed to doing business in a socially, environmentally and fiscally responsible manner. That commitment is reflected in our well-established governance, corporate responsibility and sustainability programs, as well as by our board oversight of governance and sustainability. A summary of our environmental and social initiatives is below, and additional details can be found in our 2021 Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) Report available on our website. In 2020, we adopted the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (“UN SDG”) as a global framework and committed to six goals within the UN SDG framework. In 2021, we set new specific objectives and targets for the next five years related to each of these goals, which are detailed in our 2021 CSR report. Our progress towards achieving these goals and objectives will be updated in our subsequent CSR reports on an annual basis. 

•Environmental: we are committed to manufacturing our products responsibly, supporting the global drive to reduce carbon emissions and minimize our impact on the climate. We formalized our commitment to sustainability in 2015 by establishing a corporate sustainability strategy focused on reducing the environmental impact of our operations, product packaging, and supply chain. In 2020, we enhanced that strategy by committing to Goal 12: Responsible Production and Consumption and Goal 13: Climate Action, of the UN SDG.

•Social: Our vision is to make lives better, by bringing quality affordable self-care products that consumers trust, everywhere they are sold. This puts the social impact of our business front and center. We are proud to maintain goals and programs relating to Diversity and Inclusion, Human Capital Management, Human Rights, and Community Engagement and Giving. In 2020, as part of our social initiatives, we committed to Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being, Goal 4: Quality Education, Goal 5: Gender Equality, and Goal 10: Reducing Inequality, of the UN SDG.

Regulation

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICING 

The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, advertising, and selling of our products are subject to regulation by a variety of agencies in the localities in which our products are sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by various organizations. We believe that our policies, operations, and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which we are subject. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for related risks.

United States Regulation

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

The FDA has jurisdiction over OTC drug products, API, medical devices and Infant Formula products. The FDA’s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of these products. We are committed to consistently providing our customers with high quality products that adhere to "current Good Manufacturing Practices" ("cGMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA. If the FDA or comparable regulatory authority becomes aware of new safety information about any of our products, these authorities may require further inspection, enhancement to manufacturing controls, labeling changes, additional testing method requirements, restrictions on indicated uses or marketing, post-approval studies or post-market surveillance. 

OTC

All facilities where OTC products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, or distributed for the U.S. market must comply with FDA cGMPs and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries, states and localities where the facilities are located. All of our drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. 

Many of our OTC products are regulated under the OTC monograph system and subject to certain FDA regulations. Under this system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. Products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula, and labeling requirements, including permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients, and dosage levels. It is generally less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. 

Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ("FFDCA") (the Hatch-Waxman amendments), a company submitting an NDA can obtain a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for an OTC product if it performs a clinical study that is essential to FDA approval. Longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities, orphan drugs (those designated under section 526 of the FFDCA) and drugs under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act. During this exclusivity period, the FDA cannot approve any ANDAs for a similar or equivalent generic product, which can preclude another party from marketing a similar product during this period. A company may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if it conducts pediatric studies requested by the FDA on the product. This exclusivity can delay both the FDA approval and sales of certain products.

Under certain circumstances, the first filer of an ANDA may be entitled to a 180-day generic exclusivity period for certain products. This exclusivity period often follows a patent certification and litigation process whereby the product innovator may sue for infringement. The legal action does not ordinarily result in material damages, but it generally triggers a statutorily mandated delay in FDA approval of the ANDA for a period of up to 30 months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge. 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") was signed into law on July 9, 2012. The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, and changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain. The FDASIA also reduced the time required for FDA responses to generic-blocking citizen petitions. We implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self-identification and user fee requirements of the FDASIA, and we monitor facility self-identification and fee payment compliance to mitigate the risk of potential supply chain interruptions or delays in regulatory approval of new applications.

The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 created a pathway by which the FDA may, at the request of an applicant, designate a drug with “inadequate generic competition” as a Competitive Generic Therapy ("CGT"). At the 

16

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

request of the applicant, the FDA may expedite the development and review of an ANDA for a drug designated as a CGT. The first approved application for a drug with a CGT designation for which there are no unexpired patents or exclusivities listed in the Orange Book at the time of original submission of the ANDA may be eligible for 180 days of generic exclusivity.

Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients

Third parties develop and manufacture APIs for use in certain of our pharmaceutical products that are sold in the U.S. and other global markets. API manufacturers typically submit a drug master file to the regulatory authority that provides the proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance, and the facilities and procedures must be cGMP compliant before API may be exported to the U.S. 

Medical Devices

We are subject to the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the FFDCA and its subsequent amendments in the US. The regulations issued thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including some of our products marketed under our oral care and OTC businesses. All of our current medical devices fall under Class I or Class II of the regulations. These products do not require premarket approval but may or may not require a 510(k) premarket notification depending on whether or not the product is 510(k) exempt. These devices are also subject to other general controls established by the FDA, such as registration, listing, labeling, and reporting obligations.

Infant Formula

The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has labeling responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether an infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.

All manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients, which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives. The Infant Formula Act provides specific requirements for infant formula to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas, including minimum and, in some cases, maximum levels of specified nutrients.

Before marketing a particular infant formula, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation consistent with the FDA’s labeling, nutrient content, and manufacturer quality control requirements. A manufacturer must notify the FDA at least 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. We actively monitor this process and make the appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with recent FDA rules regarding cGMP, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records for the production of infant formulas.

In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life; to keep records on production, testing, and distribution of each batch of infant formula; to use cGMP and quality control procedures; and to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which may reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula, inspects new facilities during early production runs, and collects and analyzes samples of infant formula. Our infant formula manufacturing facilities have been inspected by the FDA with no corrective actions required from the most recent inspections.

Our infant and toddler beverages are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which protects the safety of U.S. foods by mandating comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. Under FSMA, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers and is taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of a safety issue. 

17

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

U.S. Department of Agriculture 

The Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic." Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") National Organic Program for production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products and are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the main regulatory body in the United States governing environmental regulation. Laws administered by the EPA, often in partnership with state agencies, include but are not limited to the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.

U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration 

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA") and the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery Treatment for Patients and Communities Act ("SUPPORT Act"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose registration, security, record keeping, suspicious order monitoring, reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V, with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. We are subject to the requirements regarding List I chemicals. Our facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any List 1 Chemicals must register annually with the DEA.

The DEA inspects all registered facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting, and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration, and it also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of DEA regulated substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registration, or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. We are also subject to state laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of certain products.

Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation

In the U.S., government healthcare programs such as Medicaid are important third-party payers for patients treated with our products. While these programs may cover OTC products under some circumstances, utilization of our products under these programs is limited. When covering our products, these programs regulate the amount pharmacies and other healthcare providers are paid for our products. We participate in the following programs, and are subject to associated price reporting, payment, and other compliance obligations: 

•Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (“MDRP”)—We are required to report pricing data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) on a monthly and quarterly basis, and to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on units of our drugs covered by such programs.

•340B Drug Pricing Program—We are required to charge certain healthcare providers, known as 340B “covered entities,” no more than the statutorily-defined 340B “ceiling price” for our covered outpatient drugs, and must report the 340B ceiling price to the government.

•Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”)—We anticipate participating in the FSS contracting program, which would require us to charge certain agencies (the VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard) no more than a statutory Federal Ceiling Price for certain drugs. FSS contracts include extensive disclosure and certification requirements and standard government terms and conditions with which we would have to comply. We would also expect to enter into an agreement to pay rebates on innovator drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.

18

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

 Calculations of the data we must submit under the foregoing programs are governed by statutory and regulatory requirements that are complex, vary among products and programs, can change over time, and are subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. Failure to comply with program obligations may result in civil monetary penalties and other punitive measures and liability, such as exclusion from some programs. We cannot be certain that our submissions will not be found by the government to be incomplete or incorrect. Refer to the risk factors under the heading “If we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the MDRP or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could be material" in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks.

Medicare Part D “Coverage Gap” Rebates

If we market certain innovator products, we will have to provide rebates with respect to utilization by certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries while those patients are within the Part D benefit “coverage gap.” The rebate amount is calculated by CMS based on Part D plans “negotiated prices” paid to pharmacies.

Other Price Regulation and State Regulation

Drug pricing has come under increasing public scrutiny. Congress is considering various amendments to federal drug pricing laws and new forms of pricing regulation which would increase the financial and compliance burdens associated with our participation in the federal programs. Several states have enacted laws that, among other things, require manufacturers to report information concerning drug pricing or marketing practices or to provide advance notice of price actions or applications for regulatory approvals. These laws provide for penalties in case of errors or failure to comply. Refer to the risk factors under the headings "Limitations on reimbursement, continuing healthcare reforms, and changes to reimbursement methods in the U.S. and other counties may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations" and “If we fail to comply with the reporting and payment obligations under the MDRP or other governmental purchasing and rebate programs, we could be subject to fines or penalties, which could be material” in Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks.

Other U.S. Regulations and Organizations

We are subject to various other federal, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products requires substantial effort, expense and capital investment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations, legislation, regulations and laws that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

•Physician Payment Sunshine Act and Similar State Laws - This act and similar state laws require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payment database and public reporting of the payment data.

•Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") - This act and other similar anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.

•Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") - This agency oversees the advertising and other promotional practices of consumer products marketers. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC also reviews mergers and acquisitions of companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigates certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry. 

•International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") - The ISO Standards specify requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement. Our infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually.

19

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

•United States Pharmacopoeia Convention, Inc. ("USP") - The USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. By reference, the FFDCA incorporates the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.

•Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") - HIPAA is a set of regulations designed to protect personal information and data collected and stored in medical records. It established a national standard to be used in all doctors' offices, hospitals and other businesses where personal medical information is stored. In addition to protecting personal medical information, HIPAA also gives patients the right to view their medical records and request changes if the data is incorrect. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.

•Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") - The CPSC has published regulations requiring child resistant packaging on certain products including pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements. 

•California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act ("Prop 65") - Prop 65 is a toxic right-to-know warnings law that allows the state attorney general and private enforcers to sue on behalf of the public claiming the products in question sold in California violate the law by exposing consumers to chemicals in levels above those allowed by regulation without carrying warnings.

•California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") - CCPA went into effective on January 1, 2020, which enhanced the data protection rights of residents in California. This law increases our responsibility and potential liability related to personal data of California residents that we process.

•Other State Agencies - We are subject to regulation by numerous other state health departments, insurance departments, boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies, state consumer health and safety regulations, and other comparable state agencies, each of which have license requirements and fees that vary by state.

Regulation Outside the U.S.

We develop and manufacture products and market third-party manufactured products in regions outside the U.S., including Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Asia, South America, and the Middle East, each of which has its own regulatory environment. The majority of our sales outside the U.S. are in the following categories: OTC pharmaceuticals, infant formulas, medical devices, dietary supplements, cosmetics, biocides and oral care products. Other regulatory agencies, organizations and legislation that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

•Privacy Regulations - We are subject to numerous global laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR introduced more stringent data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we have put in place appropriate mechanisms to comply with the GDPR.

•Transparency Laws - In various jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the laws and regulations aimed at increasing transparency of financial relationships between healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical/medical device manufacturers. These acts require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

•Anti-Bribery Laws - Various jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act 2018, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. 

20

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

•Rules and Regulations Infant Formula - Outside of the U.S., country-specific regulations define the requirements that we must comply with regarding the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of infant formula. We are subject to ongoing periodic inspection through these complex regulations, including by the FDA and other regulatory agencies such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA").

European Union 

On July 14, 2021, the European Commission adopted a set of proposals to ensure polices are aligned with the goal of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 – the EU Green Deal. There is a growing focus on environmental impact of self-care products, their ingredients, components, packaging, manufacturing, and disposal. This focus could lead to new requirements and restrictions in the coming years across all product categories described below. 

OTC 

The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market. However, obtaining regulatory agreement across member states presents complex challenges that can lead to delays in the regulatory process. 

In the EU, as well as many other locations around the world, the manufacture and sale of medicinal products are regulated in a manner substantially similar to that of the U.S. requirements, which generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing, and importation of any medicinal product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain data related to product efficacy and safety, including results of clinical testing and/or references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or if it is manufactured or marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions.

The legislation governing the European pharmaceutical industry is subject to an ongoing consultation and extensive review. Updates to the existing pharmaceutical law are anticipated to be implemented in 2023. These updates could bring opportunity in terms of increased flexibility in some areas but also risk as certain aspects of the law are made more restrictive.

Between 1995 and 1998, the over-arching regulation that governs medicinal products was revised in an attempt to simplify and harmonize product registration. This revised legislation introduced the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), whereby after approval of a marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in the reference member state (“RMS”), additional marketing authorizations could be submitted to other concerned member states to obtain a product license. In November 2005, the medicinal product legislation was further revised to introduce the decentralized procedure (“DCP”), whereby marketing authorizations are submitted simultaneously to the RMS and select concerned member states. In 2005, the EMA also opened up the centralized procedure to sponsors of marketing authorizations for generic medicinal products. Unlike the MRP and DCP, the centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization and product labeling across all member states that will allow a sponsor to file for individual country reimbursement and make the medicine available in all the EU countries listed on the application. Marketing authorizations and subsequent product licenses are granted to applicants only after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 

In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer’s facilities obtain approval from an EU Regulatory Authority. The EU has a code of GMP that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. We believe that our policies, operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which our operations are subject.

In 2011, it was first proposed that the EU Member States had to transition to the European Falsified Medicines Directive (the “Directive”). The Directive was subsequently written into national law on January 2, 2013. The Directive made reference to a Delegated Act (the Delegated Act lists the detailed requirements for 

21

Regulation

manufacturers). The Delegated Act was finalized and published in February 2017, and it provided for a two-year implementation period. We are in compliance with the Delegated Act. The provisions of the Directive are intended to reduce the risk of counterfeit medicines entering the supply chain and also to ensure the quality of API manufactured outside of the EU. The Directive required the serialization of all Rx and some OTC products, similar to the DSCSA in the U.S.

The European Commission passed legislation requiring new product packaging ‘safety features’ to prevent falsification of medicinal products primarily within the prescription medicines sector. All marketing authorization holders in the EU member states and EEA members Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland were required to introduce the necessary changes by February 9, 2019 (or risk forfeiting their product licenses). However, manufacturers based out of Greece, Belgium and Italy have an extended timeline until February 9, 2025 to implement the serialization guidelines as they already feature similar requirements on their current drug packages.

Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, although the application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.

The requirements deriving from European pharmacovigilance regulation are constantly expanding due to increasing guidance on good vigilance practices and increased communication on inspectors’ expectations. Pharmacovigilance fee regulation became effective in late 2014 to support health authority assessment of pharmacovigilance safety evaluation reports, study protocols for post authorization safety studies and referrals. Once approved, the advertising of pharmaceuticals in the EU is governed by national regulations and guidelines. Within certain member states this is overseen by a self-certification process whereas in others national governance bodies approve material prior to release.

The wholesale distribution channel is an important activity in the integrated supply chain management for medical products. The quality and the integrity of medicinal products can be affected by a lack of adequate control. To this end, the EU Commission has published guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use in 2013. The present guidelines are based on Articles 84 and 85b(3) of medicinal products for human use directive. 

Medical Devices

The EU has enacted into law numerous directives and adopted many harmonizing standards pertaining to a wide range of industrial products, including medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of applicable directives are entitled to bear the CE marking of conformity, which indicates that the device conforms to the applicable requirements of the directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state. Assessment by a Notified Body includes an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and may also include specific testing of the product. This assessment is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. On May 25, 2017, the EU’s Medical Device Regulation (the “MDR”) became effective, with a three year transitional period until full application. The date of application of the MDR, and as a result the date of repeal of the existing Medical Device Directives (the "MDDs"), was deferred by 12 months to May 26, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All Class I (low risk) medical devices needed to comply with the MDR by May 26, 2021, and all medical devices sold in the EU will need to be approved under the MDR by May 26, 2025. Notified Bodies, which are organizations accredited by a member state, were able to approve medical devices under the MDDs until May 26, 2021. Beginning on May 27, 2021, Notified Bodies are no longer able to approve new medical devices under the MDDs or approve notifications of “substantial” design changes, including changes to labeling/packaging, changes to the manufacturing process, or the addition of new features and functionality, to medical devices that were approved under the MDDs. 

Only Notified Bodies that have been designated under the MDR can carry out conformity assessment procedures, and only for certain types of devices listed by the product codes in their designation. This designation process is a lengthy and costly process, resulting in a shortage of certified notified bodies, which has created bottlenecks due to an insufficient number of designated Notified Bodies and trained personnel, constraining the availability of medical devices. Stricter guidelines for substance-based devices (classification rules; interpretation of the definitions of pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic means) under the MDR are expected.

Regulation

We can expect possible divergence on the medical device regulatory framework from non-EU markets such as the UK after Brexit. In addition, in 2021, the mutual recognition agreement between EU and Switzerland on medical devices has ceased.

Dietary Supplements

Complying with the legislative framework for dietary supplements in the EU remains challenging as a result of changing EU regulations, diverging national regulations from EU regulations, and diverging regulations between EU member states.

Dietary supplements are subject to several regulations that inform the selection of ingredient levels and how products can be described on packaging and in advertising. These regulations include: Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC, Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, Permitted Vitamins and Minerals Regulation (EC) 1170/2009, Food Additives Regulation (EC) 1333/2008, Nutritional & Health Claims Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Foods Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses Directive 2009/39/EC, and Regulation (EU) 609/2013.

EU rules on nutrition and health claims, which were established by Regulation EC 1924/2006, apply to any nutritional or health claim by a manufacturer. The objective of the regulation is to ensure that claims made in food labeling or advertising are clear, accurate and based on scientific evidence. The European Food Safety Authority, an advisory panel to the European Commission, performs all scientific assessments of health claims on food and supplement labels. An EU register of nutrition and health claims exists to document approved, pending, and rejected claims.

Increased scrutiny from the EU Commission is likely to result in further ingredient reviews that could trigger additional market measures and reformulations. Ingredients under growing scrutiny, such as nanomaterials and food additives, are likely to be subject to review and stricter measures, as well as their use in certain vulnerable population groups.

Cosmetics

Cosmetic products in the EU market must comply with Regulation EC No. 1223/2009. This regulation requires manufacturers to prepare a product safety report prior to placing a cosmetic product in the market. In addition, for each cosmetic product placed in the market, a “responsible person” must be designated to oversee compliance with the regulation’s reporting requirements. Commission Regulation EU No. 655/2013 establishes the common criteria and justification for claims to be used in the packaging and advertising of cosmetics products. A revision of the existing regulation is currently under consultation and is expected to be implemented by the end of 2022. It is anticipated that additional restriction criteria would be included in the revised regulation, thus expanding the scope of ingredients that could have their use in cosmetics restricted.

Increased scrutiny from the EU Commission is likely to result in further ingredient reviews that could trigger additional market measures and reformulations. Reviews are also likely in relation to the EU Green Deal (as defined below) a review regarding microplastics is ongoing as well as ingredients in sunscreens, endocrine disruptors, nanomaterials, and skin sensitisers. 

Biocides

Biocides in the EU market must comply with Regulation EU No. 528/2012 ("EU BPR") overseen by the European Chemicals Agency. Contrary to medicines, biocides are not exempted from chemical legislation such as the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals No. 1907/2006 and the Regulation on Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation of substances and mixtures EC No. 1272/2008. The EU BPR improves the functioning of the biocidal products market in the EU, while ensuring a high level of protection for humans and the environment through the implementation of a harmonized system at Union level. Biocides are currently transitioning from a national-based system to a European system. The transition involves the gradual integration and approval or re-approval of existing active substances, followed by the pre-market authorization of biocidal finished products. This means all biocidal products will need to complete the reauthorization process, with the assessment focusing on efficacy and safety of the biocides on the European market.

Regulation

General Product Safety Directive

The General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC) complements sector-specific legislation such as rules that apply to electrical and electronic goods, chemicals, and other specific product groups. Together, the General Product Safety Directive and sector specific legislation ensure the safety and traceability of products in the market (other than pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food which are regulated under separate legislation). If our products fail to meet the General Product Safety Directive, we may incur fines.

The current directive is due to be repealed and replaced with a regulation with additional and stricter requirements for products being placed on the EU market. Publication is expected in 2022 and entry would likely become effective six months after publication. It is anticipated that the changes to be introduced by the Regulation will affect products in the Oral care category.

Additional Global Regulations and Considerations 

We must comply with a variety of U.S. laws related to doing business outside of the U.S., including but not limited to, Office of Foreign Asset Controls; United Nations and EU sanctions; the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012; rules relating to the use of certain “conflict minerals” under Section 1502 of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act; and regulations enforced by the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol. Changes in laws, regulations, and practices affecting the pharmaceutical industry and the healthcare system, including imports, exports, manufacturing, quality, cost, pricing, reimbursement, approval, inspection, and delivery of healthcare, may affect our business and operations. International sanctions and boycotts of our products could also impact our sales and ability to export our products.

In recent years, there has been growing concern about the use and misuse of opioids and related products in the United States and around the world. Natural and synthetic opioids have analgesic and sedative effects, and are commonly prescribed by medical professionals for the temporary management of pain. Clinically weaker opioid analgesics, such as products containing codeine, are available from pharmacists in certain jurisdictions without a doctor’s prescription. However, a number of jurisdictions have implemented or are considering restrictions on OTC products containing codeine. For example, in 2018, Australia reclassified codeine to require a prescription, and regulators in Ireland and the UK may be evaluating similar actions. Certain formulations of the branded pain medications we sell in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions contain codeine. Restrictions or prohibitions on the sale of OTC products containing codeine could affect our CSCI segment in future periods.

Recent Changes to Tax Laws, Regulations and Related Interpretations

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), which represents a coalition of member countries, has recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles relating to Base Erosion and Profit Shifting ("BEPS"). These changes are being adopted and implemented by many of the countries in which we do business and may increase our tax expense in these countries. Building on the first BEPS project, the OECD began a new project in 2019, which has evolved into a two Pillar approach to address the pressure put on the current international tax system due to digitalization and globalization. The current project, referred to as BEPS 2.0, is being conducted through the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework, which now counts 141 participating countries. Pillar One of the project focuses on development of new nexus and profit allocation rules to assign more taxing rights to market countries. Pillar Two focuses on development of new global minimum tax rules. On December 20, 2021, the OECD released the Model Rules on Pillar Two Global Minimum Tax. Implementation of the Model Rules will lead to significant changes to the overall international tax rules under which companies operate. The new rules will subject large multinational corporations to a global minimum corporation tax of 15% and introduce new filing obligations that will impose onerous data gathering requirements and additional internal reporting processes and systems. On December 22, 2021, the European Commission issued a draft Directive to implement Pillar 2 in the European Union. The Commission proposes that the Directive be finalized by mid-2022 and transposed into domestic law of the member states to be effective January 1, 2023. 

On March 27, 2020, the U.S. enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”). The CARES Act allowed for an increased interest expense limitation and depreciation deductions resulting in a reduction of income tax expense of approximately $36.6 million for tax years 2019 and 2020. Additionally, Treasury and the IRS issued Proposed and Final Regulations in 2020 regarding interest expense limitations under Section 163(j). These regulations adjust the definition of interest expense and items allowable in adjusted taxable

income to calculate the annual interest deduction limitation. Perrigo applied the updated regulations resulting in a reduction of income tax expense of approximately $8.9 million during 2020.

On December 28, 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS released final foreign tax credit regulations addressing various aspects of the foreign tax credit (“FTC”) regime. These regulations finalize, among other guidance, provisions relating to the disallowance of a credit or deduction for foreign income taxes with respect to dividends eligible for a dividends-received deduction; the allocation and apportionment of interest expense, foreign income tax expense; the definition of a foreign income tax and a tax in lieu of an income tax; transition rules relating to the impact on loss accounts of net operating loss carrybacks; the definition of foreign branch category income; and the time at which foreign taxes accrue and can be claimed as a credit. The regulations also contain clarifying rules relating to foreign-derived intangible income (FDII). These regulations are, generally, effective on March 7, 2022, with some provisions having retroactive effect. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we evaluated whether these final FTC regulations would have any effect on our income tax reporting for the year ended December 31, 2021, and applicable prior periods, and concluded that these final FTC regulations do not result in any material changes to our income tax reporting for the year ended December 31, 2021 or for any prior periods. We will continue to evaluate the effects of these final FTC regulations on future accounting periods.

Foreign Incorporation Considerations

Although we are incorporated in Ireland, the IRS may not agree with the conclusion that we are treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. For Perrigo Company plc to be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes under section 7874 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), either (i) the former stockholders of Perrigo Company must own (within the meaning of section 7874 of the Code) less than 80% (by both vote and value) of our stock by reason of holding shares in Perrigo Company (the "ownership test") as of the closing of the Elan acquisition or (ii) we must have substantial business activities in Ireland after the Elan acquisition (taking into account the activities of our expanded affiliated group). Upon our acquisition of Elan, Perrigo Company stockholders held 71% (by both vote and value) of our shares. We believe that under current law, we should be treated as a foreign corporation for U.S. federal tax purposes. However, we cannot assure that the IRS will agree with our position that the ownership test is satisfied. There is limited guidance regarding the section 7874 provisions, including the application of the ownership test. Based on the limited guidance available, we currently expect that Section 7874 of the Code likely will limit our and our U.S. affiliates’ ability to use their U.S. tax attributes, such as net operating losses, to offset certain U.S. taxable income, if any, generated by the Elan acquisition or certain specified transactions for a period of time following the Elan acquisition. Refer to Item 8. Note 17.
