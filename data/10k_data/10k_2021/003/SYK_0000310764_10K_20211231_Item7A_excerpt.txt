ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

We sell our products globally and, as a result, our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as market risk exposure from weak economic conditions, exchange rate risk and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial results. Our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the United States Dollar, Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Euro and Japanese Yen. We develop and manufacture products in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Turkey and incur costs in the applicable local currencies. This global deployment of facilities serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on our cost of sales. Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our use of derivative instruments to mitigate these risks. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currencies relative to the United States Dollar would change the December 31, 2021 fair value of these instruments by approximately $514. 

We are not able to quantify the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial results. Qualitative disclosures about the COVID-19 pandemic are included in Part II, Item 7 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Form 10-K.
