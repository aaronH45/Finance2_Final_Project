PART I  

Item 1. Business  

Overview  

Tripadvisor operates the world’s largest travel guidance platform, connecting a global audience of prospective travelers with travel partners through rich content, price comparison tools, and online reservation and related services for destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants. Our mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip.  

In 2000, under our flagship brand Tripadvisor, we launched www.Tripadvisor.com in the U.S. Since then, we have built a portfolio of travel guidance brands and businesses, seamlessly connecting travelers to destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants in over 40 markets and over 20 languages worldwide. As of December 31, 2021, Tripadvisor featured more than 1 billion reviews and opinions on nearly 8 million hotels and other accommodations, restaurants, experiences, airlines and cruises.  

In addition to the flagship Tripadvisor brand, we own and operate a portfolio of online travel brands and businesses, operating under various websites, including the following: www.bokun.io, www.cruisecritic.com, www.flipkey.com, www.thefork.com, www.helloreco.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.jetsetter.com, www.niumba.com, www.seatguru.com, www.singleplatform.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and www.viator.com.  

Our Industry and Market Opportunity  

We operate in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel and travel-related activity, and the online advertising market. The global travel market (which excludes dining) is expected to reach $1.4 trillion of bookings in 2022, according to Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm. 

As consumer travel media consumption and travel commerce activity has increasingly moved online, we believe travel and travel-related businesses will continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels in order to grow their businesses. We serve the needs of both the consumers and travel partners that operate within this market.  

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant negative impact on the travel, hospitality, restaurant, and leisure industries and consequently adversely and materially affected our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Uncertainty continues over travel due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including how quickly global travel will recover, and how the future travel experience will be changed and shaped by the pandemic. However, we believe that, while the pandemic could permanently change travel in certain ways, global travel will return to pre-pandemic levels. Consumers want to connect with others, learn about new places and see things they have not seen before. We believe this passion for travel, combined with the need to make informed choices, creates significant long-term growth opportunities for our business. 

Our Business Model  

On a global scale, we match consumer demand for travel with travel partners that offer accommodations, restaurants and other travel related experiences. Consumers come to the Tripadvisor platform directly via our branded site, www.tripadvisor.com, our mobile app, and through organic and paid search channels for those searching for information on accommodations, tours, activities, attractions and general visitor information for particular locations, and through sites included in our portfolio of brands.  

Value Proposition to Consumers 

Tripadvisor helps consumers plan, book, and enjoy the trips that matter. Our platform offers consumers access to rich and expansive content, including more than 1 billion traveler reviews and other traveler-generated content such as photos, search and discovery capabilities across a variety of parameters such as location and price, and other informational content that helps drive consumer convenience as they plan and book their perfect trip. We believe this rich content has led Tripadvisor to become a trusted global brand, attracting nearly half a billion monthly unique  

2 

visitors to our platform and influencing a significant amount of travel commerce during peak months prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are focused on creating the best online experience in travel planning and booking, making it easier for consumers to research destinations, experiences and restaurants, read and contribute user-generated content (such as reviews and photos), compare destinations and businesses based on quality, price and availability comparisons, and complete bookings powered by our travel partners.  

Value Proposition to Travel Partners 

The scale of our platform and the traffic to our platform enable our travel partners to be discovered, to advertise, and to sell their services to a global travel audience. These partners may include hotel chains, independent hoteliers, online travel agencies, or OTAs, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers. We enable media advertising opportunities – and in some cases, facilitate transactions between consumers and travel partners in a number of ways, including by sending referrals to our travel partners’ websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of our travel partners, or by serving as the merchant of record – particularly in our Experiences offering – and by offering advertising placements on our platform. 

Business and Products 

We manage our business based on the following reportable segments: (1) Hotels, Media & Platform and (2) Experiences & Dining.  

Our Hotels, Media & Platform segment includes revenue generated from the following sources: 

•

Tripadvisor-branded Hotels Revenue. The largest source of Hotels, Media & Platform segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on Tripadvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant booking links to our travel partners’ websites. Our click-based travel partners are predominantly OTAs and hotels. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or “CPC”, basis, with payments from travel partners determined by the number of travelers who click on a link multiplied by the CPC rate for each specific click. CPC rates are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process, where our travel partner CPC bids for rates and availability to be listed on our platform are submitted. We also generate revenue from our cost-per-action, or “CPA” model, which consists of contextually-relevant booking links to our travel partners’ websites which are advertised on our platform. We earn a commission from our travel partners, based on a pre-determined contractual commission rate, for each traveler who clicks to and books a hotel reservation on the travel partners’ website, which results in a traveler stay.  

In addition, we also provide business-to-business (“B2B”) offerings, including subscription-based advertising to hotels, owners of B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties, enabling subscribers to advertise their businesses on our platform, as well as manage and promote their website URL, email address, phone number, special offers and other information related to their business. Subscription-based advertising services are predominantly sold for a flat fee for a contracted period of time. We also offer travel partners the opportunity to advertise and promote their business through hotel sponsored placements on our platform, generally on a CPC rate basis.  

•

Tripadvisor-branded Display and Platform Revenue. We offer businesses the ability to promote their brands through display-based advertising placements on our platform across all of our segments and business units. Our display-based advertising clients are predominantly direct suppliers of hotels, airlines and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. We also sell display-based advertising to OTAs and other travel related businesses, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis.  

3 

Our Experiences & Dining segment includes revenue generated from the following sources:  

•

Experiences. We provide information and services that allow travelers to research and book tours, activities and attractions (the “experience”) in popular travel destinations in our Viator online marketplace. We also power experience booking capabilities to travelers on third-party distribution partner websites and mobile apps, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains, and online and offline travel agencies, including on the Tripadvisor websites and mobile apps. We work with local experience operators (the “operator”) to provide travelers the ability to book tours, activities and attractions in destinations worldwide. In these transactions we act as the merchant of record and generate commissions for each booking transaction we facilitate through our online reservation system. We also earn commissions from third-party merchant partners, who display and promote on their websites the experiences available on our platform to travelers which generate bookings, in transactions where we are not the merchant of record.  

For the vast majority of experience bookings, we collect the full amount charged to the traveler at the time of booking and remit the operator’s portion after the booked experience occurs, which contributes to positive working capital before the traveler completes the experience. 

•

Dining. We provide information and services for consumers to research and book restaurant reservations in popular travel destinations through our dedicated online restaurant reservations offering, TheFork, and on our Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. We primarily generate transaction fees (or per seated diner fees) that are paid by our restaurant customers for diners seated through TheFork’s online reservation system. We also offer B2B services and generate subscription fees for subscription-based advertising to restaurants, access to certain online reservation management services, marketing analytic tools, and menu syndication services provided by TheFork and Tripadvisor. In addition, we also offer restaurant partners the opportunity to advertise and promote their business through restaurant media advertising placements on our Tripadvisor websites and mobile apps generally on a CPC rate basis. 

We also offer travelers Rentals, Flights & Car, and Cruise solutions on our platform which complement our end-to-end travel experience. Revenue generated through these offerings are combined in Other which is not considered a reportable segment. Our Rentals offering provides information and services that allow travelers to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full homes, condominiums, villas, beach properties, cabins and cottages. Rentals primarily generates revenue, a commission from both the traveler and the property owner, by offering individual property owners and property managers the ability to list their rental properties on our platform thereby connecting with travelers primarily through a free-to-list commission-based option. We generally collect payment from the traveler at the time of booking, representing the amount due to the property owner or manager, as well as our commission. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on our Tripadvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. In addition, we generate revenue from Flights, Cruise, and Car offerings on our platform, which primarily consists of click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue, similar to our Hotels, Media & Platform segment. 

For further information regarding our segments, including the principal revenue streams within these segments and timing of revenue recognition and cashflows, refer to “Note 4: Revenue Recognition” and “Note 20: Segment and Geographic Information” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

Seasonality  

Consumers’ travel expenditures have historically followed a seasonal pattern. Correspondingly, travel partners’ advertising investments, and therefore our revenue and operating profits, have also historically followed a seasonal pattern. Our financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a given year, which includes the seasonal peak in consumer demand, traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters, which represent seasonal low points. During the first half of the year, experiences and rentals bookings typically exceed the amount of completed experiences and rental  

4 

stays, resulting in higher cash flow related to working capital, while during the second half of the year, particularly in the third quarter, this pattern reverses and cash flows from these transactions are typically negative.  

However, as discussed in Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 1: Organization and Business Description” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other factors may also impact typical seasonal fluctuations, which include further significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions that could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends. For example, due to the impact of COVID-19 on our business, we did not experience our typical seasonal pattern for revenue and operating profits during the year ended December 31, 2020. COVID-19 contributed significantly to unfavorable working capital trends and material negative operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020, most notably occurring during the first half of 2020, when we typically generate significant positive cash flow. 

Although consumer travel demand, traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken generally remain materially lower than historic levels, these trends improved during 2021, resulting in increased revenues, and working capital and operating cash flow more akin to typical historical seasonality trends. However, it is difficult to predict the seasonality for 2022, given the sustained uncertainty related to the continued economic and travel impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the ultimate shape and timing of a recovery in our key markets. In addition, significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends.  

Our Long-Term Growth Strategy  

The global travel market (which excludes dining) is expected to reach $1.4 trillion of bookings in 2022, according to Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm. Given we have the world’s largest travel audience, we believe that Tripadvisor’s influence in the travel ecosystem remains significant. Our long-term growth strategy aims to increase consumer engagement on our platform and drive profitable growth through:  

•

offering products that delight travelers by reducing friction throughout the travel planning and trip-taking journey; 

•

driving consumer loyalty to our platform through user experience and by offering products and services that increase engagement with our platform and result in membership growth, new and repeat bookings, mobile app engagement and repeat usage; 

•

driving traveler and diner engagement, bookings, and loyalty on our branded platforms by offering industry-leading choices for online bookable experiences and restaurants in top destinations worldwide; 

•

deepening travel partner engagement on our platform by expanding the number of products and services we offer; and 

•

leveraging our platform’s brand and scale and our unique attributes to expand and grow our offerings such as hotel and restaurant B2B solutions, direct-to-consumer products and services where consumers pay us on a per trip planned or an annual subscription basis and click-based and display-based media advertising. 

We expect to enable our growth through investment in: 

•

organic investment in marketing and technology (e.g., machine learning) to further improve the experiences we can deliver to consumers and travel partners on our platform; and 

•

inorganically by opportunistically pursuing strategic acquisitions. 

Marketing and Competition  

Tripadvisor and its partners compete with other companies across numerous verticals within an attractive and rapidly evolving travel industry. In our daily operations, we compete to attract premier travel community-powered  

5 

content (reviews, photos and other forms of engagement), traffic, advertising dollars and, more generally, the purchasing power of high-intent and highly-valuable consumers seeking to book vacations and spend. Since our travel review content and those of our competitors are typically free, we differentiate based on the awareness and trust travelers and diners place in our brands, the quality and nature of our consumer and B2B product offerings and through the choices available through our online travel search and price comparison services (or metasearch). As such, we invest in improving our consumer experience and expanding travel review content (the core offering within our value proposition), the growth of business listings on our platform that provide choice and the diverse range of bookable experiences we provide travelers during their vacations that create lasting memories. Knowing trust in our platform is paramount to our success and the virtues of our network effect, we also invest in leading the internet industry in our trust and safety initiatives, including providing transparency into our traveler review process and our efforts to combat misinformation and false reviews. 

We also invest to amplify our global brand and raise consumer awareness of, and engagement with, our end-to-end product offerings. With hundreds of millions of visitors to our platform each year, we leverage a number of cost effective online and offline marketing channels to reach travelers and diners, including our own platform channels (i.e. websites and app), online search engines (primarily Google), social media, email, media via public relations, partnerships, and content distribution. The relative success of our marketing strategy is measurable on these channels, and can be influenced by changes that we and our travel partners and competitors make to our respective products and marketing strategies.  

We allocate resources among the different marketing channels based on our internal return on investment measures. We compete globally with both online and offline, established and emerging, providers of travel, hospitality, lodging, experiences (bookable tours, activities, and attractions), and restaurant reservation and related services. The markets for the services we offer are intensely competitive, and current and new competitors can launch new services at a relatively low cost.  

We also compete with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies where we operate, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:  

•

In our Hotels, Media & Platform segment, we compete, and in some cases partner, with the following businesses:  

o

OTAs (including Expedia Group, Inc., or “Expedia,” Booking Holdings, Inc., or “Booking,” and their respective subsidiaries and operating companies, and Airbnb);  

o

hotel metasearch providers (including trivago (a majority-owned subsidiary of Expedia), Kayak and HotelsCombined (subsidiaries of Booking) and Trip.com Group Limited); 

o

large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies (including Google, Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, and Alibaba);  

o

traditional offline travel agencies; and  

o

global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.  

•

As endemic and non-endemic (non-travel) advertisers seek to diversify their display-based advertising spend beyond platforms such as Google and Facebook and their related properties (Instagram and YouTube); Tripadvisor competes with these and other internet media channels for advertising spend, such as Twitter, Pinterest and Snap Media, in addition to fast growing advertising businesses, such as ad-supported retail and entertainment platforms like Amazon, Spotify, and Walmart.com. 

•

We also compete with offerings in our Experiences & Dining segment. Experiences competes with online travel agencies (such as Airbnb, Booking and Expedia), search engines (such as Google), other pure-play experience OTAs (such as GetYourGuide, Peek and Klook), traditional travel agencies and online travel service providers and wholesalers, among others. Our Dining offering competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as Google and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Booking).  

6 

Commercial Relationships  

We have commercial relationships with a majority of the world’s leading OTAs, as well as thousands of other travel partners, pursuant to which these companies primarily purchase traveler leads from us, generally on a click-based advertising basis. Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, we seek to ensure the mutual success of these relationships.  

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 our two most significant travel partners were Expedia and Booking, each of which accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately 34%, 25% and 33% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Nearly all of this concentration of revenue is recorded in the Tripadvisor-branded Hotels revenue line within our Hotels, Media & Platform segment for these reporting periods. Additionally, our business is dependent on relationships with third-party service operators that we rely on to fulfill service obligations to our customers where the Company is the merchant of record, such as our experience providers and vacation rental owners. However, no one operator’s inventory resulted in more than 10% of our revenue on a consolidated basis in any period presented.  

Operations and Technology  

We have assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations and warehousing technologies. We make significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies.  

Our systems infrastructure for Tripadvisor-branded websites is in a "hybrid-cloud" configuration in which parts of it are housed at a colocation facility and managed by our operations team, while the rest is hosted on Amazon Web Services. Our infrastructure installations have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. The colocation facility is protected with both network-level and application-level defenses, using well known commercial solutions specifically tailored for such purposes. We make use of Amazon Web Services availability zones to provide redundancy for the cloud portions of our infrastructure. Substantially all of our software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as backed up at offsite locations. Our systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of our individual subsidiaries and businesses have their own data infrastructure and technology teams. 

Intellectual Property  

Our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of our business. We rely on our intellectual property rights in our content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content. We have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties and these arrangements may place restrictions on the use of our intellectual property.  

We protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, federal, state and common law rights. We protect our brands by pursuing the trademark registration of our core brands, as appropriate, maintaining our trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, we protect our trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program.  

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be  

7 

no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us.  

In connection with our copyrightable content, we post and institute procedures under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar “host privilege” statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs, text and other content loaded on our platform by consumers. However, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, political and regulatory efforts to amend relevant statutes, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to claim immunity.  

From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.  

Regulation  

We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet as well as some relating to the travel industry, the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services. As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into additional international markets and expand our product offerings, we are increasingly subject to additional laws and regulations. This includes laws and regulations regarding privacy and data protection, libel and defamation, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, taxation, online payment services and competition, among others. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Many of these laws and regulations are being tested in courts, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate.  

In addition, we provide advertising data and information and conduct marketing activities that are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements and industry specific value-added tax regimes. The U.S. (as well as individual states), the E.U. (as well as member states) and other countries have adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, data privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. It is difficult to accurately predict how such legislation will be interpreted and applied or whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on our services, and whether or how we might be affected. Increased regulation of the internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.  

We are subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data. As our business has evolved, we have begun to receive and store a greater volume of personally identifiable data. This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world. For example, the E.U., in May 2018, adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies, including ours, to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling and storage of personal data. In addition, the State of California adopted the Consumer Privacy Protection Act which became effective January 1, 2020 and also enhances privacy rights and consumer protection for residents of California. In addition, similar laws have been adopted or are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions. The enactment, interpretation and application of these laws is still in a state of flux.  

Also, on June 23, 2016, the U.K. passed a referendum to exit the E.U., known as Brexit, and the U.K. ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020. On December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. finalized the terms of the departure. While there continues to be some uncertainty around U.K. and E.U. relations, we do not expect Brexit will have a material impact on our business and results of operations; however, we will likely face new regulations and additional hiring costs, as well as hiring limitations from candidates outside of the U.K.  

8 

Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. However, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied in the context of online travel companies, so there can be uncertainty regarding how these requirements may relate to our business in the future. 

Corporate History, Equity Ownership and Voting Control 

Tripadvisor was co-founded in February 2000 by Stephen Kaufer, our current Chief Executive Officer and President. In April 2004, Tripadvisor was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC. In August 2005, IAC spun-off its portfolio of travel brands, including Tripadvisor, into Expedia, at the time a separate newly-formed Delaware corporation. On December 20, 2011 Expedia completed a spin-off of Tripadvisor into a separate publicly-traded Delaware corporation. We refer to this second spin-off transaction as the “Spin-Off.” Following the Spin-Off, on December 21, 2011, Tripadvisor began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, or Nasdaq, as an independent public company under the trading symbol “TRIP.” 

On December 11, 2012, Liberty Interactive Corporation, or Liberty, purchased an aggregate of approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock of Tripadvisor from Barry Diller, our former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, and certain of his affiliates. As a result, Liberty beneficially owned approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.8 million shares of our Class B common stock.  

On August 27, 2014, the entire beneficial ownership of our common stock and Class B common stock held by Liberty was acquired by Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., or LTRIP. Simultaneously, Liberty, LTRIP’s former parent company, distributed, by means of a dividend, to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock, Liberty’s entire equity interest in LTRIP. We refer to this transaction as the “Liberty Spin-Off”. As a result of the Liberty Spin-Off, effective August 27, 2014, LTRIP became a separate, publicly traded company holding 100% of Liberty’s interest in Tripadvisor.  

As a result of these transactions, and as of December 31, 2021, LTRIP beneficially owned approximately 16.4 million shares of our common stock and 12.8 million shares of our Class B common stock, which constitute approximately 13% of the outstanding shares of common stock and 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Assuming the conversion of all of LTRIP’s shares of Class B common stock into common stock, LTRIP would beneficially own approximately 21% of the outstanding common stock. Because each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share, LTRIP may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing nearly 57% of our voting power. 

Human Capital Management, Culture and Employees  

Employees 

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 2,691 employees. Our number of employees increased approximately 4% when compared to the same period in 2020. Approximately 50%, 35%, and 15% of the Company’s current employees are based in Europe, the U.S., and the rest of world, respectively. Additionally, we use independent contractors to supplement our workforce. We believe we have good relationships with our employees and contractors, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations. 

Talent Acquisition and Development 

We believe our employees are essential to our success and that the Company’s success depends on our ability to attract, develop and retain key talent. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of key employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other technical staff, and constrained labor markets have increased competition for personnel across other parts of our business. The Company's management and Board of Directors oversee various initiatives for talent acquisition, retention and development. 

9 

Our talent philosophy is to both develop talent from within and to strategically recruit key external talent. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Our overall talent acquisition and retention strategy is designed to attract and retain diverse and qualified candidates to enable the success of the Company and achievement of our performance goals. We recruit the best people for the job without regard to gender, ethnicity or other protected traits and it is our policy to comply fully with all domestic, foreign and local laws relating to discrimination in the workplace. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.  

We support and develop our employees through global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. Leadership development includes programs for new leaders as well as programs designed to support more experienced leaders. We also partner with external training organizations to help provide current and future workers with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed.  

It is important that our employees represent a mix of experiences and backgrounds in order to make our company stronger, more innovative and more inclusive. Inclusion is one of our core values, and we have programs in place to promote diversity and inclusion. Our diversity and inclusion initiatives support our goal that everyone throughout the Company is engaged in creating an inclusive workplace. We support inclusion through training on topics including Unconscious Bias and Inclusive Leadership. We also support a network of active Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) reflecting many dimensions of diversity across the Company.  

Total Rewards 

As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract, motivate and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare, and retirement benefits.  

We design our benefit programs to meet the needs of our employees’ health while managing program costs for escalation rates at or below industry trend factors. Our programs include but are not limited to wellness, mental health services, telemedicine, and partnerships with service providers that support diverse family-care need solutions. We continuously refine, develop and implement proactive health care strategies and solutions that allow us to enhance employee health and well-being while curbing costs. 

Refer to “Note 14: Employee Benefit Plans” and “Note 15: Stock Based Awards and Other Equity Instruments” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our 401(k) Plan, our equity award plan and other employee benefit plans. 

Health and Safety 

The health and safety of our employees is of utmost importance to us. We conduct regular self-assessments and audits to ensure compliance with our health and safety guidelines and regulatory requirements. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, the Company has taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to protect its workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work, including, but not limited to: 

•

Adding work from home flexibility; 

•

Increasing cleaning protocols across all locations; 

•

Initiating regular communication regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including health and safety protocols and procedures;  

•

Prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential business travel for all employees; and 

•

Requiring masks to be worn in all locations where required by local law.
