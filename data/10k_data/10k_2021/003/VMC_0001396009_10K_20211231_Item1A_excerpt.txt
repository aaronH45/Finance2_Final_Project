ITEM 1

BUSINESS

Vulcan Materials Company operates primarily in the U.S. and is the nation’s largest supplier of construction aggregates (primarily crushed stone, sand and gravel), a major producer of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, and a supplier of construction paving services. We provide the basic materials for the infrastructure needed to maintain and expand the U.S. economy. Delivered by trucks, ships, barges and trains, our products are the indispensable materials building homes, offices, places of worship, schools, hospitals and factories, as well as vital infrastructure including highways, bridges, roads, ports and harbors, water systems, campuses, dams, airports and rail networks. As of December 31, 2021, we had 404 active aggregates facilities as shown below.

While aggregates is our focus and primary business, as of December 31, 2021, we further served our customers through our 69 asphalt facilities and 173 concrete facilities located in Alabama, Arizona, California, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Washington D.C. and the Bahamas.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Our strategy and competitive advantage are based on our strength in aggregates, which are used in most types of construction and in the production of asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete. Our strategy for long-term value creation is built on: (1) an aggregates-focused business, (2) a disciplined approach to growth management and capital allocation, (3) a focus on continuous compounding improvement in profitability, (4) a holistic approach to land management, and (5) our commitment to safety, health and the environment.

1. AGGREGATES FOCUS

Aggregates are used in virtually all types of public and private construction, practically no substitutes for quality aggregates exist, and significant barriers to entry exist in most markets. Vulcan is uniquely positioned as the largest aggregates supplier in the U.S. and the most aggregates-focused public company.

 Source: 2020 reported financial information and Company estimates. VMC excludes U.S. Concrete, which was acquired in August 2021.

Given our focus on aggregates, we:

nTAKE ADVANTAGE OF SIZE AND SCALE: While certain aspects of each aggregates operation are unique, such as its location within a local market and its particular geological characteristics, every operation uses a similar group of assets to produce saleable aggregates and provide customer service. Our 404 active aggregates facilities as of December 31, 2021 provide opportunities to share and scale best practices across our operations and to procure equipment (fixed and mobile), parts, supplies and services in an efficient and cost-effective manner, both regionally and nationally. Additionally, we are able to share best practices across the organization and leverage our size for administrative support, customer service, accounting, procurement, technical support and engineering.

BUILD AND HOLD SUBSTANTIAL RESERVES: Our reserves are critical to our long-term success. We currently have 15.6 billion tons of proven and probable aggregates reserves. They are strategically located throughout the United States in high-growth areas that are expected to require large amounts of aggregates to meet future construction demand. Moreover, there are significant barriers to entry in many metropolitan markets due to stringent zoning and permitting regulations. These restrictions curtail expansion in certain areas, but they also increase the value of our reserves at existing locations.

2. Growth management AND CAPITAL ALLOCATION 

growth management: Demand for our products is dependent on construction activity and correlates positively with changes in population growth, household formation and employment. As such, we have pursued a strategy to increase our presence in U.S. metropolitan areas that are expected to grow the most rapidly and to divest assets that are no longer considered part of our long-term growth strategy. During the period 2020 - 2030, Moody's Analytics projects that 75% of the U.S. population growth, 72% of household formation and 70% of new jobs will occur in Vulcan-served states. Our coast-to-coast footprint serves 20 of the top 25 highest-growth metropolitan statistical areas in 22 states plus the U.S. Virgin Islands and Washington D.C. The close proximity of our aggregates reserves and our production facilities to this projected population growth creates many opportunities to invest capital in high-return projects.

Since becoming a public company in 1956, Vulcan has principally grown by mergers and acquisitions. In 1999, we acquired CalMat Co., thereby expanding our aggregates operations into California and Arizona and making us one of the nation’s leading producers of asphalt mix. In 2007, we acquired Florida Rock Industries, Inc., expanding our aggregates business in Florida and our aggregates and ready-mixed concrete businesses in other Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states. In 2017, we acquired Aggregates USA, greatly expanding our ability to serve customers in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. In 2021, we acquired U.S. Concrete, enhancing and expanding our aggregates-led business in attractive growing metropolitan areas.

While an aggregates-focused business, we selectively make investments in downstream products that drive local market profitability. Our downstream businesses (asphalt and concrete) use Vulcan-produced aggregates almost exclusively. In 2017, we entered the asphalt market in Tennessee through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and a construction paving business. In 2018, we entered the asphalt mix and construction paving markets in Alabama and expanded our asphalt operations and service offerings in Texas through the acquisition of several asphalt mix operations and construction paving businesses. Through our 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete, we entered the Oklahoma, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and U.S. Virgin Islands concrete markets and expanded our California, Texas and Washington D.C. concrete markets.

Additionally, throughout our history, we have completed many bolt-on aggregates and downstream acquisitions that have contributed significantly to our growth. From 2019 to 2021, we invested over $1,758.1 million in acquisitions as outlined in Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

capital allocation: Our long-term capital allocation strategy is focused on the following priorities:

Operating Capital (maintain and grow the value of our franchise)

Growth Capital (including greenfields and acquisitions)

Dividend Growth (with a keen focus on sustainability)

Return Excess Cash to Shareholders (primarily via share repurchases)

During 2021, we reinvested $451.3 million into core operating & maintenance capital and internal growth capital, in addition to $362.2 million and $384.1 million reinvested in 2020 and 2019, respectively. These investments are fundamental actions that sustain and strengthen the business. They improve the longer-term efficiency, capacity and flexibility of our production, and they support our strong commitment to superior customer service.

As illustrated below, our annual Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) decreased 0.1 percentage points (10 basis points) in 2021. While Adjusted EBITDA increased 10% in 2021 (net earnings attributable to Vulcan increased 15% in 2021), invested capital also increased by 10%, primarily as a result of the U.S. Concrete acquisition. We remain committed to driving improvement in our ROIC through solid operating earnings growth coupled with disciplined capital management.

3. compounding improvement in profitability

Our focus on the following four strategic disciplines has made us one of the most profitable public companies in the industry (as measured by aggregates gross profit per ton).

Operational Excellence — Continuous and sustainable improvements in both our operating disciplines and our industry-leading safety performance coupled with better asset utilization through improved availability and throughput leads to effective cost control.

Strategic Sourcing — Leveraging common practices and innovation leads to more time in our plants and with our suppliers to deliver the right parts and services at the right time and optimize the total cost of ownership.

Commercial Excellence — Clearly defined roles and responsibilities together with access to real time, forward-looking metrics lead to our sales teams spending less time on non-selling activities and more time responding to our customers’ needs.

Logistics Innovation — Partnering with our customers (truck drivers and contractors) to provide a bundled logistics solution with digital shipping records and on-site, mobile visibility leads to streamlined scheduling, speed and accuracy of delivery, and efficient back-office processes.

We manage these disciplines locally and align our talent and incentives accordingly. Our knowledgeable and experienced workforce and our flexible production capabilities allow us to manage operational and overhead costs aggressively. As a result, aggregates gross profit per ton has improved from $5.32 in 2019 to $5.81 in 2021.

4. LAND MANAGEMENT

With more than 240,000 acres in our land portfolio, a long-term holistic approach to preserving land and water is integral to sustaining our success. From pre-mining to mining to reclamation, we are actively managing the entire life cycle of our land, creating maximum value for the business, our shareholders and our communities.

We are putting land to use before we mine by creating opportunities for agriculture and timber development. After mining, our land and water assets will be converted to other valuable uses including drinking water reservoirs, aquifer recharge basins, public parks, habitat mitigation banks, wetlands, productive farmland and residential and commercial developments. In 2021, we sold previously mined land in Southern California that we had reclaimed for commercial and retail development for net proceeds of $182.3 million resulting in a pretax net gain of $114.7 million.

Because of the evolving needs of our communities, we listen to and collaborate with our neighbors to prepare the land for its highest and best use after mining is complete. Our work with state, regional and local governments to develop solutions today will benefit future generations.

5. SAFETY, HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT

A strategy for sustainable, long-term value creation must include doing right by your employees, your neighbors and the environment in which you operate.

Our leadership recognized decades ago the significance and importance of leadership in the Safety, Health and Environmental areas. The Safety, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee of our Board of Directors, along with the full Board, has oversight responsibility for our environmental, safety and health programs and results. Our Safety, Health & Environmental Management Committee, made up of the senior leadership team along with other key senior personnel from cross-functional operations and staff disciplines, has the ongoing management responsibility for all of our safety, health and environmental initiatives. We are a leader in our industry in safety performance by applying the shared experiences, expertise and resources at each of our locally led sites with an emphasis on taking care of one another. In 2021, we achieved an overall Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) safety performance of 0.98 injuries per 200,000 employee hours worked, which is both industry-leading and considered world-class.

Our community relations programs serve our neighbors while ensuring that we grow and thrive in the communities where we operate. We leveraged our charitable foundation and company funds to support food banks, healthcare services, childhood education remote learning programs and other initiatives designed to lessen the difficulties experienced in many of our communities. Our charitable foundation alone has provided more than $60 million in support over the past 20 years to essential charitable, civic and educational organizations that strengthen and enrich our communities.

We focus on our environmental stewardship programs with the same intensity that we bring to our health and safety initiatives. Our environmental stewardship commitment is designed to protect plant and animal species and habitats, as well as the air we breathe, the water we use and the planet we all share. In all parts of our company, from local operations to our corporate and regional offices to our international business and ocean-going shipping, we are focused on ensuring that our operations are efficient in ways that are economically and environmentally sustainable. We are proud to maintain the third largest number of Certified Wildlife Habitat sites of any industrial company in the U.S. for 2021, in partnership with the international Wildlife Habitat Council. For a discussion of our energy management and greenhouse gas emissions initiatives, see the Climate Change section later within this Item 1 under Other Business-Related Items.

PRODUCT LINES

Our products are used to build the roads, tunnels, bridges, railroads and airports that connect us, and to build the hospitals, schools, shopping centers, factories and places of worship that are essential to our lives, our communities and the economy. We have four operating (and reportable) segments (Aggregates, Asphalt, Concrete and Calcium) organized around our principal product lines. As of December 31, 2021, we had 404 active aggregates facilities, 69 asphalt facilities, 173 concrete facilities and 1 calcium facility.

Our 2021 total revenues and gross profit by segment are illustrated as follows (Calcium revenues and gross profit were less than one percent):

For actual amounts, see Note 15 “Segment Reporting” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

We generally ship our products upon receipt of a purchase order or in some cases simply a price quote. Therefore, we do not have a significant order backlog.

1. AGGREGATES

Our construction aggregates are used in a number of ways:

as a base material underneath highways, walkways, airport runways, parking lots and railroads

to aid in water filtration, purification and erosion control

as a raw material used in combination with other resources to construct many of the items we rely on to sustain our quality of life, including:

houses and apartments

roads, bridges and parking lots

schools and hospitals

commercial buildings and retail space

sewer systems

power plants

airports and runways

AGGREGATES INDUSTRY

Factors that affect the U.S. aggregates industry and our business include:

Location and transportation of reserves: Aggregates have a high weight-to-value ratio and, in most cases, must be produced near where they are used; if not, transportation can cost more than the materials, rendering them uncompetitive compared to locally produced materials. Where practical, we have operations located close to our local markets because the cost of trucking materials long distances is prohibitive. Approximately 82% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered exclusively from the producing location to the customer by truck.

Exceptions to this typical market structure include areas along the U.S. Gulf Coast and the Eastern Seaboard where there are limited supplies of locally available, high-quality aggregates. We serve these markets from quarries that have access to cost-effective long-haul transportation — shipping by barge and rail — and from our quarry on Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula with our fleet of Panamax-class, self-unloading ships. Additionally, as a result of our 2021 acquisition of U.S. Concrete, we serve markets in California and Hawaii from our quarry in British Columbia, Canada by means of a long-term marine shipping agreement with CSL Americas. Approximately 17% of our total aggregates shipments are delivered by truck to the customer after reaching a sales yard by rail or water. The remaining 1% of aggregates shipments are delivered directly to the customer by rail or water.

Limited product substitution: There are limited substitutes for quality aggregates. Recycled concrete and asphalt have certain applications as a lower-cost alternative to virgin aggregates. However, many types of construction projects cannot be served by recycled concrete and require the use of virgin aggregates to meet technical specifications and performance-based criteria for durability, strength and other qualities. Likewise, the amount of recycled asphalt included in asphalt mix as a substitute for aggregates is limited due to specifications.

Highly fragmented industry: The U.S. aggregates industry is composed of over 5,500 companies that manage close to 11,000 operations. This fragmented structure provides many opportunities for consolidation. Companies in the industry commonly enter new markets or expand positions in existing markets through the acquisition of existing facilities.

Through strategic acquisitions and investments, we have developed an unmatched coast-to-coast footprint of strategically located permitted reserves concentrated in and serving the nation’s key growth centers. We have over 20,000 customers in 22 states, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Washington D.C., the Bahamas, British Columbia (Canada), and Quintana Roo (Mexico).

Flexible production capabilities: The production of aggregates is a mechanical process in which stone is crushed and, through a series of screens, separated into various sizes depending on how it will be used. Direct production costs of aggregates primarily include: a) wages and fringe benefits; b) depreciation, depletion, accretion and amortization of capital (or long-term) assets; c) operating parts and supplies; d) repair and maintenance; e) outside services and f) energy (primarily electricity and diesel). Production capacity is flexible by adjusting operating hours to meet changing market demand. We are currently operating considerably below full capacity, making us extremely well positioned to further benefit from economies of scale when additional growth materializes.

raw material inputs largely ControlLED: Unlike typical industrial manufacturing industries, the aggregates industry does not require the input of raw material beyond owned or leased aggregates reserves. Stone, sand and gravel are naturally occurring resources. However, production does require the use of explosives, hydrocarbon fuels and electric power.

Demand cycles: Long-term growth in demand for aggregates is largely driven by growth in population, jobs and households. While short-term and medium-term demand for aggregates fluctuates with economic cycles, declines have historically been followed by strong recoveries.

The drivers underpinning long-term demand and sustained pricing growth remain firmly in place in both the public and private sectors of the economy. They include: population growth; gains in total employment (short-term disruption due to COVID-19 pandemic) and in household income and wages; a continuing increase in household formations; the growing need for additional housing stock and housing demand; a multi-year federal transportation law in place and continuing increases in transportation funding at state and local levels; stable state tax receipts; public investment in infrastructure that is still well below the long-term trend-line; and a multi-year federal infrastructure investment law and continued political awareness and focus on the need to invest in infrastructure.

AGGREGATES MARKETS

We focus on the U.S. markets with above-average long-term expected population growth and where construction is expected to expand. Because transportation is a significant part of the delivered cost of aggregates, our facilities are typically located in the markets they serve or have access to economical transportation via rail, barge or ship to a particular end market. We serve both the public and the private sectors.

Public sector construction activity has historically been more stable and less cyclical than privately-funded construction, and it generally requires more aggregates per dollar of construction spending. Private sector construction (primarily residential and nonresidential buildings) typically is more affected by general economic cycles than publicly-funded projects (particularly highways, roads and bridges), which tend to receive more consistent levels of funding throughout economic cycles.

Part I

10

PUBLIC SECTOR CONSTRUCTION MARKET

Public sector construction includes spending by federal, state and local governments for highways, bridges, buildings, airports, schools, prisons, sewer and waste disposal systems, water supply systems, dams, reservoirs and other public construction projects. Construction for power plants and other utilities is funded from both public and private sources. In 2021, publicly-funded construction accounted for approximately 42% of our total aggregates shipments, and approximately 22% of our aggregates sales by volume were used in highway construction projects.

Public Sector Funding: Generally, public sector construction spending is more stable than private sector construction spending; public sector spending is less sensitive to interest rates and has historically been supported by multi-year laws, which provide certainty in funding amounts, program structures, rules and regulations. Federal spending is governed by authorization, budget and appropriations laws. The level of state and local spending on infrastructure varies across the United States and depends on individual state needs and economies.

STATE AND LOCAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDING: Since 2012, 32 states have increased or adjusted taxes on motor fuel to increase revenues available for transportation investment. Most recently, in 2020 the Virginia legislature raised its statewide gas tax, and voters in Arkansas renewed a ½ cent sales tax measure originally approved in 2012, to provide significant revenue for highway construction and maintenance through motor fuel tax increases. Other states have increased revenues outside of fuel taxes or made one-time increases. Since 2012, eleven Vulcan-served states representing 88% of our 2021 total revenues have averaged a 69% increase in their states’ revenues for highways.

Several states also index their gas taxes to a measure of inflation, including Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina.

In addition, we benefit from state and local transportation funding ballot measures. Across the U.S., voters in 17 states approved 87% of 323 measures in 2021, which will generate $7.6 billion in new and recurring transportation investment. This continues a trend in which voters have approved 84% of 2,608 transportation investment ballot measures since 2010. Major transportation funding measures in Vulcan-served areas approved in 2021 are estimated to result in $3.3 billion in revenues and bond proceeds primarily dedicated to roads, streets and bridges.

federal highway funding: In November 2021, President Biden signed a historic, bi-partisan infrastructure bill, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), into law.

The IIJA provides the largest increase in federal highway, road and bridge funding in more than six decades with a five-year reauthorization of Federal-Aid Highway Program funding. The total Federal-Aid Highway Program obligation limitation under IIJA starts at $66.9 billion in FFY 2022 and increases to $72.1 billion in FFY 2026, for a total of nearly $350 billion.

These numbers include one-time additional funding for large road and bridge projects, such as $40 billion for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation. Of the bridge money, approximately $16.5 billion is earmarked for projects in Vulcan-served states.

The long-term nature of the highway program reauthorization in the IIJA is important. The Federal-Aid Highway Program is the largest component of the law and has provided, on average, 50% of all state capital investment in roads and bridges over the last 10 years. This multi-year authorization and the associated dedicated funding provides state departments of transportation with the ability to plan and execute long-range, complex highway projects. In states where we operate, we are well positioned to serve the large general contractors who will compete for new freight and other major capacity projects that will move forward with IIJA and policy implementation.

Importantly, building on improvements in the two prior reauthorization laws — The Fixing America’s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act) and Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) — the IIJA further streamlines project delivery and environmental approval advancements.

Project financing remains an important additional component of overall surface transportation spending. The IIJA expands access to private activity bonds for highway and intermodal projects, and sets the Transportation Infrastructure Finance & Innovation Act (TIFIA) program authorized at $250 million per year. 

Part I

11

ADDITIONAL FEDERAL INFRASTUCTURE INVESTMENTS UNDER THE IIJA: The IIJA allocates a total of approximately $1.2 trillion in federal funds for infrastructure investment, including almost $550 billion in new spending. A little more than half of the new money is dedicated to transportation sector projects. Beyond highway infrastructure, Vulcan could benefit from IIJA-funded, aggregates-intensive infrastructure projects, such as railroads, airports, seaports, and drinking and wastewater systems.

FEDERAL WATER Resources INFRASTRUCTURE: In December 2020, President Trump signed the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (WRDA 2020) into law, enacting the fourth consecutive biennial authorization for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Army Corps) since 2014. WRDA 2020 reauthorizes needed investment in America’s ports, channels, locks, dams, and other infrastructure that supports the maritime and waterways transportation system and provides flood protection for communities. It also improves the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) programs for storm water, water recycling, and sewer overflow projects. The FFY 2021 appropriations for the Army Corps, also passed as part of the year-end legislative package, funds for the first time the Army Corps Water Infrastructure Financing Program (CWIFP), which was authorized in the Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014). Modeled after the highly popular TIFIA program in the surface transportation sector, CWIFP will accelerate non-federal investments in water resources infrastructure by providing long-term, low-cost loans to creditworthy borrowers.

Private sector CONSTRUCTION MARKET

The private sector construction markets include both nonresidential building construction and residential construction and are considerably more cyclical than public construction. In 2021, privately-funded construction accounted for approximately 58% of our total aggregates shipments.

Nonresidential Construction: Private nonresidential building construction includes a wide array of projects. Such projects generally are more aggregates intensive than residential construction. Overall demand in private nonresidential construction generally is driven by job growth, vacancy rates, private infrastructure needs and demographic trends. The growth of the private workforce creates demand for offices, hotels and restaurants. Likewise, population growth generates demand for stores, shopping centers, warehouses and parking decks as well as hospitals, places of worship and entertainment facilities. Large industrial projects, such as a new manufacturing facility, can increase the need for other manufacturing plants to supply parts and assemblies. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by a firm's ability to finance a project and the cost of such financing. This end market also includes capital investments in public nonresidential facilities to meet the needs of a growing population.

Residential Construction: Household formations in Vulcan-served states continue to outpace household formations in the rest of the United States. The majority of residential construction is for single-family housing with the remainder consisting of multi-family construction (i.e., two family houses, apartment buildings and condominiums). Public housing comprises only a small portion of housing demand. Construction activity in this end market is influenced by the cost and availability of mortgage financing and builders’ ability to maintain skilled labor.

U.S. housing starts, as measured by Dodge Data & Analytics data, peaked in early 2006 at over 2 million units annually. By the end of 2009, total housing starts had declined to less than 0.6 million units, well below prior historical lows of approximately 1 million units annually. In 2021, total annual housing starts in the U.S. reached 1.75 million units.

ADDITIONAL AGGREGATES PRODUCTS AND MARKETS

We sell aggregates that are used as ballast for construction and maintenance of railroad tracks. We also sell riprap and jetty stone for erosion control along roads and waterways. In addition, stone can be used as a feedstock for cement and lime plants and for making a variety of adhesives, fillers and extenders. Coal-burning power plants use limestone in scrubbers to reduce harmful emissions. Limestone that is crushed to a fine powder can be sold as agricultural lime.

We sell a relatively small amount of construction aggregates outside of the United States, principally in the areas surrounding our large quarry on the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico and our quarry in British Columbia, Canada. Nondomestic sales and long-lived assets outside the United States are reported in Note 15 “Segment Reporting” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

VERTICAL INTEGRATION

While aggregates is our focus and primary business, we believe vertical integration between aggregates and downstream products, such as asphalt mix and ready-mixed concrete, can be managed effectively in certain markets to generate attractive financial returns and enhance financial returns in our core Aggregates segment. We produce and sell asphalt mix and/or ready-mixed concrete within each of our three geographic markets, as noted below. We also provide construction paving services (included in our Asphalt segment) in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas. 

Aggregates comprise approximately 95% of asphalt mix by weight and 80% of ready-mixed concrete by weight. In both of these downstream businesses, aggregates are primarily supplied from our operations.

Part I

2. ASPHALT

We produce and sell asphalt mix in Alabama, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Tennessee and Texas. In October 2020, we strengthened our asphalt position in Texas by acquiring additional asphalt operations. For additional details, see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Aggregates are a major component in asphalt mix, comprising approximately 95% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements for our Asphalt segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Because asphalt mix hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. The asphalt mix production process requires liquid asphalt cement, which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Asphalt segment customers directly from our local production facilities. 

3. CONCRETE

We produce and sell ready-mixed concrete in California, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Washington D.C. In August 2021, through our acquisition of U.S. Concrete, we entered the New Jersey, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania and U.S. Virgin Islands concrete markets and expanded our service of the California, Texas and Washington D.C. concrete markets. In April 2020, we exited the New Mexico ready-mixed concrete market (we retained the concrete plants and mobile fleet which are leased to the buyer and obtained a 20-year aggregates supply agreement). In October 2019, we expanded our ready-mixed concrete operations in Virginia via an acquisition. For additional details see Note 19 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

This segment relies on our reserves of aggregates, functioning essentially as a customer to our aggregates operations. Ready-mixed concrete consists of cement and other cement-related materials (such as fly ash and slag), aggregates (crushed stone and sand), chemical admixtures and water and is measured in cubic yards. Aggregates are a major component in ready-mixed concrete, comprising approximately 80% by weight of this product. We meet the aggregates requirements of our Concrete segment primarily through our Aggregates segment. These product transfers are made at local market prices for the particular grade and quality of material required.

Cement is the binding agent used to bind water, crushed stone and sand in the production of ready-mixed concrete. Other industrial byproducts, such as fly ash from coal burning power plants and slag from the manufacture of iron and silica fume, have cement-related properties that allow them to be used as substitutes for cement depending on the specifications. We purchase cement-related materials from a few suppliers in each of our major geographic markets. Chemical admixtures are generally purchased from suppliers under national purchasing agreements.

With the exception of chemical admixtures, each ready-mix facility typically maintains an inventory level of these raw materials sufficient to satisfy its operating needs for a few days. Inventory levels do not decline significantly or comparatively with declines in revenue during seasonally lower periods. We generally maintain inventory at specified levels to maximize purchasing efficiencies and to be able to respond quickly to customer demand.

Because ready-mixed concrete hardens rapidly, delivery typically is within close proximity to the producing facility. Ready-mixed concrete production also requires cement which we purchase from third-party producers. We do not anticipate any significant difficulties in obtaining the raw materials necessary for this segment to operate. We serve our Concrete segment customers from our local production facilities or by truck.

4. CALCIUM

Our Calcium segment is composed of a single calcium operation in Brooksville, Florida. This facility produces calcium products for the animal feed, plastics and water treatment industries with high-quality calcium carbonate material mined at the Brooksville quarry.

OTHER BUSINESS-RELATED ITEMS

SEASONALITY AND CYCLICAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

Almost all of our products are produced and consumed outdoors. Seasonal changes and other weather-related conditions can affect the production and sales volumes of our products. Therefore, the financial results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for the year. Normally, the highest sales and earnings are in the third quarter and the lowest are in the first quarter. Furthermore, our sales and earnings are sensitive to national, regional and local economic conditions, demographic and population fluctuations, and particularly to cyclical swings in construction spending, primarily in the private sector.

COMPETITORS

We operate in a fragmented industry with a large number of small, privately-held companies. We estimate that the ten largest aggregates producers accounted for 33% of the total U.S. aggregates production in 2021. Despite being the industry leader, Vulcan’s total U.S. market share is less than 10% (exclusive of our recent U.S. Concrete acquisition). Other publicly traded companies among the ten largest U.S. aggregates producers include the following:

Arcosa, Inc.

Cemex S.A.B. de C.V.

CRH plc 

HeidelbergCement AG

Holcim

Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

Summit Materials, Inc.

Because the U.S. aggregates industry is highly fragmented, with over 5,500 companies managing close to 11,000 operations during 2021, many opportunities for consolidation exist. Therefore, companies in the industry tend to grow by acquiring existing facilities to enter new markets or extend their existing market positions.

CUSTOMERS

No material part of our business depends upon any single customer whose loss would have a significant adverse effect on our business. In 2021, our five largest customers accounted for 8% of our total revenues, and no single customer accounted for more than 2% of our total revenues. Although approximately 45% to 55% of our aggregates shipments have historically been used in publicly-funded construction, such as highways, airports and government buildings, a relatively small portion of our sales are made directly to federal, state, county or municipal governments/agencies. Therefore, although reductions in state and federal funding can curtail publicly-funded construction, the vast majority of our business is not directly subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts with local, state or federal governments. In addition, our sales to government entities span several hundred entities coast-to-coast, ensuring that negative changes to various government budgets would have a muted impact across such a diversified set of government customers.

CLIMATE CHANGE 

Climate change, or long-term changes in global temperature and other characteristics of the atmosphere, is a global concern. Impacts of climate change are seen in the forms of increased global temperatures and more frequent and intense droughts, heat waves, wildfires and storms, which can destroy habitats, affect livelihoods and communities, and disrupt the economy. These severe impacts have been felt across our footprint as exemplified by the recent drought, wildfires and flooding in California; the number and severity of hurricanes in our Gulf Coast states; and flooding in our mid-Atlantic states.

The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow (COP26) stressed the urgency of taking action to keep global temperature from exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Due to human influence on the climate from carbon-based energy use and unsustainable natural resource management, the Earth is now about 1.1 degrees Celsius warmer than it was in the 1800s.

Vulcan’s carbon footprint is small: in 2021, our total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were 1.1 million tons of CO2e. On a per-operation basis, our industrial operations are well below the EPA’s threshold for reporting and permitting of GHG emissions. Even with this small footprint, beginning in 2018, Vulcan chose to report GHG emissions via the Carbon Disclosure Project. In 2022, we will establish goals and targets related to Scope 1 and 2 emissions and will calculate our Scope 3 emissions, which result from activities of assets not owned or controlled by Vulcan but that we indirectly impact in our value chain. We intend to disclose science-based targets aligned with holding warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in 2023.

As an industry leader, we are committed to doing our part to strengthen the sustainability of our products and operations and to reduce our impact on the environment through initiatives that favorably impact climate change, such as: managing energy and operational efficiency to reduce GHG emissions and recycling.

MANAGING ENERGY AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS: Environmental stewardship — including our efforts to manage energy and increase efficiencies — is embedded into our business strategy and culture. Energy management, operational efficiency and the purchase of renewable energy have reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions per ton of production and per dollar of revenue compared to 2015, as noted below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1

We exited the cement business in 2014. Therefore, we use 2015 as the baseline for measuring GHG emission over time in order to provide a more accurate measure of our progress. 

We manage energy use carefully. We routinely conduct energy audits of our operations to identify areas for operational efficiency improvements and energy savings. Some of the opportunities identified during these audits that are being implemented include: replacement of older motors with new ultra-high efficiency motors to power plant processing equipment; improvements in water handling systems to reduce water pumping needed; optimizing process equipment flow to maximize efficiency; use of LED lighting; and optimization of air conditioning and lighting control to reduce energy consumption.

We continue to increase the fuel efficiencies of our off-road fleet vehicles. Tier IV machines performed over 50% of the off-road fleet’s work in 2021, which positively impacts all air emissions in addition to having an impact on GHG emissions.

Additionally, our Concrete segment has licensed the CarbonCure technology that provides capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide within ready-mixed concrete. The carbon dioxide becomes chemically bound within the concrete matrix and is not released into the air, even when the concrete is recycled following use. This technology also reduces the demand for cement and other cement-related materials which reduces the supply side carbon footprint. The resulting concrete is also stronger than it would have been without use of the technology. 

Part I

16

We are actively assessing the scope and scale of potential opportunities to reduce future GHG emissions. Future Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions will come by means of continuing heavy equipment replacement with higher efficiency models, seeking production efficiencies and procuring energy from renewable sources.

We are confident that there are many more opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint of our operations, distribution and transport networks, and the projects in which our products are used. An example of an additional opportunity that we are exploring is the installation of battery storage for electricity at multiple locations so that energy can be stored during off peak periods to run the plant equipment, thereby minimizing peak load usage. This has significant implications for the ability of the utility company to meet peak demands and to reduce their use of older power plants that burn coal or oil and emit greater concentrations of GHG emissions.

RECYCLING: Ensuring proper management of waste materials to prevent the release of contaminants to the environment is good environmental stewardship and good risk management. Recycling of certain items also reduces our impact on climate change. Since 2017, we have recycled more than 1.9 million gallons of used oil (including 0.4 million gallons in 2021) resulting in both a cost savings to us and a reduction in the amount of new fossil fuels required.

The recycling of aggregates-containing construction materials including concrete and recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) is an important part of our business. The sources of these materials are highway and infrastructure projects and other demolition projects where concrete structures or asphalt paving is being removed. 

RAP is used as a supplemental feedstock for the asphalt plants as it provides quality aggregates and valuable heat content (from asphaltic cement) to replace some of the virgin aggregates and asphaltic cement (asphalt oil) that would otherwise be used — during 2021, we reused 1.7 million tons of RAP.

Concrete is reprocessed through crushing and screening plants to produce aggregates-containing recycled concrete products — during 2021, we recycled 2.4 million tons of concrete.

The recycling of these aggregates-containing construction materials reduces carbon emissions that impact climate change while providing a valuable service to our customers and communities, extending the life of our aggregates reserves and helping us manage the cost of production.

ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

We are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations in the communities where we conduct business. Compliance with these laws and regulations often requires the time and effort of our employees, as well as financial resources. The following describes certain significant regulations that may impact our business. For additional information about our risks related to government regulations, see Item 1A “Risk Factors.”

Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety; including regulation of facility air emissions and water discharges, waste management, protection of wetlands, listed and threatened species, noise and dust exposure control for workers, and safety regulations under both Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Compliance with these various regulations requires capital investment and ongoing expenditures for the operation and maintenance of systems and implementation of programs. These anticipated investments and expenditures are not material to our earnings or competitive position.

We have received notices from the EPA or similar state or local agencies that we are considered a potentially responsible party (PRP) at a limited number of sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) or similar state and local environmental laws. Generally, we share the cost of remediation at these sites with other PRPs or alleged PRPs in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations. There is inherent uncertainty in determining the potential cost of remediating a given site and in determining any individual party's share of that cost. As a result, estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes available about the nature or extent of site contamination, remediation methods, other PRPs and their probable level of involvement, and actions by or against governmental agencies or private parties. 

Part I

17

Frequently, we are required by state and local regulations or contractual obligations to reclaim our former mining sites. These reclamation liabilities are recorded at fair value in our financial statements at the time the obligation arises. To determine the fair value, we estimate the cost for a third party to perform the legally required reclamation, which is adjusted for inflation and risk and includes a reasonable profit margin. Reclaimed quarries often have potential for use in commercial or residential development or as reservoirs or landfills. However, no projected cash flows from these anticipated uses have been considered to offset or reduce the estimated reclamation liability.

For additional information about environmental matters and reclamation obligations, see Notes 12 and 17, respectively, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

HUMAN CAPITAL

As of January 1, 2022, we employed 11,437 people in the United States. Of these employees, 1,602 are represented by labor unions. Also, as of that date, we employed 401 people in Mexico, 73 people in Canada and 1 person in the Bahamas, and of these employees, 325 are represented by labor unions. We have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage in the past 10 years, and we do not anticipate any significant issues with any unions in 2022.

Vulcan’s commitment to our people has played a key role in the ongoing success and growth of our company throughout our long history. We are dedicated to fostering a culture of mutual respect, integrity, teamwork and trust among our workforce. Our people share a competitive drive to be the best they can be and do the right thing, which benefits all our stakeholders.

Diversity and inclusion are important values at Vulcan. Our continued investment in people and strong commitment to diversity and inclusion will help us attract, grow and retain the best talent possible. In 2015, we escalated and formalized our efforts in this area with the launch of our Diversity and Inclusion Council to promote an open workplace where everyone, regardless of background, race, or other factors, is free to contribute and grow. In 2019, we signed the CEO Action for Diversity & InclusionTM pledge, and we forged a long-term partnership with Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to support our future leaders in our communities and on our team. In 2020, we established diversity and inclusion (D&I) councils in our divisions to support targeted D&I opportunities in their local communities. In 2021, we launched Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and included quarterly D&I topics and updates in our Vulcan University Pop-Up Training Series.

Diversity and inclusion is also part of employee training. All employees completed D&I awareness training in 2016; all new hires complete D&I awareness training within their first 90 days. The unconscious bias training launched in 2021 will be completed by all employees by the end of 2022.

As a result of our commitment to diversity and inclusion we have:

Cultivated a diverse talent pipeline of next generation leaders through our operations/sales trainee program

Expanded the diversity of our workforce at middle management and higher levels

Increased the number of female hires and promotions in senior leadership roles

Developed a five-year strategy through our Diversity and Inclusion Council

Built partnerships with HBCUs to recruit talented minority students for internships and management training roles

Our Board of Directors is 36% diverse (three board members are women and one board member is Black); and, we earned recognition in 2017 by 2020 Women on Boards for having 20% or more of our board seats held by women.

We believe that learning is fundamental to every job, and we encourage our people to expand and explore their capabilities for continued growth. Our industry-leading training and development programs encourage collaboration and enable people to innovate and flourish on the job and in the community. These programs:

Provide our employees with a Tuition Reimbursement Program, which pays up to 100% of tuition costs based on academic performance

Encourage personal and professional growth through our mentoring program, which has graduated more than 1,906 employees

Prepare future senior-level leaders through our Leadership 2022 series in partnership with the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 

Offer mini MBA programs and other continuing education opportunities

ITEM 1A 

RISK FACTORS

The following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

ECONOMIC/POLITICAL RISKS

Our business is dependent on the construction industry and is subject to economic cycles — Our products are principally sold to the U.S. construction industry. Because our business is dependent on spending in both the public and private sector construction markets, our profits are sensitive to the underlying national, regional, and local economic conditions. Construction spending, which is cyclical, is affected by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates, demographic shifts, industry cycles, employment levels, inflation and other business, economic and financial factors that are beyond our control. A downturn in construction activities or spending in Vulcan-served markets, particularly in our top revenue-generating markets, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

A pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency, such as the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows — Our operations expose us to risks associated with pandemics, epidemics or other public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This pandemic has resulted in governments around the world implementing or reimplementing strict measures to help control the spread of the virus, including quarantines, “shelter in place” and “stay at home” orders, travel restrictions, business curtailments, school closures, and other measures. In addition, governments and central banks in several parts of the world have enacted fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to counteract the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further action as circumstances warrant.

Consistent with federal guidelines and with state and local orders to date, we currently continue to operate across our footprint. Notwithstanding our continued operations and an economic environment that has shown signs of improvement, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may have further negative impacts on our operations, supply chain, transportation networks and customers, which may lower our revenues and EBITDA, including as a result of preventative and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. The COVID-19 pandemic is a widespread public health crisis that is adversely affecting the economies and financial markets of many countries. Any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and contribute to volatile supply and demand conditions affecting prices and volumes in the markets for our products and services. The progression of this matter has and may continue to negatively impact our business or results of operations by affecting the health of our employees and through the temporary closure of our operating locations or those of our customers or suppliers. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows will depend on future developments, which remain highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and geographic spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact including the reimplementation of restrictions on economic activity following new outbreaks, the availability, durability and efficacy of vaccines, the long-term impacts of the virus on transportation revenues, government budgets and other funding priorities and the extent and pace at which normal economic and operating conditions can resume. There can be no assurance that we will not be impacted by adverse consequences that may be brought about by pandemics on global financial markets, which may reduce resources, share prices and financial liquidity and may severely limit the availability of financing capital. 

Part I

22

Changes in legal requirements and governmental policies concerning zoning, land use, environmental and other areas of the law may result in additional liabilities, a reduction in operating hours and additional capital expenditures — Our operations are affected by numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to zoning, land use and environmental matters. Despite our compliance efforts, we have an inherent risk of liability in the operation of our business. These potential liabilities could have an adverse impact on our operations and profitability. In addition, our operations require numerous governmental approvals and permits, which often require us to make significant capital and operating expenditures to comply with the applicable requirements. Stricter laws and regulations, or more stringent interpretations of existing laws or regulations, may impose new liabilities, taxes or tariffs on us; reduce operating hours; require additional investment by us in pollution control equipment; create restrictions on our products; impede our access to reserves or hamper the opening of new or expansion of existing plants or facilities.

Our business is dependent on the timing and amount of federal, state and local funding for infrastructure — Our products are used in a variety of public infrastructure projects that are funded and financed by federal, state and local governments. In 2021, voters in local jurisdictions in Arizona, Georgia, Texas and Virginia, among others, approved bond and revenue-raising measures to provide additional resources for transportation projects. In 2020, Virginia passed new long-term highway funding legislation and voters in Arkansas made permanent a ½ cent gas tax increase first approved in 2012. In November 2021, the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA), which included a five year road, bridge and public transportation program reauthorization at record levels, was signed into law. The highway programs, as well as funding for other aggregates-intensive public infrastructure, will provide assistance to state departments of transportation, federal, state and local agencies, and metro areas for several years to come. However, given the time to set up new federal programs, varying state and local budgetary situations and the stages of projects, we cannot be entirely assured of the existence, amount and timing of appropriations for future public infrastructure projects.

Climate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely impact our business — A number of governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating legislative and regulatory change in response to the potential impacts of climate change. Such legislation or regulation, if enacted, potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax, among other provisions. 

Other potential impacts of climate change include physical impacts, such as disruption in production and product distribution due to impacts from major storm events, shifts in regional weather patterns and intensities, availability of water and potential impacts from sea level changes. There is also a potential for climate change legislation and regulation to adversely impact the cost of purchased energy and electricity. A number of our facilities are located in desert climates, and while we have not experienced any significant shortages of energy or water in the past, we cannot guarantee that we will not in the future. Furthermore, public expectations for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment.

The impacts of climate change on our operations and the company overall are highly uncertain and difficult to estimate. However, climate change legislation and regulation concerning greenhouse gases could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

We are subject to various risks arising from our international business operations and relationships, which could adversely affect our business — We have international operations and are subject to both the risks of conducting international business and the requirements of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the FCPA). We face political and other risks, including legal risks for failure to comply with the FCPA, associated with our international operations, including our largest aggregates production facility located in Playa del Carmen, Mexico and our newly acquired aggregates production facility in British Columbia, Canada. These risks have included and may in the future include changes in international trade policies, such as the United States - Mexico - Canada Agreement (USMCA), imposition of duties, taxes or government royalties, arbitrary changes to permits, zoning classifications or operating agreements, or overt acts by foreign governments, including expropriations and other forms of takings of property. Recently, the Mexican government has taken actions that adversely affect our operations in that country, including delays in issuing a historically routine three-year customs permit for our deep-water port. Mexico instead issued a short-term customs permit that must be renewed after two months. While we continue to negotiate with the Mexican authorities to reach an agreeable and mutually beneficial solution, failure by the Mexican government to issue future customs permits or its taking of any other measures that force us to cease our operations in Mexico would have an adverse effect on our ability to supply customers.

GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE RISKS

Within our local markets, we operate in a highly competitive industry which may negatively impact prices, volumes and costs — The construction aggregates industry is highly fragmented with a large number of independent local producers in a number of our markets. Additionally, in most markets, we also compete against large private and public companies, some of which are significantly vertically integrated. Therefore, there is intense competition in a number of markets in which we operate. This significant competition could lead to lower prices and lower sales volumes in some markets, negatively affecting our earnings and cash flows.

The expanded use of aggregates substitutes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations — Recycled concrete and asphalt are increasingly being used in a number of our markets, particularly urban markets, as a substitute for aggregates. The expanded use of recycled concrete and asphalt could cause a significant reduction in the demand for aggregates.

Our long-term success depends upon securing and permitting aggregates reserves in strategically located areas. If we are unable to secure and permit such reserves it could negatively affect our future earnings — Construction aggregates are bulky and heavy and, therefore, difficult to transport efficiently. Because of the nature of the products, the freight costs can quickly surpass the production costs. Therefore, except for geographic regions that do not possess commercially viable deposits of aggregates and are served by rail, barge or ship, the markets for our products tend to be localized around our quarry sites and are served by truck. New quarry sites often take years to develop; therefore, our strategic planning and new site development must stay ahead of actual growth. Additionally, in a number of urban and suburban areas in which we operate, it is increasingly difficult to permit new sites or expand existing sites due to community resistance. Therefore, our future success is dependent, in part, on our ability to accurately forecast future areas of high growth in order to locate optimal facility sites and on our ability to secure operating and environmental permits to operate at those sites.

Our future growth depends in part on acquiring other businesses in our industry and successfully integrating them with our existing operations. If we are unable to integrate acquisitions successfully, it could lead to higher costs and could negatively affect our earnings — The expansion of our business is dependent in part on the acquisition of existing businesses that own or control aggregates reserves. Disruptions in the availability of financing could make it more difficult to capitalize on potential acquisitions. Additionally, with regard to the acquisitions we are able to complete, our future results will depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate these businesses with our existing operations.

FINANCIAL/ACCOUNTING RISKS

Our industry is capital intensive, resulting in significant fixed and semi-fixed costs. Therefore, our earnings are highly sensitive to changes in product shipment volumes — Due to the high levels of fixed capital required for extracting and producing construction aggregates, our profits are negatively affected by significant decreases in shipment volumes.

Significant downturn in the construction industry may result in an impairment of our goodwill — We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances change in a manner that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. While we have not identified any events or changes in circumstances since our annual impairment test on November 1, 2021 that indicate the fair value of any of our reporting units is below its carrying value, a significant downturn in the construction industry may have a material effect on the fair value of our reporting units. A significant decrease in the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units could result in the recognition of a material, noncash write-down of goodwill.

A deterioration in our credit ratings and/or the state of the capital markets could negatively impact the cost and/or availability of financing — We currently have $3.95 billion of debt with maturities between 2022 and 2048. We expect to finance acquisitions with a combination of cash flows from existing operations, additional debt and/or additional equity. The mix of financing sources for acquisitions will be situationally dependent.

A deterioration in our credit ratings, regardless of the cause, could limit our debt financing options and increase the cost of such debt financing. While we do not anticipate a credit ratings downgrade, and plan to manage our capital structure consistent with investment-grade credit metrics, we cannot assure our current credit ratings.

A deterioration in the state of the capital markets, regardless of our credit ratings, could impact our access to and cost of, new debt or equity capital. 

Part I

24

We use estimates in accounting for a number of significant items. Changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results — As discussed more fully in “Critical Accounting Policies” under Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” we use significant judgment in accounting for:

goodwill impairment

impairment of long-lived assets excluding goodwill

business combinations and purchase price allocation

pension and other postretirement benefits

environmental compliance costs

claims and litigation including self-insurance

income taxes

These assumptions and estimates could change significantly in the future and could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

An increase in our effective tax rate could negatively affect our earnings and net cash provided by operating activities — Factors that may increase our future effective tax rate include, but are not limited to: governmental authorities increasing statutory income tax rates or eliminating deductions or credits; the mix of jurisdictions in which our earnings are taxed; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; the effect our stock price has with regard to excess tax benefits from share-based compensation; adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various income tax returns; the resolution of issues arising from income tax audits with various tax authorities; and the interpretation of income tax laws and/or administrative practices.

PERSONNEL RISKS

Our future success greatly depends upon attracting and retaining qualified personnel, particularly in sales and operations — A significant factor in our future profitability is our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified personnel. Our success in attracting qualified personnel, particularly in the areas of sales and operations, is affected by changing demographics of the available pool of workers with the training and skills necessary to fill the available positions, the impact on the labor supply due to general economic conditions, and our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefit packages.

Disputes with organized labor could disrupt our business operations — Labor unions represent approximately 16% of our workforce. Disputes with our trade unions, or the inability to renew our labor agreements, may lead to strikes or other actions that could disrupt our business operations leading to higher costs and/or reduced revenues.

GENERAL RISK FACTORS

A significant interruption of our information technology systems (our own and that of our service providers such as Amazon Web Services) or the loss of confidential or other sensitive data (whether our own, our employees’, our suppliers’, or our customers’) could have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial results — We have a dedicated information security team that executes, and updates as warranted based on emerging risk and new risk management technology, our information security program. The Audit Committee, which has oversight responsibility for our information security program, is briefed on such program at least twice annually, and our Chief Financial Officer is briefed on such program at least quarterly. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology and routinely test the security of our information systems network, we cannot be assured that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our business.

Weather can materially affect our operating results — Almost all of our products are consumed outdoors in the public or private construction industry, and our production and distribution facilities are located outdoors. Inclement weather affects both our ability to produce and distribute our products and affects our customers’ short-term demand because their work also can be hampered by weather.  

Part I

25

Our products are transported by truck, rail, barge or ship, often by third-party providers. Significant delays or increased costs affecting these transportation methods could materially affect our operations and earnings — Our products are distributed either by truck to local markets or by rail, barge or oceangoing vessel to remote markets. The costs of transporting our products could be negatively affected by factors outside of our control, including rail service interruptions or rate increases, tariffs, rising fuel costs, truck/railcar/barge shortages, truck driver and rail crew shortages, capacity constraints and minimum tonnage requirements. Additionally, inclement weather, including hurricanes, tornadoes and other weather events, can negatively impact our distribution network.

We use large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources that are subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect our operating results and profitability — In our production and distribution processes, we consume significant amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces that are beyond our control. Our suppliers contract separately for the purchase of such resources, and our sources of supply could be interrupted should our suppliers not be able to obtain these materials due to higher demand or other factors that interrupt their availability. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could materially affect our operating results from period to period, and rising costs could erode our profitability.

Aggregates resources and reserves calculations are estimates only and are subject to uncertainty due to factors including the inherent variability of the deposit and recoverability of saleable material in the mining process — The calculation of mineral resources and reserves are estimates and depend upon geological interpretation and statistical inferences or assumptions drawn from drilling and sampling analysis, which may prove to be unpredictable. Until mineral reserves are actually mined and processed, the quantity must be considered as an estimate only.

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty — We are involved in several complex litigation proceedings, some arising from our previous ownership and operation of a Chemicals business. Although we divested the Chemicals business in June 2005, we retained certain liabilities related to the business. As required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of a loss contingency and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant legal proceedings see Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Our construction paving business may subject us to contractually imposed penalties or lost profits — We operate construction paving businesses in Alabama, Tennessee and Texas. In some instances, including many of our fixed price paving contracts, we agree to complete a project by a certain date. If we fail to complete the project as scheduled, we may be held responsible for costs resulting from the delay. Consequently, the total project cost could exceed our original estimate, and we could experience reduced profits or even a loss on the project.

We are involved in certain environmental matters. We cannot predict the outcome of these contingencies with certainty — We are involved in environmental investigations and cleanups at sites that we own or owned, where we operate or have operated or where we sent materials for recycling or disposal, as well as related offsite investigations and cleanups. As required by GAAP, we establish reserves when a loss is determined to be probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Our assessment of probability and loss estimates are based on the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments related to these matters may affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingency, and could result in an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a description of our current significant environmental matters see Note 12 “Commitments and Contingencies” in Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
