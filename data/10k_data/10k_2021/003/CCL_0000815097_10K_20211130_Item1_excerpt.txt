PART I

Item 1. Business. 

 A. Overview

I.Summary

Carnival Corporation was incorporated in Panama in 1974 and Carnival plc was incorporated in England and Wales in 2000. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate a dual listed company (“DLC”), whereby the businesses of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are combined through a number of contracts and through provisions in Carnival Corporation’s Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws and Carnival plc’s Articles of Association. The two companies operate as if they are a single economic enterprise with a single senior executive management team and identical Boards of Directors, but each has retained its separate legal identity. Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are both public companies with separate stock exchange listings and their own shareholders. Together with their consolidated subsidiaries, Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc are referred to collectively in this Form 10-K as “Carnival Corporation & plc,” “our,” “us” and “we.” We are one of the world’s largest leisure travel companies with operations in North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. 

 II. Recent Developments

Resumption of Guest Cruise Operations

In the face of the global impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in mid-March 2020. As of January 13, 2022, eight of our nine brands, or 67% of capacity, had resumed guest cruise operations as part of our gradual return to service. We expect to have our full fleet back in operation for our summer season where we historically generate the largest share of our operating income. Since the beginning of our fiscal year, we have experienced an impact on bookings for our near-term sailings, including higher cancellations resulting from an increase in pre-travel positive test results and challenges in the availability of timely pre-travel tests. In addition, in the last few weeks we have seen a dampening of the booking activity for the second half of 2022 relative to 2019. Despite the disruption caused by Omicron to the airlines and other forms of travel, we expect to be able to successfully operate over 96% of our previously disclosed available lower berth days (“ALBD’s”) in the first quarter of 2022.

We have worked closely with health and medical experts globally and nationally, as well as with authorities in

destination countries, to put in place comprehensive health and safety protocols for protection against and mitigation of

COVID-19 across the entire cruise experience for all of our nine brands. This includes cross-industry learnings and

best practices based on the proven health and safety record of industry-wide sailings, and input from top scientists and public

health, epidemiological and policy experts. Protocols have been and will continue to be updated based on evolving scientific

and medical knowledge related to mitigation strategies. Details about enhanced protocols, including the latest information and

requirements for each of our brands, is available on their websites.

Liquidity and Refinancing

We have taken actions to improve our liquidity, including completing various capital market transactions, capital and operating expense reductions during the pause in operations and accelerating the removal of certain less efficient ships from our fleet. As of November 30, 2021, we had $9.4 billion of liquidity including cash, short-term investments and borrowings available under our multi-currency revolving credit facility. Through our debt management efforts, we have refinanced over $9 billion to date, reducing our future annual interest expense by approximately $400 million per year and extending maturities, optimizing our debt maturity profile. In addition, we expect to continue to pursue additional refinancing opportunities to reduce interest expense and extend maturities.

Refer to Note 1 - “Liquidity and Management’s Plans”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates - Liquidity and COVID-19” and to “Liquidity, Financial Condition and Capital Resources” for additional discussion regarding our liquidity.

III. Vision, Goals and Related Strategies 

At Carnival Corporation & plc, our highest responsibility and top priority is compliance, environmental protection and the health, safety and well-being of our guests, the people in the communities we touch and serve, and our shipboard and shoreside employees. On this foundation, we aspire to deliver unmatched joyful vacations for our guests, always exceeding their

expectations and in doing so driving outstanding shareholder value. We are committed to a positive and just corporate culture, based on inclusion and the power of diversity. We operate with integrity, trust and respect for each other -- communicating, coordinating and collaborating while seeking candor, openness and transparency at all times. And we aspire to be an exemplary corporate citizen, leaving the people and the places we touch even better. 

Our vision is based on four key pillars that are all paramount to the success of our business: 

•Compliance, health, environment, safety, security (“HESS”) and sustainability 

•Guests 

•Employees 

•Investors and other stakeholders 

Compliance, HESS and Sustainability

We are committed to operating a safe and reliable fleet and to protect the environment and the health, safety and well-being of our guests, the people in the communities we touch and our shipboard and shoreside employees. We are dedicated to fully complying with, or exceeding, all applicable legal and statutory requirements. We are also focused on enhancing our sustainable business model while reinforcing our commitment to and investment in sustainability solutions through our six critical sustainability focus areas - climate action; circular economy; good health and well-being; sustainable tourism; biodiversity and conservation; and diversity, equity and inclusion. In order to continue supporting our sustainability strategy across our brands and business partners, we have established new goals for 2030 and aspirations for 2050 which incorporate the six key focus areas and align with elements of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals and build on the momentum of our successful achievement of our 2020 sustainability goals. A key focus of our sustainability efforts is climate action, which includes our commitment to reduce carbon emissions.

Guests

Our goal is to deliver unmatched joyful vacations for our guests by consistently exceeding their expectations while providing them with a wide variety of exceptional vacation experiences and attractive itineraries. We believe that our portfolio of brands is instrumental to this, alongside our continual focus on helping our guests choose the cruise brand that will best meet their unique needs and desires, improving their overall vacation experiences and building state-of-the-art ships with innovative onboard offerings and providing unequaled service to our guests. 

Employees

Our goal is to foster a positive and just corporate culture, based on inclusion and the power of diversity that supports the recruitment, development and retention of the finest employees. A team of highly motivated and engaged employees is key to delivering unmatched joyful vacations that exceed our guests’ expectations. Understanding the critical skills that are needed for outstanding performance is crucial in order to hire and train our officers, crew and shoreside personnel. We believe in building trust-based relationships and listening to and acting upon our employees’ perspectives and ideas and using employee feedback tools to monitor and improve our progress in this area. We are a diverse organization and value and support our talented and diverse employee base. We are committed to employing people from around the world and hiring individuals based on the quality of their experience, skills, education and character, without regard for their identification with any group or classification of people.

Investors and Other Stakeholders

We value the relationships we have with our investors and other stakeholders, including travel agents, trade associations, communities, regulatory bodies, media, creditors, insurers, shipbuilders, governments and suppliers. Strong relationships with our travel agent partners are especially vital to our success. We believe that engaging stakeholders in a mutually beneficial manner is critical to our long-term success. As part of this effort, we believe we must continue to be an outstanding corporate citizen in the communities in which we operate. Our brands work to meet or exceed their economic, environmental, ethical and legal responsibilities.

B. Global Cruise Industry

 I. Overview

In the face of the global impact of COVID-19, we paused our guest cruise operations in mid-March 2020. As of January 13, 2022, eight of our nine brands, or 67% of capacity, had resumed guest cruise operations as part of our gradual return to service. We expect to have our full fleet back in operation for our summer season where we historically generate the largest share of our operating income.

We believe cruising offers a broad range of products and services to suit vacationing guests of many ages, backgrounds and interests. Each brand in our portfolio meets the needs of a unique set of consumer psychographics and vacation needs which allows us to penetrate large addressable customer segments. The mobility of cruise ships enables us to move our vessels between regions in order to meet changing demand across different geographic areas. 

Cruise brands can be broadly classified as offering contemporary, premium and luxury cruise experiences. The contemporary experience has a more casual ambiance and historically includes cruises that last seven days or less. The premium experience emphasizes quality, comfort, style and more destination-focused itineraries and appeals to those who are more affluent. Historically, the premium experience includes cruises that last from seven to 14 days. The luxury experience is usually characterized by very high standards of accommodation and service, smaller vessel size and exotic itineraries to ports that are inaccessible by larger ships. We have product and service offerings in each of these three broad classifications.

Due to the gradual resumption of guest cruise operations, data for 2021 is not representative of a typical full year of operations. Due to the impact of COVID-19 on the global cruise industry, data for 2020 is not meaningful and is not included in the table. We have provided 2019 data as we believe it is most representative of our future Cruise Programs.

 VII. Cruise Pricing and Payment Terms 

Each of our cruise brands publishes prices for the upcoming seasons primarily through the internet, although published materials such as direct mailings are also used. Our brands have multiple pricing levels that vary by source market, category of guest accommodation, ship, season, duration and itinerary. Cruise prices frequently change in a dynamic pricing environment and are impacted by a number of factors, including the number of available cabins for sale in the marketplace and the level of guest demand. We offer a variety of special promotions, including early booking, past guest recognition and travel agent programs. 

Our bookings are generally taken several months in advance of the cruise departure date. Historically, the longer the cruise itinerary the further in advance the bookings are made. This lead time allows us to manage our prices in relation to demand for available cabins through the use of advanced revenue management capabilities and other initiatives. 

The cruise ticket price typically includes the following: 

• Accommodations 

• Most meals, including snacks at numerous venues 

• Access to amenities such as swimming pools, water slides, water parks, whirlpools, a health club, and sun decks 

• Child care and supervised youth programs 

• Entertainment, such as theatrical and comedy shows, live music and nightclubs 

• Visits to multiple destinations 

We offer value added packages to induce ticket sales to guests and groups and to encourage advance purchase of certain onboard items. These packages are bundled with cruise tickets and sold to guests for a single price rather than as a separate package and may include one or more of the following: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our brands’ payment terms generally require that a guest pay a deposit to confirm their reservation and then pay the balance due before the departure date. We have provided flexibility to guests with bookings on sailings cancelled due to the pause in guest cruise operations by allowing guests to receive enhanced future cruise credits (“FCC”) or to elect to receive refunds in cash. 

 VIII. Seasonality

Our passenger ticket revenues are seasonal. Historically, demand for cruises has been greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months. This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher ticket prices and occupancy levels and, accordingly, the largest share of our operating income is typically earned during this period. This historical trend was disrupted in 2020 by the pause and in 2021 by the gradual resumption of guest cruise operations. In addition, substantially all of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours’ revenue and net income (loss) is generated from May through September in conjunction with Alaska’s cruise season. Since 2020, the Alaska cruise seasons have been adversely impacted by the continued effects of COVID-19. 

11

IX. Onboard and Other Revenues

Onboard and other activities are provided either directly by us or by independent concessionaires, from which we receive either a percentage of their revenues or a fee. Concession revenues do not have direct expenses because the costs and services incurred for concession revenues are borne by our concessionaires. In 2021, we earned 45% of our cruise revenues from onboard and other revenue goods and services. In 2019, our most recent full year of guest cruise operations, we earned 30% of our cruise revenues from onboard and other revenues.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 X. Marketing Activities

Guest feedback and research support the development of our overall marketing and business strategies to drive demand for cruises and increase the number of first-time cruisers. Our goal has always been to increase consumer awareness for cruise vacations and further grow our share of their vacation spend. We measure and evaluate key drivers of guest loyalty and their satisfaction with our products and services that provide valuable insights about guests’ cruise experiences. We closely monitor our net promoter scores, which reflect the likelihood that our guests will recommend our brands’ cruise products and services to friends and family. 

While we significantly reduced our marketing activities during 2020 and 2021 as a result of COVID-19, our brands historically have had comprehensive marketing and advertising programs across diverse mediums to promote their products and services to vacationers and our travel agent partners. Each brand’s marketing activities have generally been designed to reach a local region in the local language. Our marketing efforts historically have allowed us to attract new guests online by leveraging the reach and impact of digital marketing and social media. Over time, we have invested in new marketing technologies to deliver more engaging and personalized communications. This has helped us cultivate guests as advocates of our brands, ships, itineraries and onboard products and services. 

Substantially all of our cruise brands offer past guest recognition programs that reward repeat guests with special incentives such as reduced fares, gifts, onboard activity discounts, complimentary laundry and internet services, expedited ship embarkation and disembarkation and special onboard activities. 

 XI. Sales Channels

We sell our cruises through travel agents, tour operators, company vacation planners and our websites. Our individual cruise brands’ relationships with their travel agent partners are generally independent of each of our other brands. Our travel agents relationships are generally not exclusive and travel agents generally receive a base commission, plus the potential of additional commissions, including discounts or complimentary tour conductor cabins, based on the achievement of pre-defined sales volumes. 

Travel agent partners are an integral part of our long-term cruise distribution network and are critical to our success. We utilize local sales teams to motivate travel agents to support our products and services with competitive sales and pricing policies and joint marketing and advertising programs. We also employ a wide variety of educational programs, including websites, seminars and videos, to train agents on our cruise brands and their products and services. In 2021, due to physical distancing requirements, we held a variety of virtual training and educational programs to continue to support and develop our travel agent partners.

All of our brands have internet booking engines to allow travel agents to book our cruises. We also support travel agent booking capabilities through global distribution systems. All of our cruise brands have their own consumer websites that provide access to information about their products and services to users and enable their guests to quickly and easily book cruises and other products and services online. These sites interface with our brands’ social networks, blogs and other social media sites, which allow them to develop greater contact and interaction with their guests before, during and after their cruise. We also employ vacation planners who support our sales initiatives by offering our guests one-on-one cruise planning expertise and other services. 

12

 XII. Ethics and Compliance

We believe a clear and strong ethics and compliance culture is imperative for the future success of any corporation. Our compliance framework includes an Ethics and Compliance (“E&C”) governance function, as well as an ethics and compliance strategic plan. Our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, an executive officer and member of the executive leadership team, leads the effort to promote and monitor a strong ethics and compliance culture and further develop our E&C governance function throughout the company. This function involves monitoring compliance with health, environment, safety, security laws and other regulations, compliance risk management, improved compliance training programs for our employees, thorough investigations relating to health, environmental and safety incidents and efforts to strengthen our corporate culture. More specifically, the E&C governance function’s strategic plan sets out the following four goals: 

•Align and build upon fundamental principles - strengthen culture to support ethics and compliance 

•Be proactive and embrace a risk-based approach - develop a more strategic mindset 

•Assemble the people, platform and processes - organize ethics and compliance leadership, governance, systems and access to data and procedures 

•Listen and learn - promote open communications: speaking up, listening, learning and responding 

By taking these measures, we heightened our commitment to operate with integrity, which includes not only complying with applicable laws, but also treating our guests, employees and stakeholders with honesty, transparency and respect. To further heighten the focus on ethics and compliance, the Boards of Directors established the Compliance Committees, which oversee the E&C governance function, maintain regular communications with the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer and ensure implementation of the E&C governance function’s strategic plan. 

In 2020, despite the challenges related to COVID-19, we prioritized various improvements to be made during the pause in guest cruise operations called the Pause Priorities Plan. Throughout 2020 and 2021, we continued to make various improvements throughout our business. These improvements included the following: 

•In the environmental arena, we made progress on improving on and investing in food waste management; developing criteria used for bringing back qualified environmental and technical talent when we resumed guest cruise operations; launching our Fleet Environmental Officer Program to further support, train and coach our environmental officers; developing a new and improved virtual environmental training program for Environmental Officers; and improving our efforts to conduct due diligence on the waste vendors that we engage across the company.

•For health, safety and security, we have made substantial progress in developing new protocols, installation of filters and testing equipment, and new awareness training to respond to COVID-19 and to comply with governmental regulations.

•To strengthen our capabilities to conduct internal investigations of HESS incidents, we revised and improved our investigation procedures and developed new training on root cause analysis.

•To continue strengthening the corporate culture, we developed a Culture Action Plan, which consists of various activities undertaken since 2020, including efforts to highlight and incentivize key actions and behaviors, new trainings for managers and leaders, more frequent communications, revised performance evaluations and culture surveys to measure progress. More specifically, we implemented our Culture Essentials, which are the key actions and behaviors we are encouraging and reinforcing to further strengthen our culture. 

XIII. Sustainability 

We strive to be a company that people want to work for and to be an exemplary global corporate citizen. Our commitment and actions to keep our guests and crew members safe and comfortable, protect the environment, develop and provide opportunities for our workforce, strengthen stakeholder relations and enhance both the communities where we work as well as the port communities that our ships visit, are reflective of our brands’ core values and vital to our success as a business enterprise. 

We have established new goals for 2030 which incorporate six key focus areas listed below that align with elements of the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals and build on the momentum of our successful achievement of our 2020 sustainability goals. A key focus of our sustainability efforts is climate action which includes our commitment to reduce carbon emissions.

Climate Action 2030 Goals

•Achieve 40% carbon intensity reduction relative to our 2008 baseline measured in both grams of CO2e per ALB-km and grams of CO2e per ALBD 

13

•Having peaked our absolute carbon emissions in 2011, we plan to continue to reduce emissions over time, and identify a pathway to decarbonization

•Reduce absolute particulate matter air emissions by 50% relative to our 2015 baseline

•Increase fleet shore power connection capability to 60% of the fleet

•Expand liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) program

•Optimize the reach and performance of our Advanced Air Quality System program

•Expand battery, fuel cell and biofuel capabilities

•Reduce supply chain emissions associated with food procurement and waste management

•Identify carbon offset options only when energy efficiency options have been exhausted

Circular Economy 2030 Goals

•Achieved more than 50% reduction in single-use plastic items in 2021 relative to our 2018 baseline based on ships that have restarted during our gradual resumption of guest cruise operations

•Achieve 50% reduction in single-use plastic items in 2022 relative to our 2018 baseline based on full fleet operations

•Achieve 30% unit food waste reduction by 2022 and 50% by 2030 relative to our 2019 baseline

•Increase Advanced Waste Water Treatment System coverage to more than 75% of our fleet capacity

•Send a larger percentage of waste to waste-to-energy facilities where practical

•Partner with primary vendors to reduce upstream packaging volumes 

Good Health and Well-Being 2030 Goals

•Committed to continued job creation

•Implement global well-being standards by 2023

•Reduce the number of guest and crew work-related injuries

•Establish measurable Company Culture metrics and set annual improvement targets

Sustainable Tourism 2030 Goals

•Establish partnerships with destinations focused on sustainable economic development, preservation of local traditions and capacity management

•Continue to support disaster resilience, relief and recovery efforts

•Build stronger community relationships in our employment bases and destinations via employee volunteering programs

Biodiversity and Conservation 2030 Goals

•Support biodiversity and conservation initiatives through select nongovernmental organization partnerships

•Conduct audits and monitor animal encounter excursions regularly

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 2030 Goals

•Ensure our overall shoreside employee base reflects the diversity of the world by 2030

•Expand shipboard and shoreside diversity, equity and inclusion across all ranks and departments by 2030

Since the pause in guest cruise operations, we have accelerated our capacity optimization strategy, which includes the removal of less efficient ships from our fleet. This strategy, together with our ongoing ship newbuild program, which includes the delivery of more efficient ships and the natural retirement of less efficient ships, has been and will continue to be a factor in our expected ability to achieve our 2030 carbon intensity reduction goal. Furthermore, we have invested over $350 million in energy efficiency improvements in our existing fleet since 2016 and expect to continue to make similar investments as part of our plan to achieve our 2030 sustainability goals.

As part of our plan for carbon footprint reduction, we lead the cruise industry’s use of LNG powered cruise ships with a total of 11 next-generation cruise ships that are expected to join the fleet through 2025, including four ships already in operation as of November 30, 2021. In total, these ships are expected to represent 20% of our total future capacity. LNG vessels generate up to 20% less carbon emissions than traditionally powered ships, while almost eliminating sulfur oxides, reducing nitrogen oxides by 85% and particulate matter by 95%-100%. While fossil fuels are currently the only viable option for our industry, we are closely monitoring technology developments and partnering with key organizations on research and development to support our carbon emission reduction goals. For example, we are partnering to evaluate and pilot maritime scale battery technology and methanol powered fuel cells and working with classification societies and other stakeholders to assess lower carbon fuel options for cruise ships including hydrogen, methanol, eLNG, and biofuels. We also pioneered the use of Advanced Air Quality Systems on board our ships to aid in the reduction of sulfur emissions and are promoting the use of shore power, enabling ships to use shoreside electric power where available while in port. We do not expect the incremental efforts to meet our 2030 sustainability goals to have a material impact on our financial statements.

14

In addition to the 2030 sustainability goals, we have announced our 2050 aspirations. We are committed to continuing our reduction of carbon emissions and have aspirations to achieve net carbon-neutral ship operations by 2050, well ahead of current IMO targets, while minimizing the use of carbon offsets. To achieve this aspiration, we are partnering with key organizations to help identify and scale new technologies not yet ready for the cruise industry. We believe our scale will support our effort to lead the industry in climate action.

We voluntarily publish Sustainability Reports that address governance, stakeholder engagement, environmental, labor, human rights, society, product responsibility, economic and other sustainability-related issues and performance indicators. These reports, which are not incorporated in this document but can be viewed at www.carnivalcorp.com, www.carnivalplc.com and www.carnivalsustainability.com, were developed in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (“GRI”) Standards, the global standard for sustainability reporting. For the first time, within our separate sustainability report, we have voluntarily incorporated disclosures in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) framework and reported our progress consistent with the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) guidance. We have been publishing Sustainability Reports since 2011. 

 XIV. Human Capital Management and Employees 

Our shipboard and shoreside employees are sourced from well over 100 countries. In connection with our gradual resumption of guest cruise operations in 2021, we increased the number of employees onboard certain of our ships from the reduced levels during the pause in guest cruise operations. In 2021, we had an average of 30,000 employees onboard our ships, excluding employees on leave. Our shoreside operations had an annual average of 9,000 full-time and 1,000 part-time/seasonal employees. As a result of the reduction in our shoreside workforce during the early part of our pause in guest cruise operations to preserve cash, we require additional personnel to support the return of our full fleet to guest cruise operations. During 2021, we opened a significant number of shoreside positions, many of which remained open as of November 30, 2021 due to an increasingly competitive labor market. In 2019, our most recent full year of guest cruise operations, we had an average of 92,000 employees on our ships, excluding employees on leave and our shoreside operations had an annual average of 12,000 full-time and 2,000 part-time/seasonal employees. Holland America Princess Alaska Tours significantly increases its work force during the late spring and summer months in connection with the Alaskan cruise season. We have entered into agreements with unions covering certain employees on our ships and in our shoreside hotel and transportation operations. The percentages of our shipboard and shoreside employees that are represented by collective bargaining agreements are 58% and 28%, respectively. We consider our employee and union relationships to be strong. 

A team of highly motivated and engaged employees is key to delivering unmatched joyful vacations that exceed our guests’ expectations. To facilitate the recruitment, development and retention of our valuable team members, we strive to make Carnival Corporation & plc a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. 

a.Talent Development

We believe in the investment in our team members through the training and development of both shoreside and shipboard employees. During the pause in guest cruise operations, our training teams have made significant progress in delivering virtual training to augment the normal training historically completed in-person. We anticipate that as we continue to transition to full guest cruise operations that we will continue to leverage a combination of virtual and in-person training to ensure that our teams are well-prepared to carry out their individual and collective responsibilities.

For our shipboard employees, our goal is to be a leader in delivering high quality professional maritime training, as evidenced by the Arison Maritime Center. The Center is home to the Center for Simulator Maritime Training (“CSMART”). The leading-edge CSMART Academy features the most advanced bridge and engine room simulator technology and equipment available, with the capacity to provide annual professional training for all our bridge, engineering and environmental officers. CSMART participants receive a maritime training experience that fosters advanced knowledge and skills development, critical thinking and problem solving; all in a professional learning environment where our corporate culture is reinforced. CSMART also offers training related to LNG technology as well as an environmental officer training program and additional environmental courses for bridge and engineering officers to further enhance our training on environmental awareness and protection.

b.Succession Planning

Our Boards of Directors believe that planning for succession is an important function. Our multi-brand structure enhances our succession planning process. At the corporate level, a highly-skilled management team oversees a collection of cruise brands. 

15

At both the corporate and brand levels, we continually strive to foster the professional development of senior management and other critical roles. As a result, Carnival Corporation & plc has developed a very experienced and strong group of leaders, with their performance subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, as potential successors to all of our senior executive positions, including our Chief Executive Officer.

 XV. Supply Chain

We incur expenses for goods and services to deliver exceptional cruise experiences to our guests. In addition, we incur significant capital expenditures for materials to support the refurbishment and enhancements of our vessels as well as to build new ships. We approach our spend strategically and look for suppliers who demonstrate the ability to help us leverage our scale in terms of cost, quality, service, innovation and sustainability. We are focused on the creation of strategic partnerships and will streamline our supplier base where it is prudent and on a risk-based basis. Our largest capital investments are for the construction of new ships.

COVID-19 is continuing to impact global supply markets and supply chains, resulting in shortages, extended lead times and increased inflation impacting our operations and profitability. We are applying a number of different strategies to mitigate the impact of these challenges on our operations, including extending our demand planning, placing purchase orders earlier, leveraging corporate contracts, utilizing short term contracts and leveraging our supplier relationships. 

 XVI. Insurance

a.General

We maintain insurance to cover a number of risks associated with owning and operating our vessels and other non-ship related risks. All such insurance policies are subject to coverage limits, exclusions and deductible levels. Insurance premiums are dependent on our own loss experience and the general premium requirements of our insurers. We maintain certain levels of deductibles for substantially all the below-mentioned coverages. We may increase our deductibles to mitigate future premium increases. We do not carry coverage related to loss of earnings or revenues from our ships or other operations. 

b.Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) Coverages

Liabilities, costs and expenses for illness and injury to crew, guest injury, pollution and other third-party claims in connection with our cruise activities are covered by our P&I clubs, which are mutual indemnity associations owned by ship owners. 

We are members of three P&I clubs, Gard, Steamship Mutual and UK Club, which are part of a worldwide group of 13 P&I clubs, known as the International Group of P&I Clubs (the “IG”). The IG insures directly, and through broad and established reinsurance markets, a large portion of the world’s shipping fleets. Coverage is subject to the P&I clubs’ rules and the limits of coverage are determined by the IG. 

c.Hull and Machinery Insurance

We maintain insurance on the hull and machinery of each of our ships for reasonable amounts as determined by management. The coverage for hull and machinery is provided by large and well-established international marine insurers. Insurers make it a condition for insurance coverage that a ship be certified as “in class” by a classification society that is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies (“IACS”). All of our ships are routinely inspected and certified to be in class by an IACS member. 

d.War Risk Insurance

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to cover war risk for legal liability to crew, guests and other third parties as well as loss or damage to our vessels arising from war or war-like actions. Our primary war risk insurance coverage is provided by international marine insurers and our excess war risk insurance is provided by our three P&I clubs. Under the terms of our war risk insurance coverage, which are typical for war risk policies in the marine industry, insurers can give us seven days’ notice that the insurance policies will be canceled. However, the policies can be reinstated at different premium rates. 

16

e.Other Insurance 

We maintain property insurance covering our shoreside assets and casualty insurance covering liabilities to third parties arising from our hotel and transportation business, shore excursion operations and shoreside operations, including our port and related commercial facilities. We also maintain worker’s compensation, director’s and officer’s liability and other insurance coverages. 

 XVII. Governmental Regulations

 a. Maritime Regulations 

 1. General

Our ships are regulated by numerous international, national, state and local laws, regulations, treaties and other legal requirements, as well as voluntary agreements, which govern health, environmental, safety and security matters in relation to our guests, crew and ships. These requirements change regularly, sometimes on a daily basis, depending on the itineraries of our ships and the ports and countries visited. If we violate or fail to comply with any of these laws, regulations, treaties and other requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators. We are committed to complying with, or exceeding, all relevant maritime requirements. 

The primary regulatory bodies that establish maritime laws and requirements applicable to our ships include: 

The International Maritime Organization (“IMO”): All of our ships, and the maritime industry as a whole, are subject to the maritime safety, security and environmental regulations established by the IMO, a specialized agency of the United Nations. The IMO’s principal sets of requirements are mandated through its International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (“SOLAS”) and its International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (“MARPOL”). 

Flag States: Our ships are registered, or flagged, in The Bahamas, Bermuda, Italy, the Netherlands, Panama and the UK, which are also referred to as Flag States. Our ships are regulated by these Flag States through international conventions that govern, among other things, health, environmental, safety and security matters in relation to our guests, crew and ships. Representatives of each Flag State conduct periodic inspections, surveys and audits to verify compliance with these requirements. 

Ship classification societies: Class certification is one of the necessary documents required for our cruise ships to be flagged in a specific country, obtain liability insurance and legally operate as passenger cruise ships. Our ships are subject to periodic class surveys, including dry-dock inspections, by ship classification societies to verify that our ships have been maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification societies and that recommended repairs have been satisfactorily completed. Dry-dock frequency is a statutory requirement mandated by SOLAS. Our ships dry-dock once or twice every five years, depending on the age of the ship. 

National, regional and other authorities: We are subject to the decrees, directives, regulations and requirements of the European Union (“EU”), the UK, the U.S., other countries and hundreds of other authorities including international ports that our ships visit every year. 

Port regulatory authorities (Port State Control): Our ships are also subject to inspection by the port regulatory authorities, which are also referred to as Port State Control, in the various countries that they visit. Such inspections include verification of compliance with the maritime safety, security, environmental, customs, immigration, health and labor requirements applicable to each port, as well as with regional, national and international requirements. Many countries have joined together to form regional Port State Control authorities. 

As members of the Cruise Lines International Association (“CLIA”), we helped to develop and have implemented policies that are intended to enhance shipboard safety and environmental protection throughout the cruise industry. In some cases this calls for implementing best practices, which are in excess of existing legal requirements. Further details on these and other policies, which are not incorporated into this document, can be found on www.cruising.org. 

Our Boards of Directors have HESS Committees, which were comprised of six independent directors as of December 1, 2021. The principal function of the HESS Committees is to assist the boards in fulfilling their responsibility to supervise and monitor our health, environment, safety, security and sustainability related policies, programs and initiatives at sea and ashore and 

17

compliance with related legal and regulatory requirements. The HESS Committees and our management team review all significant relevant risks or exposures and associated mitigating actions. 

We are committed to implementing appropriate measures to manage identified risks effectively. We have a Chief Maritime Officer to oversee our global maritime operations, including maritime policy, maritime affairs, training, shipbuilding, asset management, ship refits and research and development. In addition, we have a Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer who is responsible for overseeing our ethics and compliance governance function, including all areas of HESS.

To help ensure that we are compliant with legal and regulatory requirements and that these areas of our business operate in an efficient and effective manner we: 

•Provide regular health, environmental, safety and security support, training, guidance and information to guests, employees and others working on our behalf 

•Develop and implement effective and verifiable management systems to fulfill our health, environmental, safety, security and sustainability commitments 

•Perform regular shoreside and shipboard audits and take appropriate action when deficiencies are identified 

•Report and investigate health, environmental, safety and security incidents and strive to take appropriate action to prevent recurrence 

•Identify those employees responsible for managing health, environment, safety, security and sustainability programs and aim to establish clear lines of accountability 

•Identify the aspects of our business with potential to impact the environment and continue to take appropriate action to minimize that impact 

•Monitor an anonymous hotline for any reported allegations or concerns and the related responses 

•Review and work to improve policies and procedures designed to prevent, detect, respond and correct various regulatory violations and other misconduct 

 2. Maritime Safety Regulations

The IMO has adopted safety standards as part of SOLAS. To help ensure guest and crew safety, SOLAS establishes requirements for the following: 

• Vessel design and structural features• Life-saving and other equipment

• Construction and materials• Fire protection and detection

• Refurbishment standards• Safe management and operation

• Radio communications• Musters

All of our crew undergo regular safety training that meets or exceeds all international maritime regulations, including SOLAS requirements, which are periodically revised. 

SOLAS requires implementation of the International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), which provides an international standard for the safe management and operation of ships and for pollution prevention. The ISM Code is mandatory for passenger vessel operators. Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to: 

•Develop and implement a Safety Management System (“SMS”) that includes, among other things, the adoption of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating vessels safely and describing procedures for responding to emergencies and protecting the environment. In addition, our SMS includes health and security procedures. 

•Obtain a Document of Compliance (“DOC”) for the vessel operator, as well as a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) for each vessel they operate. These documents are issued by the vessel’s Flag State and evidence compliance with the ISM Code and the SMS 

•Verify or renew DOCs and SMCs periodically in accordance with the ISM Code 

We have implemented and continue to develop policies and procedures that we believe enhance our commitment to the safety of our guests and crew. These initiatives include the following: 

•Training of our bridge, engineering and environmental officers in maritime related best practices facilitated by our CSMART Academy, the Center for Simulator Maritime Training located within our Arison Maritime Center in Almere, Netherlands 

18

•Further standardization of our detailed bridge and engine resource management procedures on our ships 

•Expansion of our existing oversight function to monitor and assist operations through state of the art fleet operations centers in Miami and Hamburg 

•Identifying and promoting the use of international standards and best-practice policies and procedures in health, environmental, safety and security disciplines across the organization including on all our ships 

•Further enhancement of our processes for auditing our HESS performance throughout our operations 

  3. Maritime Security Regulations

Our ships are subject to numerous security requirements. These requirements include the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code, which is part of SOLAS, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, which addresses U.S. port and waterway security and the U.S. Cruise Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010, which applies to all of our ships that embark or disembark passengers in the U.S. These regulations include requirements as to the following: 

•Implementation of specific security measures, including onboard installation of a ship security alert system 

•Assessment of vessel security 

•Efforts to identify and deter security threats 

•Training, drills and exercises 

•Security plans that may include guest, vehicle and baggage screening procedures, security patrols, establishment of restricted areas, personnel identification procedures, access control measures and installation of surveillance equipment 

•Establishment of procedures and policies for reporting and managing allegations of crimes 

 4. Maritime Environmental Regulations

We are subject to numerous international, multi-national, national, state and local environmental laws, regulations and treaties that govern air emissions, waste management, and the storage, handling, use and disposal of hazardous substances such as chemicals, solvents and paints. 

As a means of managing and improving our environmental performance and compliance, we adhere to standards set by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”), an international standard-setting body, which produces worldwide industrial and commercial standards. The environmental management system of our company and ships is certified in accordance with ISO 14001, the environmental management standard that was developed to help organizations manage the environmental impacts of their processes, products and services. ISO 14001 defines an approach to setting and achieving environmental objectives and targets, within a structured management framework. 

 i. International Regulations

The principal international convention governing marine pollution prevention and response is MARPOL. 

 a. Preventing and Minimizing Pollution 

MARPOL includes six annexes, four of which are applicable to our cruise ships, containing requirements designed to prevent and minimize both accidental and operational pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions and sets forth specific requirements related to vessel operations, equipment, recordkeeping and reporting that are designed to prevent and minimize pollution. All of our ships must carry an International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Sewage Pollution Prevention Certificate, an International Air Pollution Prevention Certificate and a Garbage Management Plan. The ship’s Flag State issues these certificates, which evidence their compliance with the MARPOL regulations regarding prevention of pollution by oil, sewage, garbage and air emissions. Certain jurisdictions have not adopted all of these MARPOL annexes but have established various national, regional or local laws and regulations that apply to these areas. 

As noted above, MARPOL governs the prevention of pollution by oil from operational measures, as well as from accidental discharges. MARPOL requires that discharges of machinery space bilge water pass through pollution prevention equipment that separates oil from the water and monitors the discharged water to ensure that the effluent does not exceed 15 parts per million oil content. During 2019, we voluntarily completed the upgrade of oily water separation equipment to the latest MARPOL standards as set forth by the IMO onboard all of our ships. Our ships have oily water separators with oil content monitors installed and maintain a record of certain engine room operations in an Oil Record Book. In addition, we have voluntarily installed redundant systems on all of our ships that monitor processed bilge water a second time prior to discharge to help 

19

ensure that it contains no more than 15 parts per million oil content. This system also provides additional controls to prevent improper bilge water discharges. MARPOL also requires that our ships have Shipboard Oil Pollution Emergency Plans. 

MARPOL also governs the discharge of sewage from ships and contains regulations regarding the ships’ equipment and systems for the control of sewage discharge, the provision of facilities at ports and terminals for the reception of sewage and requirements for survey and certification. 

MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships and requires the implementation of Garbage Management Plan and the maintenance of a Garbage Record Book. 

Furthermore, MARPOL addresses air emissions from vessels, establishes requirements for the prevention of air pollution from ships to reduce emissions of sulfur oxides (“SOx”), nitrogen oxides (“NOx”) and particulate matter. It also contains restrictions on the use of ozone depleting substances (“ODS”) and requires the recording of ODS use, equipment containing ODS and the emission of ODS. 

 b. Sulfur Emissions 

The IMO has adopted a global 0.5% sulfur cap for marine fuel which began in January 2020. The EU Parliament and Council has also adopted 0.5% sulfur content fuel requirement (the “EU Sulfur Directive”). The options to comply with both the global 0.5% sulfur cap and the EU Sulfur Directive include the installation of Advanced Air Quality Systems, or the use of low sulfur or alternative fuels. 

MARPOL addresses air emissions from both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on ships and further specifies requirements for Emission Control Areas (“ECAs”) with stricter limitations on sulfur emissions content in these areas, requiring ships to use fuel with a sulfur content of no more than 0.1%, or to use alternative emission reduction methods, such as Advanced Air Quality Systems.

We have Advanced Air Quality Systems on most of our ships, which are aiding in partially mitigating the financial impact from the ECAs and global 0.5% sulfur requirements.

 c. Other Ship Emission Abatement Methods 

In the long-term, the cost impacts of meeting progressively lower sulfur fuel requirements may be further mitigated by the future developments of, and investments in, improved sulfur emission abatement technologies, the use of alternative lower cost and lower emission fuels and our continued efforts to improve the overall fuel efficiency across our fleet. Our ongoing efforts to reduce unit fuel consumption include a focus on itinerary planning and voyage optimization, investment in various energy-efficiency upgrades (including enhancements to vessel air conditioning systems, lighting, waste heat recovery, engine performance improvements and hydrodynamic upgrades), enhanced training and energy awareness for our shipboard teams, collaborative energy-savings groups across operating lines and a shift towards better informed data-driven energy related decisions. 

As part of our emission abatement program, we have continued our work with several local port authorities to utilize cruise ship shore power connections and have equipped 42 of our ships with the ability to utilize shore power technology. This technology enables our ships to use power from the local electricity provider rather than running their engines while in port to power their onboard services, resulting in reduced ship air emissions. 

Similarly, in an effort to extend our commitment to sustainability and to play a leading role in matters of environmental protection in the cruise industry, we are expanding our investment in the use of lower carbon fuels, in particular LNG. AIDAnova, the first cruise ship in the world with the ability to use LNG to generate 100 percent of its power both in port and on the open sea, entered the fleet in December 2018, followed by three additional LNG ships, Costa Smeralda, Iona and Mardi Gras. As of November 30, 2021, we also had seven additional LNG cruise ships on order, including Costa Toscana and AIDAcosma, which entered the fleet in December 2021 and Carnival Celebration, entering the fleet in November 2022. These ships generate up to 20% less carbon emissions than traditionally powered ships and we believe, on balance, may help to reduce our impact on the environment. While fossil fuels are currently the only viable option for our industry, we are closely monitoring technology developments and partnering with key organizations on research and development to support our carbon emission reduction goals.

20

 d. Greenhouse Gas Emissions (“GHG”) 

In 2013, the IMO approved measures to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions of GHGs from international shipping by adopting technical and operational measures for all ships. The technical measures apply to the design of new vessels, and the operational reduction measures apply to all vessels. Operational reduction measures have been implemented through a variety of means, including a Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, improved voyage planning and more frequent propeller and hull cleanings. We have established objectives within the ISO 14001 environmental management system for each of our brands to further reduce fuel consumption rates and the resulting GHG emissions. 

In 2016, the IMO approved the implementation of a mandatory data collection system (“DCS”) for fuel oil consumption. The DCS requires ships of 5,000 gross tons and above to provide fuel oil consumption data to their respective Flag State at the end of each calendar year, beginning in 2019. Flag States validate the data and transfer it to an IMO database. The IMO will produce a summary annual report with anonymous data. In 2018, the IMO also set aspirations to achieve several shipping industry GHG emission reduction goals with 2030 and 2050 target dates. In November 2020, the IMO’s Marine Environment Protection Committee approved further MARPOL changes in support of its GHG emission reduction goals, which are expected to enter into force on January 1, 2023 and include annual ship-level unit emissions performance improvement expectations that could negatively impact our itinerary flexibility and marketability. In addition, the IMO is currently considering various other proposals which aim to reduce GHG emissions within the global shipping industry. These proposals include a range of measures including possible fuel standards and market-based measures, such as carbon taxes, that, if enacted, could result in reduced revenue or increased compliance related costs which may individually and collectively have a material impact on our profitability. The exact impact is uncertain as the proposals have not yet been finalized and enacted. 

 e. Ballast Water 

Ballast water is water used to stabilize ships at sea and maintain safe operating conditions throughout a voyage. Ballast water can carry a multitude of marine species. In 2017, the IMO’s Ballast Water Management Convention entered into force, which governs the discharge of ballast water from ships. Subsequent amendments effectively extended the implementation date for installation of ballast water management systems for existing ships by about two years, though other requirements went into effect immediately, including requirements for ballast water exchange, record keeping, and maintaining an approved Ballast Water Management Plan. The Convention is designed to regulate the treatment of ballast water prior to discharging overboard in order to avoid the transfer of marine species to new environments, as well as establishing other ballast water management practices for monitoring and environmental protection. 

 ii. U.S. Federal and State Regulations

The Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships implements several MARPOL Annexes in the U.S. and imposes numerous requirements on our ships, as discussed above. Administrative, civil and criminal penalties may be assessed for violations. 

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) established a comprehensive federal liability regime, as well as prevention and response requirements, relating to discharges of oil in U.S. waters. The major requirements include demonstrating financial responsibility up to the liability limits set by OPA 90 and having oil spill response plans in place. We have Certificates of Financial Responsibility (“COFR”) that demonstrate our ability to meet the liability limits of OPA 90 based on the gross tonnage of our ships for removal costs and damages, such as from an oil spill. The COFR also covers releases of hazardous substances. It is possible, however, for our liability limits to be broken, which could expose us to unlimited liability. Under OPA 90, owners or operators of vessels operating in U.S. waters must file Vessel Response Plans with the U.S. Coast Guard (“USCG”) and must operate and conduct any response action in compliance with these plans. As OPA 90 expressly allows coastal states to impose liabilities and requirements beyond those imposed under federal law, many U.S. states have enacted laws more stringent than OPA 90. Some of these state laws impose unlimited liability for oil spills and contain more stringent financial responsibility and contingency planning requirements. Most coastal states have also enacted environmental regulations that impose strict liability for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance, similar to OPA 90. 

The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) provides the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) with the authority to regulate incidental discharges from commercial vessels, including discharges of ballast water, bilge water, gray water, anti-fouling paints and other substances during normal operations within the U.S. three mile territorial sea and inland waters. Pursuant to the CWA authority, the U.S. National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System was designed to minimize pollution within U.S. territorial waters. For our affected ships, the incidental discharge requirements are set forth in EPA’s Vessel General Permit (“VGP”) for discharges incidental to the normal operations of vessels. The VGP establishes effluent limits for 27 specific discharges incidental to the normal operation of a vessel, many of which apply to our cruise ships. In addition to the 

21

requirements associated with these discharges and more stringent vessel-specific requirements, the VGP includes requirements for inspections, monitoring, reporting and record-keeping. In 2018, the Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (“VIDA”) was signed into law and was intended to clarify and streamline discharge requirements for the incidental discharges covered by the VGP and certain USCG regulations for ballast water. More specifically, a new section was added to the CWA called “Uniform National Standards for Discharges Incidental to Normal Operation of Vessels.” Once fully implemented, VIDA will replace the VGP; however, while the standards and regulations are being developed, which is expected to take at least until the end of 2022, the 2013 VGP has been administratively extended and will remain in effect. VIDA requires the standards and regulations to be at least as stringent as the existing requirements in the 2013 VGP and USCG regulations, unless information becomes available that was not reasonably available when the initial standard of performance was issued, and that information would have justified a less stringent standard. In October 2020, the EPA posted its notice of proposed rulemaking to set standards for 20 types of vessel discharges incidental to normal operations. The discharge standards are organized into three categories: (1) general operation and maintenance; (2) biofouling management; and (3) oil management. These standards mandate overall minimization of discharges and prescribe associated best management practices. No training or education requirements are included, as these will be set by the USCG in its rulemaking once EPA’s standards are finalized. Notably, EPA incorporated discharge standards applicable to exhaust gas cleaning system discharges based substantially on applicable IMO guidelines, which better harmonizes the VGP and IMO requirements. While the proposed rule provides clarity into the likely structure of VIDA, there is uncertainty over the mechanism through which state-specific standards may be implemented.

We are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act for the disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are generated by our ships. In general, vessel owners are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous and, when landing waste ashore, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes, including the use of hazardous waste manifests for shipments to approved disposal facilities. 

The U.S. National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) was enacted in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into U.S. waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign waters. The USCG adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. Depending on a vessel’s compliance date for installation of a USCG type-approved ballast water management system, these requirements may now be met by performing mid-ocean ballast exchange, by retaining ballast water onboard the vessel or by using a ballast water management system authorized or approved by the USCG. In the near future, ballast exchange will no longer be permissible. These USCG regulations, however, will ultimately be replaced with the new regulatory regime being developed under VIDA, which is expected to contain similar requirements. 

The state of Alaska has enacted legislation that prohibits certain discharges in designated Alaskan waters and sets effluent limits on others, which are applicable to cruise ships. Further, the state of Alaska requires that certain discharges be reported and monitored to verify compliance with the standards established by the legislation. Environmental regimes in Alaska are more stringent than the U.S. federal requirements with regard to discharges from vessels. The legislation also provides that repeat violators of the regulations could be prohibited from operating in Alaskan waters. The state of California also has environmental requirements significantly more stringent than federal requirements for water discharges and air emissions. 

 iii. EU Regulations

The EU has adopted a broad range of substantial environmental measures aimed at improving the quality of the environment for European citizens. To support the implementation and enforcement of European environmental legislation, the EU has adopted directives on environmental liability and enforcement and a recommendation providing for minimum criteria for environmental inspections. 

The European Commission’s (“EC”) strategy is to reduce emissions from ships. The EC strategy seeks to implement SOx Emission Control Areas set out in MARPOL, as discussed above. 

The EC has also implemented regulations aimed at reducing GHG emissions from maritime shipping through a Monitoring, Reporting and Verification regulation, which involves collecting emissions data from ships over 5,000 gross tons to monitor and report carbon emissions on all voyages to, from and between European Union ports. 

The EU has a series of significant carbon reforms as a part of its Fit for 55 package to meet its 2030 emissions reduction goal. The main instruments for reducing emissions are the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”), Energy Taxation Directive (“ETD”) and the newly proposed FuelEU Maritime initiative.

22

The ETS regulates carbon emissions through a “cap and trade” principle, where a cap is set on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted. The proposed updates to the ETS could lead to carbon allowances being introduced in the maritime sector.

The ETD is a framework for the taxation of energy products and sets minimum rates of excise duty to encourage a low-carbon economy. Proposed amendments to the ETD will introduce new tax rates based on the energy content and environmental impact rather than volume. These amendments will also widen the directive to include maritime fuels, which were previously exempt. 

The recently proposed FuelEU Maritime initiative is a long-term framework to reduce maritime emissions by increasing the use of sustainable alternative fuels and for the cruise industry the use of shore power. The proposal also requires compliance with the maximum limits of GHG intensity of energy used on board. The stringency of these limits increase over time and there are financial penalties for non-compliance. 

If enacted, the Fit for 55 regulations may individually and collectively result in increased costs and have a material impact on our profitability beginning in 2023.The exact impact is uncertain as the proposals have not yet been finalized and enacted.

Compliance with such regulations and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change.

 5. Maritime Health Regulations

We are committed to providing a healthy environment for all of our guests and crew. We collaborate with public health inspection programs throughout the world, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) in the U.S. and the SHIPSAN Project in the EU as well as CLIA’s Public Health and Medical Policy, to ensure that development of these programs leads to enhanced health and hygiene onboard our ships. Through our collaborative efforts, we work with the authorities to develop and revise guidelines, review plans and conduct on-site inspections for all newbuilds and significant ship renovations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the cruise industry has been subject to various enhanced regulations from the various regulatory bodies of worldwide health authorities resulting in the issuance of prescriptive protocols we are required to comply with to operate. We continue to work closely with governments and health authorities around the world to ensure that our health and safety protocols comply with the requirements of each location. In addition, we continue to maintain our ships by meeting, and often exceeding, applicable public health guidelines and requirements, complying with inspections, reporting communicable illnesses and conducting regular crew training and guest education programs.

  6. Maritime Labor Regulations

The International Labor Organization develops and oversees international labor standards and includes a broad range of requirements, such as the definition of a seafarer, minimum age of seafarers, medical certificates, recruitment practices, training, repatriation, food, recreational facilities, health and welfare, hours of work and rest, accommodations, wages and entitlements. 

The International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers, as amended, establishes additional minimum standards relating to training, including security training, certification and watchkeeping for our seafarers. 

 b. Other Governmental Regulations

In most countries where we source the majority of our guests, we are required to establish financial responsibility, such as obtaining a guarantee from stable financial institutions and insurance companies, to satisfy liability in cases of our non-performance of obligations to our guests. The amount of financial responsibility varies by jurisdiction based on the amount mandated by the applicable local regulatory agency or association. 

In Australia and most of Europe, we may be obligated to honor our guests’ cruise payments made by them to their travel agents and tour operators regardless of whether we receive these payments. 

We are also subject to many other laws and regulations which require our compliance, including those addressing antitrust, anti-money laundering, data privacy, securities, sanctions, bribery and corruption, as well as human resources related matters.

23

 XVIII. Taxation 

A summary of our principal taxes and exemptions in the jurisdictions where our significant operations are located is as follows: 

a.U.S. Income Tax

We are primarily foreign corporations engaged in the business of operating cruise ships in international transportation. We also own and operate, among other businesses, the U.S. hotel and transportation business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours through U.S. corporations.

Our North American cruise ship businesses and certain ship-owning subsidiaries are engaged in a trade or business within the U.S. Depending on its itinerary, any particular ship may generate income from sources within the U.S. We believe that our U.S. source income and the income of our ship-owning subsidiaries, to the extent derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships, is currently exempt from U.S. federal income and branch profit taxes. 

Our domestic U.S. operations, principally the hotel and transportation business of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours, are subject to federal and state income taxation in the U.S.

1.Application of Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code

In general, under Section 883 of the Internal Revenue Code, certain non-U.S. corporations (such as our North American cruise ship businesses) are not subject to U.S. federal income tax or branch profits tax on U.S. source income derived from, or incidental to, the international operation of a ship or ships. Applicable U.S. Treasury regulations provide in general that a foreign corporation will qualify for the benefits of Section 883 if, in relevant part, (i) the foreign country in which the foreign corporation is organized grants an equivalent exemption to corporations organized in the U.S. in respect of each category of shipping income for which an exemption is being claimed under Section 883 (an “equivalent exemption jurisdiction”) and (ii) the foreign corporation meets a defined publicly-traded corporation stock ownership test (the “publicly-traded test”). Subsidiaries of foreign corporations that are organized in an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and meet the publicly-traded test also benefit from Section 883. We believe that Panama is an equivalent exemption jurisdiction and that Carnival Corporation currently satisfies the publicly-traded test under the regulations. Accordingly, substantially all of Carnival Corporation’s income is exempt from U.S. federal income and branch profit taxes. 

Regulations under Section 883 list certain activities that the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) does not consider to be incidental to the international operation of ships and, therefore, the income attributable to such activities, to the extent such income is U.S. source, does not qualify for the Section 883 exemption. Among the activities identified as not incidental are income from the sale of air transportation, transfers, shore excursions and pre- and post-cruise land packages to the extent earned from sources within the U.S.

2.Exemption Under Applicable Income Tax Treaties

We believe that the U.S. source transportation income earned by Carnival plc and its subsidiaries currently qualifies for exemption from U.S. federal income tax under applicable bilateral U.S. income tax treaties.

3.U.S. State Income Tax

Carnival Corporation, Carnival plc and certain subsidiaries are subject to various U.S. state income taxes generally imposed on each state’s portion of the U.S. source income subject to U.S. federal income taxes. However, the state of Alaska imposes an income tax on its allocated portion of the total income of our companies doing business in Alaska and certain of their subsidiaries.

b.UK and Australian Income Tax

Cunard, P&O Cruises (UK) and P&O Cruises (Australia) are divisions of Carnival plc and have elected to enter UK tonnage tax under a rolling ten-year term and, accordingly, reapply every year. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on profits calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. UK corporation tax is not chargeable under the normal UK tax rules on these brands’ relevant shipping income. Relevant shipping income includes income from the operation of qualifying ships and from shipping related activities.

24

For a company to be eligible for the regime, it must be subject to UK corporation tax and, among other matters, operate qualifying ships that are strategically and commercially managed in the UK. Companies within UK tonnage tax are also subject to a seafarer training requirement.

Our UK non-shipping activities that do not qualify under the UK tonnage tax regime remain subject to normal UK corporation tax.

P&O Cruises (Australia) and all of the other cruise ships operated internationally by Carnival plc for the cruise segment of the Australian vacation region are exempt from Australian corporation tax by virtue of the UK/Australian income tax treaty.

c.Italian and German Income Tax

In 2015, Costa and AIDA re-elected to enter the Italian tonnage tax regime through 2024 and can reapply for an additional ten-year period beginning in early 2025. Companies to which the tonnage tax regime applies pay corporation taxes on shipping profits calculated by reference to the net tonnage of qualifying ships. 

Most of Costa’s and AIDA’s earnings that are not eligible for taxation under the Italian tonnage tax regime will be taxed at an effective tax rate of 4.8% in 2021 and 2020. 

Substantially all of AIDA’s earnings are exempt from German income taxes by virtue of the Germany/Italy income tax treaty. 

d.Asian Countries Income and Other Taxes

Substantially all of our brands’ income from their international operations in Asian countries is exempt from income tax by virtue of relevant income tax treaties. In addition, the income is exempt from indirect taxes in China under relevant income tax treaties and other circulars. 

e.Other

In addition to or in place of income taxes, virtually all jurisdictions where our ships call impose taxes, fees and other charges based on guest counts, ship tonnage, passenger capacity or some other measure.

XIX. Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property

We own, use and/or have registered or licensed numerous trademarks, patents and patent pending designs and technology, copyrights and domain names, which have considerable value and some of which are widely recognized throughout the world. These intangible assets enable us to distinguish our cruise products and services, ships and programs from those of our competitors. We own or license the trademarks for the trade names of our cruise brands, each of which we believe is a widely-recognized brand in the cruise industry, as well as our ship names and a wide variety of cruise products and services. 

XX. Competition

We compete with land-based vacation alternatives throughout the world, such as hotels, resorts (including all-inclusive resorts), theme parks, organized tours, casinos, vacation ownership properties, and other internet-based alternative lodging sites. Based on 2021 Cruise Industry News statistics, as of December 31, 2021, we, along with our principal cruise competitors Royal Caribbean Group, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings, Ltd. and MSC Cruises, represented approximately 80% of the cruise industry capacity, including ships operating with guests onboard and ships in pause status expected to return to guest cruise operations.
