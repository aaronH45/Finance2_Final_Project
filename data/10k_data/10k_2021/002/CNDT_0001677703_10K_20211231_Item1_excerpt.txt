Our Strategic Focus

Our vision is to become the leading business services partner of choice for businesses and governments globally. Through our dedicated associates, we deliver mission-critical services and solutions on behalf of businesses and governments, creating valuable outcomes for our clients and the millions of people who count on us. To achieve this mission and purpose, we are focused on delivering outcomes simultaneously across three dimensions: Growth, Efficiency and Quality. Our strategy is designed to deliver shareholder value by creating profitable growth, expanding operating margins, focusing on process efficiencies, and deploying a disciplined capital allocation strategy. 

We have identified specific execution strategies across Growth, Efficiency and Quality.

Growth: Our opportunity for growth comes from understanding our clients’ businesses, strengthening our relationships, and driving valuable outcomes for our clients that enable them to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and customer experience and grow their businesses. To capitalize on the growth opportunities, we are focused on the following strategies: 

•Sales Performance Optimization: The significant progress and investments in sales training and process improvements during the last couple of years, together with the foundational improvements in operational performance, have resulted in more selling opportunities for us to support the strategies of our existing clients with our portfolio of market-leading services and solutions. In 2021 our add-on sales grew by 44% compared to 2020. We continue to improve client responsiveness and increase sales coverage, including in international markets. We are providing our sales team with regular training tailored for their roles, streamlined processes, and implemented systems to equip them with modern tools that enable them to perform their jobs more efficiently and effectively. The dedication and expertise of our employees have resulted in Conduent serving 47 states and a majority of Fortune 100 companies, including:

•17 of the top 20 U.S. health insurers; 

•7 of the top 10 pharma companies;

•4 of the top 5 automakers; and

•8 of the top 10 U.S. banks. 

•Offering Development: We have augmented our portfolio of services and solutions with innovative technology capabilities, including data analytics, robotic process automation (RPA) tools and machine learning capabilities, to create differentiated, high-value services for our clients and penetrate attractive market segments.

As we continued to improve our quality and efficiency in 2021, our clients have renewed contracts with us and given us more business in adjacent service lines, and we’ve gained new clients. We are measuring more immediate success in “Growth” through revenue retention and new business signings, among other metrics.

Efficiency: We continue to find ways to reduce costs and deliver more effectively via increased efficiencies. We have simplified and standardized our operating model by removing redundant management layers and implementing more robust processes to enable faster decision-making and greater transparency. In addition, we aim to unlock further efficiencies through the following strategies:

•Automation: We will continue to invest in embedding intelligent process automation capabilities into operations, including document processing and intelligent virtual assistant customer care tools. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms will complement RPA tools by improving processes through pattern recognition. Additionally, we are exploiting synergies from sharing and coordinating automation capabilities across our enterprise. 

•Technology Consolidation: We have identified and are rationalizing duplicative technology systems across our lines of business. Centralizing technology systems will drive economies of scale, amplify the impact of investments, and will continue to strengthen consistent, resilient service delivery.

•Delivery Optimization: We are continuing to drive efficiencies by delivering common processes with a shared services model that enables economies of scale. We are driving progress in every process through process improvement methodologies and exploiting new staffing models including work from home and flexible “gig worker” models, and optimizing our geographic footprint.

We continue to respond with agility to clients’ shifting needs and have received positive client feedback for our services and proactivity throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We are measuring success in “Efficiency” by associate retention and improved adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) margin, among other metrics.

Quality: Our clients count on consistent, high-quality service delivery. We continue to drive progress in increasing uptime, improving operational stability, and significantly boosting client confidence and satisfaction by focusing on the following strategies: 

•Proactive, Real time Monitoring of Applications and Service Performance: We are investing in artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to proactively monitor and prevent incidents. We have a state-of-the-art global IT command center in Sandy, UT to deliver more seamless and reliable service to our global clients and continued to increase uptime in 2021.

•Data Center Optimization: We continue to standardize our technology footprint to improve performance and lower costs. As part of this, we have made significant progress in our data center optimization program to consolidate our multiple data centers into a select few. For example, in 2021 we closed two of our largest facilities in the US, completing these highly complex closures that in turn drove a significant increase in service availability for our clients.

•Improve End User Experience: We are improving user interface/user experience across our offerings by expanding self-service tools, launching mobile apps and leveraging analytics to create deeper insights.

Our focus on quality is leading to improved client confidence and satisfaction. The quality of our services is being recognized by clients including receiving the GM Supplier of the Year Award and the Toyota Financial Services Supplier Excellence Award. We are measuring success in “Quality” by indicators such as service level agreement performance, technology incident rates, and client satisfaction.

Investments Strategy: To achieve our business goals, we will invest in a disciplined manner, focused on allocating capital and investing to meet the needs of our clients and supporting our growth strategies. Our balanced investment approach falls into three broad categories:

•Opportunities to optimize, where we have significant scale and where we believe that with process improvements, automation, and an investment into the current offerings, we can improve the end-user experience, reduce our cost of delivery, expand our margins, and further capture additional “share”. An example is high-volume outbound contact center services.

•Opportunities to enhance, where we have strong client relationships and a long history of servicing the markets we operate in, legacy technology that needs to be refreshed or modernized. Examples such as benefit management services in the government sector for healthcare, unemployment insurance and child support fit into this category.

•Opportunities to expand, where we believe we can play and win, and we see the payback as more significant than the other businesses. These businesses, augmented with new capabilities, and with the opportunity to be supplemented by modest acquisitions, will address market dynamics, and provide additional growth opportunities. Our Healthcare and Transportation businesses are expansion opportunities.

Our Market Opportunity

We are exposed to compelling growth across several end markets, including Healthcare, Transportation and Customer Experience Management. We estimate our addressable market size in the global business process service industry to be over $200 billion in 2021, according to third-party industry reports. Many industry analysts and advisors place us as a leader across several segments in this large, diverse and growing market.

Ongoing competitive pressures and increasing demand for further productivity gains have motivated businesses and government organizations to outsource elements of their day-to-day operations to accelerate performance and improve end-user experience. As a result, our clients have become more focused on their core businesses and the range of outsourced activities has expanded. Increasing globalization has also required many companies to optimize cost structures to retain competitiveness and business process services have become a key component of this strategy.

The ongoing shift to next-generation software and automation technologies is driving greater demand for, and expectation of, efficiency and personalization by the constituents and customers of the businesses and governments we serve. Business process services that streamline operational processes have the potential to meaningfully enhance productivity for businesses and governments and improve satisfaction for their customers and constituents.

We have developed a strong leadership position in the markets that we operate in, with increased recognition across multiple stakeholders, as demonstrated by recognition from industry resources.

Table of Contents

In addition to managing HSAs, we manage Flexible Savings Accounts and other Notional Accounts on behalf of corporations providing incremental benefits to their employees.

Government Services

Our Government solutions and services include Government Healthcare Solutions and Government Service Solutions to streamline delivery of government services to constituents and families in need.

•Government Healthcare Solutions

•We provide mission-critical program administration solutions for State Medicaid and federally-funded healthcare programs in 31 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and a federal program (US Dept of Labor), which includes nearly 49 million Medicaid recipients supported. Our services include a range of innovative solutions such as Medicaid management, provider services, Medicaid business intelligence, pharmacy benefits management, eligibility and enrollment support, contact center services, application processing, premium billing, and case management solutions. Our case management solutions provide disease surveillance and outbreak management to make it easy to process and access large volumes of digital data. Foreign governments also use our disease surveillance and outbreak case management solution. This can be used to track public health metrics (such as diseases like COVID-19, vitals, and birth defects), perform electronic visit verification, and more. These services help states, counties, and countries optimize their costs by streamlining access to care and improving patient health outcomes through population health management, while helping families in need, by improving beneficiary support. Within the Government Healthcare Solutions business, our revenue is primarily fixed fee or variable price based on a per call, per interaction or per member basis. 

•Government Service Solutions

•With more than $125 billion disbursed annually, we are a leader in government payment disbursements for federally sponsored programs like Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), commonly known as food stamps and Women, Infant and Children (WIC) as well as government-initiated cash disbursements such as child support and Unemployment Insurance (UI). We deliver electronic payments for government services in 36 states, including 113 prepaid debit card programs, 24 Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) programs, 13 EBT for WIC programs and 6 Electronic Child Care programs. In our SNAP payments solution, we generate revenue based on the number of cases or number of card holders. Within our UI payment solution, we generate revenue based on interchange fees and spending on cards as a percentage of transactions. Given the increased unemployment rates in the United States earlier in the pandemic as well as the federal stimulus supplemental benefits, this solution saw significantly increased activity in 2020 and 2021.

On behalf of government agencies and authorities in the global transportation industry, we deliver fare collection, violation management, notification, mobility and payment solutions that improve automation, interoperability and decision-making to streamline operations, increase revenue and reduce congestion while creating safer communities and seamless travel experiences for consumers.

•Roadway Charging and Management Services

Our Competitive Strengths

We possess certain competitive strengths that distinguish us from our competitors, including:

Leadership in attractive growth markets – We are a leading player in business process services delivering exceptional outcomes for our clients at an unparalleled scale. Our clients continue to outsource key business processes to improve efficiencies and to accelerate performance and digital transformation. Additionally, clients are moving beyond services for back-office functions in order to drive customer satisfaction and loyalty. The increase in globalization and cost competition continues to accelerate, forcing companies to seek ways to stay ahead of the competition. These factors, along with clients and their customers demanding more personalized, seamless and secure solutions, are collectively driving the ongoing shift to next-generation solutions and services. Through our portfolio of services and solutions, we have reached significant scale in our interactions including:

•Healthcare – U.S. healthcare spending is expected to rise from 17.7% of GDP in 2019 to 19.7% of GDP by 2028 and is projected to grow at an average rate of 5.4% per year between 2019-2028. As one of the most regulated industries, healthcare providers must balance increased utilization with heightened complexity and new financial pressures such as government budget challenges to significantly reduce reimbursements, reimbursement penalties for hospital readmissions and the shift from fee-for-service to “value-based” population health management. We are widely recognized by industry analysts as a leader in healthcare payer operations, serving 17 of the top 20 U.S. health plans and providing administrative and care management solutions to Medicaid programs and federally funded U.S. government healthcare programs in 31 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Three out of every four U.S. insured lives are served by Conduent. Conduent’s healthcare capabilities have been recognized by NelsonHall, HfS Research and Everest Group.

•Transportation – Traffic congestion continues to increase as urbanization and changing demographics take hold globally. As a result, optimized transportation systems are becoming critical to increase efficiency while maintaining strict safety requirements. Electronic toll collection, public transit and parking all represent key growth drivers as governments at all levels increasingly focus on transportation infrastructure. We are an award-winning innovator in parking management. 

•Business Operations Solutions – We provide high volume print and mail services, enrollment processing and personalized and targeted marketing and communications to large corporations and are a leading provider in this market with more than 3.7 billion documents captured, indexed and classified annually. 

Global delivery expertise – Our scale and global delivery network enables us to deliver our proprietary technology, differentiated service offerings and service capabilities expertly to clients around the world. We have operations in 24 countries including India, the Philippines, Jamaica, Guatemala, Mexico, Romania, the United Kingdom and several locations within the United States, providing our customers the option for "onshore", "nearshore" or "offshore" outsourced business process services. This global delivery model enables us to leverage lower-cost production locations, consistent methodologies and processes, time zone advantages and business continuity plans. As of December 31, 2021, 50% of our employees were located in high-cost countries and 50% were located in low-cost countries.

Differentiated suite of multi-industry service offerings at scale – We manage transaction-intensive processes and work directly with end-users to meet their needs often in real-time. We believe we are unique in our ability to offer our clients these business process services on a large scale and with high quality. Additionally, we can leverage our cross-industry services to bring the same scale and quality to our portfolio of industry-specific service offerings, such as healthcare claims management, employee benefits management and public transit fare collection.

Recurring revenue model supported by a loyal, diverse client base – We have a broad and diverse base of clients in countries across geographies and industries, including 80% of the Fortune 100, many Fortune 1,000 companies, midsize businesses and governmental entities. Our close client relationships and successful client execution support our stable recurring revenue model and high renewal rates.

Competition

Although we encounter competition in all areas of our portfolio, we are a leader in many categories. We compete based on technology, performance, quality, reliability, reputation, price, and customer service and support. We consider our "onshore", “near shore” and “offshore” delivery capabilities to be a competitive advantage. Our competitors range from large international companies to relatively small firms, and many of our competitors specialize in certain areas but none compete across all the same segments in total – for example, 73 of our top 100 commercial clients buy multiple service offerings. Our competitors include:

•Large multinational service providers such as Accenture, Cognizant, TTEC and Teleperformance;

•Traditional business process outsourcing companies such as Genpact and EXL Services; 

•Human resource, payroll processing and human capital management providers such as Alight and Willis Towers Watson;

•Healthcare-focused IT and service solutions providers such as Gainwell, Optum and Maximus; 

•HSA administrators such as Health Equity;

•U.S. Federal-focused government services providers such as Leidos;

•Transportation multi-nationals such as TransCore, Thales, Cubic and Verra Mobility; and

•Smaller niche business processing service providers and in-house departments that perform functions that could be outsourced.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our business process solutions and services to both potential and existing clients through our global sales and business development teams. Additionally, we have dedicated “solution architects” who work with clients to better understand their business requirements and to develop custom-tailored solutions to meet their unique needs. Our clients include commercial businesses of many sizes and industries as well as public sector enterprises. 

Our solutions help solve clients' business issues and help them achieve their desired business outcomes. We leverage our broad portfolio of offerings and dedicated team of associates to package solutions that exactly meet clients’ needs, while taking a disciplined approach to pricing and contracting. Our sales efforts typically involve extended selling cycles where our deep domain and industry expertise is critical to winning new business. We maintain strong relationships with our clients from initial engagement to implementation and on-going service delivery.

Intellectual Property

Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. As of December 31, 2021, we own approximately 589 patents and have 59 pending applications. Our patent portfolio evolves as new patents are awarded to us and as older patents expire. These patents expire at various dates, generally 20 years from their original filing dates. While we believe that our portfolio of patents and applications has value, in general, no single patent is essential to our business or any individual segment. In addition, any of our proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or may not provide significant competitive advantages. 

Our business relies on software provided to an approximately equal extent, by both internal development and external sourcing to deliver our services. With respect to internally developed software, we claim copyright on all such software, registering works which may be accessible to third parties. In addition, we rely on maintaining source code confidentiality to assure our market competitiveness. With respect to externally sourced software, we rely on contracts assuring our continued access for our business usage.

In the United States, we own 63 registered trademarks reflecting the many businesses we participate in. These trademarks may have a perpetual life, subject to renewal every 10 years and may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. We vigorously enforce and protect our trademarks.

People and Culture

Headcount

The skills, expertise, and experience of our talented and diverse global workforce allow us to deliver mission-critical services and solutions that drive exceptional client outcomes. As of December 31, 2021, we have approximately 60,000 associates in 24 countries working towards a common vision and purpose, with 42% located in North America and the remainder located primarily in Asia Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Europe. Our three reportable segments, Commercial Industries, Government Services and Transportation, house most of our associates with approximately 42,300, 6,000 and 4,000 associates, respectively.

Conduent Diversity & Inclusion (D&I)

We draw strength from the diversity of our global workforce and we believe that creating an inclusive culture where all associates can bring their authentic selves to work creates value for all our stakeholders. 

Our Employee Impact Groups (EIG) are at the heart of our efforts to develop an inclusive workplace. In 2021, we added an eighth EIG that connects associates across generational and tenure segments, while growing overall EIG membership by over 100%. Our EIGs curated over 80 hours of cultural activities to engage our associates and promote our core value of being open and inclusive. Our EIGs have membership in every region wherein we have operations. In addition, they deployed over 20 hours of professional development activities to respond specifically to the needs of our diverse workforce. In addition, we identified leaders across the business to serve on our inaugural Global Diversity and Inclusion Council (GDIC). The newly formed GDIC has been charged with working with functional business leaders to shape the deployment of the Enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Plan. We are proud to have received several global workplace diversity awards, including our first designation as a “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality” for 2022 by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index in both the United States and its equivalent in Mexico, HRC Equidad MX.

Employee Learning and Development

As a services company, we believe our associates are our most important asset, which is why we invest in associate growth and development programs. We are focused on building a workplace where our people can do their best work and have access to the learning tools and resources they need to excel in their role, stay competitive and grow their skill set. We offer our associates modern, digital world-class learning platforms that help them learn anywhere, anytime on a wide range of topics including technology, professional and business-related. We continue to invest in new, cutting-edge learning platforms to elevate their learning experience. As a result, we have been successful in building a culture of continuous learning, with employees taking charge of their learning and development. In addition to our digital platforms, employees are also provided job-specific technical training when they are onboarded and during their professional journey as required. Our learning platforms are widely utilized with about 2.5 million learning assets completed in 2021 and have great learning effectiveness scores for satisfaction, skill improvement and application of learning on the job. We also ensure that our associates complete regulatory and compliance training on topics required based on their role and geography.  

Associate Engagement

We continuously seek and encourage feedback from our associates to inform our talent strategy and further strengthen our employee value proposition. In 2021, we sustained a high-level of engagement despite a challenging pandemic year, as indicated by our Associate Experience Survey. We saw a significant increase in overall engagement with our senior leaders across all survey categories, with 'clarity of direction' about our company and 'resources and support' to work effectively being amongst our highest scoring categories for all associates.

COVID-19 Pandemic (COVID)

As we continued to navigate the uncertainty of the pandemic in 2021, protecting the health and safety of our associates remained our top priority. Our COVID case management tracking and reporting enabled us to monitor the impacts of COVID on our workforce and workplace and protect business continuity. A small percentage of our essential workforce returned to onsite work with stringent safety protocols in place. We continued to demonstrate resiliency, agility and prudence, enabling many of our associates to shift between onsite and remote work depending on local conditions. 

We have continued taking steps to connect our associates with resources that support their health and well-being, including hosting several mental health webinars and extending our 2020 time-off plans to give our associates more

options to take time off for COVID-related sickness/hardships. Effective and constant communication regarding the state of the pandemic, local protocols and vaccine regulations has been a key element of our efforts to create the safest possible working environments for our associates. We also instituted vaccine attestation in the majority of the global geographies where we operate enabling us to understand vulnerabilities in our workforce and workplace to minimize risks during COVID spikes. The feedback from our associates continues to be positive, especially in terms of the Company’s efforts to provide a safe work environment. 

Awards and Recognition
