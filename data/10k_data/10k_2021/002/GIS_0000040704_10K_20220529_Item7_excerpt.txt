ITEM 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

 Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 

We

 are

 a

 global packaged

 foods company.

 We

 develop

 distinctive

 value-added

 food

 products

 and

 market

 them under

 unique

 brand 

names.

 We

 work

 continuously

 to

 improve

 our

 core

 products

 and

 to

 create

 new

 products

 that

 meet

 consumers’

 evolving

 needs

 and 

preferences.

 In

 addition,

 we

 build

 the

 equity

 of

 our

 brands

 over

 time

 with

 strong

 consumer-directed

 marketing,

 innovative

 new 

products,

 and

 effective

 merchandising.

 We

 believe

 our

 brand-building

 approach

 is

 the

 key

 to

 winning

 and

 sustaining

 leading

 share 

positions in markets around the globe. 

Our fundamental

 financial goal is

 to generate competitively

 differentiated returns

 for our shareholders

 over the long

 term. We

 believe 

achieving

 that

 goal

 requires

 us

 to

 generate

 a

 consistent

 balance

 of

 net

 sales

 growth,

 margin

 expansion,

 cash

 conversion,

 and

 cash 

return to shareholders over time. 

Our long-term growth objectives are to deliver the following performance

 on average over time: 

●

2 to 3 percent annual growth in organic net sales; 

●

mid-single-digit annual growth in adjusted operating profit; 

●

mid- to high-single-digit annual growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share

 (EPS); 

●

free cash flow conversion of at least 95 percent of adjusted net earnings after

 tax; and 

●

cash return to shareholders of 80 to 90 percent of free cash flow,

 including an attractive dividend yield. 

We

 are executing

 our Accelerate

 strategy to

 drive sustainable,

 profitable gro

 wth and

 top-tier shareholder

 returns over

 the long

 term.

The

 strategy

 focuses

 on

 four

 pillars

 to

 create

 competitive

 advantages

 and

 win:

 boldly

 building

 brands,

 relentlessly

 innovating, 

unleashing

 our scale,

 and

 being a

 force for

 good. We

 are prioritizing

 our core

 markets, global

 platforms,

 and

 local gem

 brands

 that 

have

 the

 best

 prospects

 for

 profitable

 growth

 and

 we

 are

 committed

 to

 reshaping

 our

 portfolio

 with

 strategic

 acquisitions

 and 

divestitures to further enhance our growth profile. 

We

 expect that

 changes in

 consumer behaviors

 driven by

 the COVID-19

 pandemic will

 result in

 ongoing elevated

 consumer demand 

for food at home, relative to pre-pandemic levels. These

 changes include more time spent working

 from home and increased consumer 

appreciation

 for cooking

 and baking.

 We

 plan to

 capitalize on

 these opportunities,

 addressing evolving

 consumer

 needs through

 our 

leading brands, innovation, and advantaged capabilities to generate profitable

 growth. 

In fiscal 2022,

 we successfully adapted

 to the volatile operating

 environment, responding quickly

 to significant increases in

 input cost 

inflation and supply chain disruptions and keeping

 our brands available for our customers and consumers.

 As a result, we were able to 

grow organic

 net sales, adjusted

 operating profit,

 and adjusted diluted

 EPS ahead of

 our initial targets.

 We

 achieved each

 of the

 three 

priorities we established at the beginning of the year:

We

 continued

 to

 compete

 effectively,

 including

 holding

 or

 growing

 market

 share

 in

 70

 percent

 of

 our

 global

 priority 

businesses.

 We

 generated organic

 net sales

 growth across

 each of

 our four

 operating segments,

 fueled by

 compelling brand 

building

 and

 innovation

 across our

 leading

 brands,

 and

 supported

 with

 strong

 levels

 of

 net price

 realization

 in

 response

 to 

significant input cost inflation. 

We

 successfully navigated

 the dynamic supply

 chain environment, which

 was characterized by

 steadily increasing input

 cost 

inflation,

 reaching

 8

 percent

 for

 the

 full

 year,

 and

 record

 levels

 of

 supply

 chain

 disruptions

 affecting

 our

 sourcing, 

manufacturing,

 and logistics

 operations.

 We

 leveraged

 our Strategic

 Revenue

 Management

 (SRM) capability

 to accelerate 

pricing actions in

 the face of increasing

 inflation, generating 7

 points of positive

 organic net price

 realization and mix

 for the 

year.

 And

 we

 moved

 quickly

 to

 address

 supply

 chain

 disruptions

 and

 outpace

 our

 competition

 in

 terms

 of

 on-shelf 

availability for our brands. 

We

 executed

 our

 portfolio

 and

 organizational

 reshaping

 actions

 without

 disrupting

 our

 base

 business.

 We

 announced

 or 

closed

 seven

 different

 acquisitions

 and

 divestitures

 during

 the

 year,

 helping

 further

 upgrade

 the

 growth

 profile

 of

 our 

portfolio.

 And we

 successfully implemented

 significant changes

 to our

 organizational

 structure, including

 streamlining our 

North

 America

 Retail

 operating

 unit

 structure,

 realigning

 our

 North

 America

 Foodservice

 segment

 and

 shifting

 our

 U.S. 

convenience stores

 business into North

 America Retail, creating

 a new International

 segment and adjusting

 our go-to-market 

model

 across

 many

 global

 markets,

 and

 establishing

 a

 new

 Strategy

 &

 Growth

 organization

 tasked

 with

 advancing

 many 

aspects of our Accelerate strategy. 

Our consolidated net

 sales for fiscal

 2022 rose 5

 percent to $19.0 billion.

 On an organic

 basis, net sales

 increased 6 percent

 compared 

to year-ago

 levels. Operating

 profit of

 $3.5 billion increased

 11 percent.

 Adjusted operating

 profit of

 $3.2 billion increased

 2 percent 

on a constant-currency

 basis.

 Diluted EPS of $4.42

 was up 17 percent

 compared to fiscal 2021

 results. Adjusted diluted EPS

 of $3.94   

18 

increased

 4

 percent

 on

 a

 constant-currency

 basis

 (See

 the

 “Non-GAAP

 Measures”

 section

 below

 for

 a

 description

 of

 our

 use

 of 

measures not defined by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)). 

Net

 cash

 provided

 by

 operations

 totaled

 $3.3 billion

 in

 fiscal

 2022

 representing

 a

 conversion

 rate

 of

 121

 percent

 of

 net

 earnings, 

including earnings attributable

 to redeemable and noncontrolling

 interests. This cash generation

 supported capital investments

 totaling 

$569 million, and

 our resulting

 free cash flow

 was $2.7 billion

 at a conversion

 rate of 113

 percent of

 adjusted net

 earnings, including 

earnings

 attributable

 to

 redeemable

 and

 noncontrolling

 interests.

 We

 returned

 cash

 to

 shareholders

 through

 dividends

 totaling

 $1.2 

billion and net share repurchases

 totaling $715 million. Our ratio

 of net debt-to-operating cash flow

 was 3.3 in fiscal 2022, and our

 net 

debt-to-adjusted earnings before net interest, income taxes, depreciation

 and amortization (net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA) ratio was 2.8 

(See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use of

 measures not defined by GAAP). 

A

 detailed

 review

 of

 our

 fiscal

 2022

 performance

 compared

 to

 fiscal

 2021

 appears

 below

 in

 the

 section

 titled

 “Fiscal

 2022 

Consolidated Results of Operations.” A detailed review

 of our fiscal 2021 performance compared to our fiscal 2020

 performance is set 

forth

 in Part

 II, Item

 7 of

 our Form

 10-K for

 the fiscal

 year

 ended

 May 30, 2021

 under the

 caption

 “Management’s

 Discussion and 

Analysis of

 Financial Condition

 and Results

 of Operations

 – Fiscal

 2021 Results

 of Consolidated

 Operations,” which

 is incorporated 

herein by reference. 

In fiscal 2023,

 we expect to

 build on our

 positive momentum

 and continue

 to advance our

 Accelerate strategy.

 Our key priorities

 are 

to

 continue

 to

 compete

 effectively,

 invest

 in

 our

 brands

 and

 capabilities,

 and

 reshape

 our

 portfolio.

 We

 expect

 the

 largest

 factors 

impacting

 our

 performance

 in

 fiscal

 2023

 will

 be

 the

 economic

 health

 of

 consumers,

 the

 inflationary

 cost

 environment,

 and

 the 

frequency and severity of disruptions

 in the supply chain.

 Total input

 cost inflation is expected to

 be approximately 14 percent

 of cost 

of goods

 sold in

 fiscal 2023.

 We

 are addressing

 the inflationary

 environment with

 holistic margin

 management (HMM)

 cost savings 

expected to

 total approximately

 3 to

 4 percent

 of cost

 of goods

 sold and

 low-double-digit net

 price realization

 generated through

 our 

SRM capability.

 We are planning

 for volume elasticities to increase but remain below

 historical levels and supply chain disruptions to 

slowly moderate in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 levels. 

Based on these assumptions, our key full-year fiscal 2023 targets are

 summarized below: 

●

Organic net sales are expected to increase 4 to 5 percent. 

●

Adjusted operating

 profit is

 expected to

 range between

 down 2

 percent and

 up 1

 percent in

 constant-currency from

 the base 

of

 $3.2

 billion

 reported

 in

 fiscal

 2022,

 including

 a

 3-point

 net

 headwind

 from

 divestitures

 and

 acquisitions

 announced

 or 

closed in fiscal 2022. 

●

Adjusted diluted EPS are

 expected to range between

 flat and up 3 percent

 in constant-currency from

 the base of $3.94 earned 

in fiscal 2022, including a 3-point net headwind from divestitures and

 acquisitions announced or closed in fiscal 2022. 

●

Free cash flow conversion is expected to be at least 90 percent of adjusted after-tax

 earnings. 

See the “Non-GAAP Measures” section below for a description of our use

 of measures not defined by GAAP.

FISCAL 2022 CONSOLIDATED

 RESULTS

 OF OPERATIONS 

In fiscal

 2022, net

 sales increased

 5 percent

 compared to

 fiscal 2021

 and organic

 net sales increased

 6 percent

 compared to

 partially 

offset

 by

 higher

 input

 costs,

 lower

 net

 corporate

 investment

 activity,

 higher

 transaction

 and

 and

 volume

 declines. 

Operating profit margin

 of 18.3 percent increased

 100 basis points.

 Adjusted operating profit

 of $3,213 million

 increased 2 percent on

Organic net sales in fiscal 2022 increased 6 percent

 compared to fiscal 2021,

 driven by favorable organic net price realization and

 mix, 

partially offset by a decrease in contributions from

 organic volume growth. 

Cost of sales 

increased $912 million in fiscal 2022

 to $12,591 million. The increase was

 primarily driven by a $1,514 million

 increase 

attributable to

 product rate and

 mix, partially offset

 by a $608

 million decrease due

 to lower volume.

 We

 recorded a

 $133 million net 

decrease

 in

 cost

 of

 sales

 related

 to

 mark-to-market

 valuation

 of

 certain

 commodity

 positions

 and

 grain

 inventories

 in

 fiscal

 2022, 

compared to a net decrease of $139

 million in fiscal 2021

 (please see Note 8 to the Consolidated

 Financial Statements in Item 8 of this 

report for additional information).

Gross margin 

decreased 1 percent in

 fiscal 2022 versus fiscal 2021.

 Gross margin as a percent

 of net sales decreased

 190 basis points 

to 33.7 percent compared to fiscal 2021.

SG&A

 expenses

 increased

 $67 million

 to

 $3,147 million

 in

 fiscal

 2022

 compared

 to

 fiscal

 2021.

 The

 increase

 in

 SG&A

 expenses 

primarily reflects

 lower net corporate

 investment activity

 and higher transaction

 costs, partially offset

 by lower media

 and advertising 

expenses and other administrative costs. SG&A expenses as a percent

 of net sales in fiscal 2022 decreased 40 basis points compared to 

fiscal 2021.   

20 

Divestitures

 gain

 totaled

 $194

 in

 fiscal

 2022

due

 to

 the

 sale

 and 

Liberté Marques

 Sàrl and

 our European

 dough businesses

 (please refer

 to Note

 3 to

 the Consolidated

 Financial Statements

 in Part

 I, 

Item 1 of this report). Divestiture loss totaled $54 million in fiscal 2021 due

 to the sale of our Laticínios Carolina business in Brazil.

Restructuring, impairment,

 and other exit

 costs (recoveries) 

totaled $26 million

 of net recoveries

 in fiscal 2022

 compared to $170 

million of charges in

 fiscal 2021. In fiscal 2022,

 we approved restructuring actions

 in the International segment

 to drive efficiencies in 

manufacturing and logistics operations

 ,

 and as a result, we

 recorded $12 million of

 charges in fiscal 2022.

 We recorded

 a net recovery 

of

 $38

 million

 in

 fiscal

 2022,

 which

 includes

 a

 $34

 million

 reduction

 to

 our

 restructuring

 reserves

 primarily

 related

 to

 severance 

charges.

 In

 fiscal

 2021,

 we

 approved

 restructuring

 actions

 designed

 to

 better

 align

 our

 organizational

 structure

 and

 resources

 with 

strategic

 initiatives

 and

 actions

 related

 to

 route-to-market

 and

 supply

 chain

 optimization.
