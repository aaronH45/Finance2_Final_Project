PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS (dollars in millions, except per share, per ounce and per pound amounts)

Introduction

Newmont Corporation is primarily a gold producer with significant operations and/or assets in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Chile, Australia and Ghana. At December 31, 2021, Newmont had attributable proven and probable gold reserves of 92.8 million ounces, measured and indicated gold resources of 68.3 million ounces and an aggregate land position of approximately 24,300 square miles (62,800 square kilometers). Newmont is also engaged in the production of copper, silver, lead and zinc. Newmont Corporation was incorporated in 1921 and completed its 100th year in 2021. As the world’s leading gold company, Newmont remains committed to creating value and improving lives through sustainable and responsible mining.

Newmont’s corporate headquarters are in Denver, Colorado, USA. In this report, “Newmont,” the “Company,” “our” and “we” refer to Newmont Corporation together with our affiliates and subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

On April 18, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Goldcorp, Inc. (“Goldcorp”) (“the Newmont Goldcorp transaction”). Results of Goldcorp for the period April 18 to December 31, 2019 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021 are included in this report. For further information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On July 1, 2019, we completed the formation of Nevada Gold Mines (“NGM”), in which we hold a 38.5% interest. As part of the formation of NGM, we contributed Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks and Long Canyon (“existing Nevada mining operations”) in exchange for our 38.5% interest. Historically, our Phoenix operations in the United States produced copper as a co-product up until the formation of NGM, effective July 1, 2019 (the “effective date”), at which point copper became a by-product. Results of our existing Nevada mining operations for the six months ended June 30, 2019 are included in this report. NGM is included for the period July 1 to December 31, 2019 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2021, which are presented at our 38.5% proportionate share, unless otherwise indicated. For further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Segment Information

Our operations are organized in five geographic regions: North America, South America, Australia, Africa and Nevada. Our North America segment consists primarily of Cripple Creek & Victor (“CC&V”) in the United States of America (“U.S.” or “USA”), Musselwhite, Porcupine and Éléonore in Canada and Peñasquito in Mexico. Our South America segment consists primarily of Yanacocha in Peru, Merian in Suriname, Cerro Negro in Argentina and our 40% equity interest in the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic. Our Australia segment consists primarily of Boddington and Tanami in Australia. Our Africa segment consists primarily of Ahafo and Akyem in Ghana. Our Nevada segment consists of our 38.5% interest in NGM. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our Nevada segment included Carlin, Phoenix, Twin Creeks and Long Canyon in the USA, which were contributed to NGM on July 1, 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 

At December 31, 2019, our Red Lake mine in our North America segment and Kalgoorlie mine in our Australia segment were held for sale and subsequently were sold in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our asset sales.

See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below, and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to our reportable segments. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information relating to domestic and export sales and lack of dependence on a limited number of customers.

Products

References in this report to “attributable” means that portion of gold, copper, silver, lead or zinc produced, sold or included in proven and probable reserves and measured, indicated and inferred resources based on our proportionate ownership, unless otherwise noted.

Gold

General. We had consolidated gold production from continuing operations of 5.9 million ounces (5.6 million attributable gold ounces) in 2021, 5.8 million ounces (5.5 million attributable gold ounces) in 2020 and 6.4 million ounces (6.0 million attributable gold ounces) in 2019. Additionally, the Pueblo Viejo mine, which is 40% owned by Newmont and accounted for as an equity method investment, produced 0.3, 0.4, and 0.3 million attributable gold ounces for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of our 2021 consolidated gold production, approximately 27% came from North America, 16% from South America, 20% from Australia, 15% from Africa and 22% from Nevada.

For 2021, 2020 and 2019, 86%, 90% and 93%, respectively, of our Sales were attributable to gold. Most of our Sales come from the sale of refined gold. The end product at our gold operations, however, is generally doré bars. Doré is an alloy consisting primarily of gold but also containing silver and other metals. Doré is sent to refiners to produce bullion that meets the required market 

5
standard of 99.95% gold. Under the terms of our refining agreements, the doré bars are refined for a fee, and our share of the refined gold and the separately-recovered silver is credited to our account or delivered to buyers. A portion of gold sold from Peñasquito in North America, Boddington in Australia and NGM and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM) in Nevada is sold in a concentrate containing other metals such as copper, silver, lead and/or zinc.

Gold Uses. Gold generally is used for fabrication or investment. Fabricated gold has a variety of end uses, including jewelry, electronics, dentistry, industrial and decorative uses, medals, medallions and official coins. Gold investors buy gold bullion, official coins and jewelry.

Gold Supply. A combination of mine production, recycling and draw-down of existing gold stocks held by governments, financial institutions, industrial organizations and private individuals make up the annual gold supply. Based on public information available, for the years 2019 through 2021, mine production has averaged approximately 75% of the annual gold supply with the remainder primarily sourced from recycled gold.

Gold Price. The following table presents the annual high, low and average daily afternoon London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”) Gold Price over the past ten years on the London Bullion Market ($/ounce):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On February 17, 2022, the afternoon LBMA gold price was $1,893 per ounce.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information on how we recognize revenue for gold sales from doré production.

Other Co-product Metals

Generally, if a metal expected to be mined represents more than 10% to 20% of the life of mine sales value of all the metal expected to be mined, the metal is considered a co-product and recognized as Sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

In 2021 and 2020, copper production at Boddington and silver, lead and zinc production at Peñasquito are considered co-products. In 2019, copper production at Boddington and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM) were considered co-products. Copper, silver, lead and zinc sales are generally in the form of concentrate that is sold to smelters for further treatment and refining.

The following table details consolidated co-product production and the percentage of Sales that was attributable to copper, silver, lead and zinc for the years ended 2021, 2020, and 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]____________________________

(1)All of our 2021 and 2020 copper co-product production came from Australia; In 2019, all of our copper co-product production came from Australia and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM).

(2)All of our 2021, 2020 and 2019 silver, lead and zinc co-product production came from North America.

6
By-product Metals

If a metal expected to be mined falls below the co-product sales value percentages, the metal is considered a by-product. Revenues from by-product sales, which are immaterial, are credited to Costs applicable to sales in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Aside from the co-product sales at Boddington and Peñasquito, copper and silver are produced as a by-product at all other Newmont sites.

Gold and Other Metals Processing Methods

Doré. Gold is extracted from naturally-oxidized ores by either milling or heap leaching, depending on the amount of gold contained in the ore, the amenability of the ore to treatment and related capital and operating costs. Higher grade oxide ores are generally processed through mills, where the ore is ground into a fine powder and mixed with water into a slurry, which then passes through a carbon-in-leach circuit to recover the gold. Lower grade oxide ores are generally processed using heap leaching. Heap leaching consists of stacking crushed or run-of-mine ore on impermeable, synthetically lined pads where a weak cyanide solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold contained within the ore. In both cases, the gold-bearing solution is then collected and pumped to process facilities to remove the gold by collection on carbon or by zinc precipitation.

Gold contained in ores that are not naturally-oxidized can be directly milled if the gold is liberated and amenable to cyanidation, generally known as free milling ores. Ores that are not amenable to cyanidation, known as refractory ores, require more costly and complex processing techniques than oxide or free milling ore. Higher grade refractory ores are processed through either roasters or autoclaves. Roasters heat finely ground ore to a high temperature, burn off the carbon and oxidize the sulfide minerals that prevent efficient leaching. Autoclaves use heat, oxygen and pressure to oxidize sulfide ores.

Some gold sulfide ores may be processed through a flotation plant. In flotation, ore is finely ground, turned into slurry, then placed in a tank known as a flotation cell. Chemicals are added to the slurry causing the gold-containing sulfides to attach to air bubbles and float to the top of the tank. The sulfides are removed from the cell and converted into a concentrate that can then be processed in an autoclave or roaster to recover the gold.

Concentrate. At Peñasquito, sulfide ore is delivered to a crushing and grinding plant which feeds a sulfide processing plant. The sulfide processing plant primarily comprises lead and zinc flotation stages. In the lead and zinc flotation, the slurry is conditioned with reagents to activate the desired minerals and produce lead and zinc concentrate. The lead concentrate is highly enriched in gold and silver, with a smaller fraction of the precious metal recovered in the zinc concentrate. The resulting concentrate is sold to smelters or traders for further processing.

At Boddington and Phoenix (until the formation of NGM), ore containing copper and gold is crushed to a coarse size at the mine and then transported via conveyor to a process plant, where it is further crushed and then finely ground as a slurry. The ore is initially treated by successive stages of flotation resulting in a copper/gold concentrate containing approximately 15% to 20% copper. The flotation tailings have a residual gold content that is recovered in a carbon-in-leach circuit.

Competition

The top 10 producers of gold comprise approximately twenty-five percent of total worldwide mined gold production. We currently rank as the top gold producer with approximately five percent of estimated total worldwide mined gold production. Our competitive position is based on the size and grade of our ore bodies anchored in favorable mining jurisdictions and our ability to manage costs compared with other producers. We have a diverse portfolio of mining operations with varying ore grades and cost structures. Our costs are driven by the location, grade and nature of our ore bodies, and the level of input costs, including energy, labor and equipment. The metals markets are cyclical, and our ability to maintain our competitive position over the long term is based on our ability to acquire and develop quality deposits, hire and retain a skilled workforce, and to manage our costs.

Licenses and Concessions

Other than operating licenses for our mining and processing facilities, there are no third party patents, licenses or franchises material to our business. In many countries, however, we conduct our mining and exploration activities pursuant to concessions granted by, or under contracts with, the host government. These countries include, among others, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Peru, Suriname, Argentina, Australia and Ghana. The concessions and contracts are subject to the political risks associated with the host country. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.

Condition of Physical Assets and Insurance

Our business is capital intensive and requires ongoing capital investment for the replacement, modernization or expansion of equipment and facilities. See “Results of Consolidated Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" within Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, for further information.

7
We maintain insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insure against risks that are typical in the operation of our business, in amounts that we believe to be reasonable. Such insurance, however, contains exclusions and limitations on coverage, particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk. There can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, below for further information.

Environmental, Social and Governance ("ESG")

ESG Overview. Focusing on leading environmental, social and governance practices has been a core part of Newmont’s business for more than 30 years. Widely recognized for our principled ESG practices, we have been consistently ranked as a leader in the mining and metal sector S&P Global, and we have been listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index (“DJSI World”) since 2007.

ESG is a key part of how we make investment decisions and central to our culture and purpose to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. Sustainability and safety are integrated into the business at all levels of the organization through our global policies, standards, strategies, business plans and remuneration plans. 

ESG Stakeholder Engagement. We engage regularly with relevant stakeholders, who we consider to be any person or organization potentially impacted by our activities or influential to our success, which allows us to gain a greater understanding of their needs, interests and perspectives while, at the same time, encouraging shared decision making to promote mutually beneficial outcomes. These engagements also inform what information is most useful for stakeholders for the purposes of our non-financial reporting. Newmont also engages with a variety of organizations at a global, regional, national and local level to adhere to high standards of governance, social and environmental policies and performance. These memberships and voluntary commitments reflect our values, support our approach to working collaboratively on best practices across several key matters and allow external stakeholders to hold us accountable. Our participation in industry initiatives, wherein we often take a leadership role, allows us to inform and influence global standards and practices, as well as gain insight into emerging expectations and issues.

ESG Reporting. We believe that transparency and accountability are key attributes of governance. Since 2003, Newmont has been reporting on how we manage the sustainability issues of relevance to stakeholders around the globe. Our sustainability report provides an annual review of non-financial performance updates on governance, strategy and management approach, risk management, and performance in key areas that include health, safety and security, workforce, the environment, supply chain, social acceptance, business integrity and compliance, value sharing, equity, inclusion and diversity domains. Our sustainability report is compiled in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's ("GRI") Standards Core option, the GRI Mining and Metals Sector Supplement, and the Value Reporting Foundation's SASB Metals & Mining standards, is externally assured, and reflects Newmont’s commitment to transparency and reporting obligations as a founding member of the International Council on Mining and Metals and as an early adopter of the United Nations ("UN") Guiding Principles Reporting Framework. 

Newmont’s sustainability reporting suite also includes our climate report, sustainability-linked bond framework, ESG data tables, conflict-free gold report, policy influence disclosures, political spending disclosures, economic impact reports, CDP (formerly, “Carbon Disclosure Project”) responses, and other reports and responses, which can be found on our website at www.newmont.com/sustainability. The information on our website, including, without limitation, in the annual sustainability report and climate report, should not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report or otherwise “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section.

Environmental Practices

Climate Change. We accept the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s ("IPCC") assessment of climate science, and we acknowledge that human activities contribute to climate change and business has an important role in addressing this global challenge. It is our firm belief that climate change is one of the greatest global challenges of our time. For a discussion of climate-related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors. 

Climate Targets and Initiatives to Achieve. As the world’s leading gold mining company, we believe that value-creation industries like mining have a responsibility to drive bold actions and innovation to transition us to a low-carbon economy. In an effort to play our part in addressing climate change, in 2020 we announced science-based, greenhouse gas reduction targets of more than 30% for Scope 1 and Scope 2 and 30% for Scope 3 by 2030, with an ultimate goal of achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. Our 2030 targets have been approved and validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), which ensures that our targets support the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels.

Since announcing our climate change targets in 2020, we have taken steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. In 2020, Newmont announced plans to significantly invest in climate change initiatives in support of our goal. As part of these initiatives, in November 2021, Newmont announced a strategic alliance with Caterpillar Inc. (“CAT”) with the aim to develop and implement a comprehensive all-electric autonomous mining system to achieve zero emissions mining. Newmont plans to provide a preliminary investment of $100 to CAT in connection with initial automation and electrification goals for surface and underground mining infrastructures and haulage fleets at Newmont’s Cripple Creek and Victor mine in Colorado and Tanami mine in Northern Territory, Australia. Other investments supporting our climate change initiatives are expected to include emissions reduction projects and renewable energy opportunities as we seek to achieve these climate targets. 

8
We also see sustainable finance as a way to further demonstrate the seriousness that Newmont puts on achieving our climate commitments. In December 2021, Newmont became the first in the mining industry to issue a sustainability-linked bond, with the registered public offering of $1 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.600% Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes due 2032 (the "Notes"), with the coupon linked to Newmont’s performance against key ESG commitments regarding 2030 emissions reduction targets and the representation of women in senior leadership roles target. In connection with the issuance of the Notes, Newmont published a Sustainability-Linked Bond Framework and obtained a second party opinion on the framework from Institutional Shareholder Services group of companies ("ISS") ESG. This follows Newmont’s decision earlier in 2021 to amend its revolving credit facility to include an interest rate margin adjustment based on the Company’s ESG external ratings. The Notes and Revolver align Newmont’s business and financing with its commitments and values by creating a direct link between its sustainability performance and funding strategies.

In addition to our focus on reducing carbon emissions, we believe that access to clean, safe water is a human right, and reliable water supplies are vital for hygiene, sanitation, livelihoods and the health of the environment. Because water is also critical to our business, we recognize the need to use water efficiently, protect water resources, and collaborate with the stakeholders within the watersheds where we operate to effectively manage this shared resource. We operate in water-stressed areas with limited supply and increasing population and water demand. Increasing pressure on water use may occur due to increased populations in and around communities in proximity to our operations. We have set annual water efficiency targets through 2023 to reduce fresh water consumption in support of our goal to achieve water stewardship.

Our Environmental Impact. Our operations span four continents in a range of ecosystems that include tropical, desert and arctic climates. We understand the impact our activities can have on the environment and are committed to protect and prevent – or otherwise minimize, mitigate and remediate – those impacts in the areas where we operate.

We conduct our operations so as to protect public health and the environment and believe our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. Our mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations in multiple jurisdictions governing the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations are continually changing and are generally becoming more restrictive.

Our Environmental Reclamation and Remediation Commitments. Each operating mine has a reclamation plan in place that meets, in all material respects, applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are also involved in several matters concerning environmental obligations associated with former, primarily historic, mining activities. Generally, these matters concern developing and implementing remediation plans at the various sites. The reclamation and remediation stage is a multifaceted process with complex risks. Successfully closing and reclaiming mines is crucial for gaining stakeholder trust and maintaining social acceptance. Notably, Newmont is committed to the implementation of the Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (“GISTM”) and all tailing storage facilities are expected to be in conformance with the GISTM by 2025. Compliance with GISTM remains on-going and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. Additionally, laws, regulations and permit requirements focused on water management and discharge requirements for operations and water treatment in connection with closure are becoming increasingly stringent. Compliance with water management and discharge quality remains dynamic and has and may continue to result in further increases to our estimated closure costs. For a discussion of the most significant reclamation and remediation activities, see Note 6 and Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For discussion of regulatory, tailings storage facilities, water, climate and other environmental risks, see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional information. 

Social Practices

Newmont’s People. At Newmont, one of the strategic pillars is people, which forms the basis of our business planning and establishes objectives by which we measure our performance. The success of our business comes from the accomplishments and well-being of our employees and contractors. Our goal is to build a workplace culture that fosters leaders and allows every person to thrive, contribute, and grow.

Approximately 14,400 people were employed by Newmont and Newmont subsidiaries and approximately 16,600 people were working as contractors in support of Newmont’s operations at December 31, 2021. Additionally, at December 31, 2021, approximately 41% of our workforce were members of a union or participated in collective bargaining. We are committed to fostering solid relationships with all members of our workforce based on trust, treating workers fairly and providing them with safe and healthy working conditions. For a discussion of related risks, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Inclusion and Diversity. The people who work on our behalf give us a competitive advantage. Through our global human capital strategy, we align our talent management efforts with the overall business strategy. The strategy’s focus areas include enhancing the employee experience and evolving for future workforce needs; building our bench strength and leadership capabilities; developing effective labor relations that align stakeholders with a shared future; and improving inclusion, including reaching gender parity. We believe that progressing an inclusive workplace culture is a critical part of tackling the challenge of attracting and retaining diverse employees. 

In 2021, we were also active participants in the Paradigm for Parity framework, a coalition of business leaders committed to a workplace where women and men have equal power, status and opportunity in senior leadership by 2030, and we are committed to advancing the UN Sustainable Development Goal to achieve gender equality. In our annual sustainability report, Newmont voluntarily reports workforce and labor information in accordance with GRI Standards, including data on workforce demographics, compensation 

9
and equal remuneration, gender diversity, union representation, labor relations, employee turnover, hiring representation, and training and development. Newmont also reports employment data in U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 reports which can be found on our website. The information in our sustainability report and on our website is not incorporated by reference in this annual report.

As discussed above, Newmont issued a sustainability-linked bond, which includes a key performance indicator ("KPI") focused on the percentage of women in senior leadership roles. Newmont commits to increase women in senior leadership roles to 50% by 2030 in line with Paradigm for Parity objectives. Women currently hold 25% of the senior leadership roles.1 

ESG Performance-based Compensation. The importance of ESG performance is emphasized with our workforce through our training and development programs and our compensation design. Employees eligible for our short-term incentive plan are held accountable for the Company’s health, safety and sustainability performance through Newmont’s performance-based compensation structure. ESG will comprise 30% of the Company’s Short-term Incentive Plan payout for 2021, with 20% allocated to health & safety metrics and 10% to sustainability performance based upon key public indices. In 2021, Newmont generated strong results in our health and safety and our sustainability measures with all sites and regions having performed above target for their critical control verifications to support fatality risk management, and significant progress on fatigue and wellbeing risk reduction plans, and increased recognition by external rating agencies. Additional information regarding the Company’s compensation programs and performance will be provided in the 2021 Proxy Statement. 

Health and Safety. We believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects. We continue to sustain robust controls at our operations and offices around the globe, including heightened levels of health screening and testing, in connection with COVID-19, as further discussed below, to protect both our workforce and the local communities in which we operate. In addition, the Company has an established Health & Safety Management System and Health, Safety and Security Standards that in most cases exceed regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The quality of our Health & Safety Management System is audited regularly as part of our assurance and governance process.

The safety of our people and the communities in which we operate is a core value; with the right to life and right to safe working conditions among our most salient human rights and key priorities. We strongly believe it is possible to effectively manage these risks, ensuring that everyone returns home safely at the end of the day. To drive a fatality, injury and illness free culture, Newmont has centered its health, safety and security activities on four key focus areas: leadership; fatality prevention; occupational health and wellness; and security threat management.

In 2021, we continued to transform our fatality risk management program resulting in over 500,000 in-field critical control verifications being undertaken, and a large proportion via our new mobile application. These verifications were undertaken by various levels of leadership who increased their visible field presence. We continued to focus on Vehicles and Driving fatality risk exposure with the implementation of minimum specifications for vehicles including buses and introduced vehicle monitoring systems (in-vehicle safety system – IVSS). Similarly, the focus on eliminating "live work" has resulted in innovative redesigning of tasks to eliminate our team's exposure to this critical risk, as well as partnering with industry peers to rapidly replicate and pilot new technology. Over 100 solutions to eliminate live work were implemented globally in 2021.

Commitments to Communities. Newmont aims to better understand both the positive and negative impacts that our activities have on host communities, and to engage impacted communities and groups to mitigate or optimize these impacts in a manner that is culturally appropriate and with the consent of those impacted. We strive to build meaningful relationships with stakeholders and recognize the need to understand, minimize and mitigate our impacts and to build long-term, positive partnerships. We also recognize our responsibility to respect and promote human rights. At our sites on or adjacent to Indigenous Peoples’ territories, we respect and acknowledge the individual and collective rights and interests of Indigenous Peoples in line with the International Labour Organization ("ILO") Convention 169 and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Governance Practices 

Board of Directors Oversight. Newmont believes that strong corporate governance, with management accountability and active oversight from an experienced Board of Directors, is essential for mitigating risk, serving in the best interests of all stakeholders and creating long-term value. The highest level of oversight at Newmont resides with Newmont’s Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Board plays a critical role, overseeing the Company’s business strategy and the overall goal of delivering long-term value creation for shareholders and other stakeholders. The members of Newmont’s Board bring a broad range of backgrounds, experiences and talents, along with ethnic, racial and gender diversity, to our governance process. As of December 31, 2021, the Board was comprised of 13 directors (12 independent non-executive directors and one executive director) with 75 percent of independent directors being either gender, ethnically or racially diverse. 

Four core Board committees, Audit, Corporate Governance and Nominating, Leadership Development and Compensation, and Safety and Sustainability, provide oversight and guidance in key areas. Each committee assists the Board in carrying out responsibilities such as assessing major risks, ensuring high standards of ethical business conduct, succession planning and talent management, and

approving and providing oversight of the sustainability strategy, which includes commitments to adoption of best practices in promotion of a healthy and safe work environment, and environmentally sound and socially responsible mining and resource development. All members of these four core Committees are independent, as defined in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and Newmont’s Corporate Governance Guidelines. More information on Newmont’s Board, governance practices and risk oversight can be found in our annual Proxy Statement. 

 Code of Conduct. Our global Code of Conduct (the “Code”), which was adopted and approved by Newmont’s Board, forms the foundation for our integrity expectations, and six overarching policies, along with our standards on Anti-Corruption, Conflicts of Interest, Gifts and Entertainment and U.S. Export Compliance, state the minimum requirements for conducting business honestly, ethically and in the best interests of Newmont. Our Code reflects our belief that as important as what we do is how we do it. It requires all representatives of Newmont to demonstrate our values – safety, integrity, sustainability, inclusion and responsibility – in every aspect of our professional lives and ultimately, to live up to our purpose, which is to create value and improve lives through sustainable and responsible mining. 

Governance Materials. Our Corporate Governance Guidelines, Proxy Statement, policies, and the charters for the Committees of Board of Directors are available on our website, www.newmont.com, and are available free of charge upon request to Investor Relations at our principal executive office. We also file with the New York Stock Exchange an annual certification that our Chief Executive Officer is unaware of any violation of the NYSE’s corporate governance standards. We make available free of charge through our website this annual report on Form 10 K, quarterly reports on Form 10 Q, current reports on Form 8 K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this report.

COVID-19 Pandemic

The outbreak of coronavirus ("COVID-19") was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in 2020. As a global business, we are committed to doing our part to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and protect people and their livelihoods. Newmont engaged its Rapid Response process early in connection with the on-going COVID-19 pandemic and continues to proactively take conservative steps to prevent further transmission. These steps have included, but are not limited to the following:

•Enforcing social distancing protocols;

•Providing flexible and remote working plans for employees;

•Increasing frequency of deep cleaning and sanitization of surfaces;

•Increasing inventory of hand sanitizer, soap and hygiene supplies; 

•Providing logistical and healthcare support to nearby communities where needed;

•Enhancing screenings at entry to sites and pre-travel and on-entry screening tests for sites in high risk locations;

•Restricting workplace access for confirmed and suspected COVID cases as well as close contacts with a confirmed case of COVID-19; and,

•Requirement for full vaccination to enter any Newmont workplace, where legally permissible.

Accordingly, vaccination rates for the workforce are high, with Yanacocha, Boddington, Tanami, Éléonore and Musselwhite sites at almost 100%, our Corporate office and Cerro Negro sites above 90% and Akyem, Ahafo, Porcupine and CC&V sites above 70% fully vaccinated. This will continue to improve as vaccination accessibility increases and mandates apply. 

Additionally, in April 2020, we established the Newmont Global Community Support Fund, a $20 fund to help host communities, governments and employees combat the COVID-19 pandemic, of which approximately $14 has been distributed through December 31, 2021. The fund is designed to focus on employee and community health, food security and local economic resilience through partnerships with local governments, medical institutions, charities and non-governmental organizations to address the greatest needs with long-term resiliency and future community development in mind.

The COVID-19 pandemic is expected to continue to evolve and challenge us in 2022. As such our practices and protocols will also continue to evolve with Newmont’s commitment to protect the health and safety of our workforce and host communities as our underlying principle. For a discussion of COVID-19 related risks to the business, see Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Refer also to “Consolidated Financial Results,” “Results of Consolidated Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis for additional information about the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations.
