Part I

Item 1. Business.

General

The Gap, Inc. (Gap Inc., the "Company", "we", and "our") is a collection of purpose-led, lifestyle brands offering apparel, accessories, and personal care products for women, men, and children under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. 

Gap Inc. is an omni-channel retailer, with sales to customers both in stores and online, through Company-operated and franchise stores, Company-owned websites, and third-party arrangements. We have Company-operated stores in the United States, Canada, Japan, Italy, China, Taiwan, and Mexico. In fiscal 2021, we signed an agreement with a third party to operate Gap Italy stores as a franchise partner beginning in fiscal 2022. We also have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta stores throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names.

In addition to operating in the specialty, outlet, online, and franchise channels, we use our omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores to further enhance the shopping experience for our customers. Our omni-channel services, including curbside pick-up, buy online pick-up in store, order-in-store, find-in-store, and ship-from-store, as well as enhanced mobile-enabled experiences, are tailored uniquely across our collection of brands.

In October 2020, the Company unveiled its Power Plan 2023 strategy, which reflects long-term plans to grow and strengthen the Company by leveraging the collective power of its four purpose-led lifestyle brands, enabling growth through competitive omni-channel capabilities and scaled operations through the power of its platform, and extending customer reach across every age, body, and occasion through the power of its portfolio. Key initiatives include:

•growing Old Navy and Athleta;

•repositioning and transforming Gap and Banana Republic;

•growing our online business;

•expanding into new categories;

•transforming cost through re-engineered capabilities; and 

•scaled strategic partnerships to amplify our reach.

In fiscal 2021, the Company’s progress against its Power Plan included:

•net openings of 32 Old Navy stores and 28 Athleta stores;

•continuing to close under-performing Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America;

•relaunching Banana Republic in the fall of 2021 to focus on affordable luxury with an elevated in-store and online experience as well as higher priced cashmere, merino, leather, and silk products; 

•continued focus on our online business and investments in automation and machine learning, which we believe will improve both the customer experience and reduce the cost of shipping and processing online orders and returns;

•launching an integrated rewards program to increase loyalty and cross-shopping across all brands;

1

•expanding the Company into new markets, new categories, and new demographics; new releases from the Yeezy Gap collaboration; the launch of Gap Home at Walmart; and promotional partnerships with athletes and celebrities at Athleta; 

•acquiring two technology companies, 3D virtual fit technology company Drapr Inc. ("Drapr") and artificial intelligence and machine learning company Context-based 4 Casting Ltd. ("CB4");

•transitioning our Company-operated stores to a franchise model in France and signing an agreement to transition our Gap stores in Italy; and

•closing our Company-operated stores in the United Kingdom and Ireland and entering into an agreement to continue serving our customers online beyond fiscal 2021 through a joint venture agreement.

We believe our continued efforts to transform our business will improve our customer experience, our overall performance, and ultimately position us for long-term growth.

Old Navy. Old Navy is an American value apparel brand that makes current essentials accessible to everyone. The brand celebrates the democracy of style through on-trend, playfully optimistic, affordable, high-quality product, and inclusive size ranges. Old Navy is committed to creating incredible shopping experiences regardless of where, when, and how customers choose to shop, including a fun store experience, a dynamic online channel, and convenient omni-channel capabilities. Old Navy opened its first store in 1994 in the United States and since has expanded to more than 1,200 stores, including Company-operated stores in Canada and Mexico and franchise stores around the world.

Old Navy believes in the power of the next generation, and through its cause platform, ONward!, supports the Boys & Girls Clubs of America to help turn learners into leaders. In 2021, Old Navy also launched BODEQUALITY, an innovative and fully inclusive shopping experience in stores and online through a human-centered design approach, to prioritize inclusive fit and style for customers.

Gap. Gap is an authority on modern American style. Founded in San Francisco in 1969, Gap continues to build on its heritage grounded in denim and khakis. Gap is a lifestyle brand that includes adult apparel and accessories, Gap Teen, Gap Kids, babyGap, Gap Maternity, Gap Body, GapFit, Yeezy Gap and Gap Home collections. In 2021, Gap introduced Gap Home, a new brand of home essentials available exclusively at Walmart. The brand connects with customers online, in Company-operated and franchise retail locations globally, and through licensing partnerships. Gap also serves value-conscious customers with exclusively designed collections for Gap Outlet and Gap Factory Stores. 

Banana Republic. Acquired in 1983 as a travel and adventure outfitter, Banana Republic is a global apparel and accessories brand committed to work for a better republic. Designed for people with purpose who share a passion for life, Banana Republic is redefining luxury by using the finest materials with the latest fabric innovations to create timeless, modern, and versatile clothing, eyewear, jewelry, shoes, handbags, and fragrances. Customers can purchase Banana Republic products globally in our specialty stores, factory stores, online, and franchise stores.

Athleta. Athleta is a premium fitness and lifestyle brand creating beautiful, technical, sustainable apparel to inspire a community of active, confident women and girls. Established in 1998 and acquired by Gap Inc. in 2008, Athleta integrates technical features and innovative design across its women's collection to carry her through a life in motion, from yoga, training and sports, to everyday activities and travel. In 2016, Athleta launched Athleta Girl, mirroring its signature performance in styles for the next generation. In 2020, Athleta introduced its first sleep collection, expanded its offerings to include inclusive sizing, and launched franchise stores in the United Kingdom, expanding its reach and bringing the brand to new customers. In 2021, Athleta continued to expand its international presence by launching the Athleta website in Canada and opening the first stores in the Canadian market.

Athleta has been certified as a benefit corporation ("B Corp"), furthering its commitment to using the business as a force for good to drive social and environmental impact. The Company met rigorous standards across social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Additionally, Athleta's legal charter was amended to become a Delaware public benefit corporation, further demonstrating its commitment to people and the planet. With this accreditation, Gap Inc. has become one of the largest publicly-traded retail companies with a B Corp certified subsidiary apparel brand.

Intermix. In May 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Intermix. We acquired Intermix in 2012. 

Janie and Jack. In April 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Janie and Jack. We acquired Janie and Jack in 2019.

Hill City. In January 2021, the Company closed the Hill City brand, which was launched in 2018. 

The range of merchandise displayed in each store varies depending on the selling season and the size and location of the store. Stores are generally open seven days per week (where permitted by law) and most holidays.

We ended fiscal 2021 with 2,835 Company-operated stores and 564 franchise store locations. For more information on the number of stores by brand and region, see the table included in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this Form 10-K.

Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta each have a private label credit card program and a co-branded credit card program through which frequent customers receive benefits. Private label and co-branded credit cards are provided by a third-party financing company, with associated revenue sharing arrangements reflected in Gap Inc. operations. In fiscal 2021, we launched a new integrated loyalty program across the U.S. and Puerto Rico to attract new customers and create enduring relationships by turning customers into lifelong loyalists. We are focused on increasing the lifetime value of our loyalty members through greater personalization. We anticipate that our integrated loyalty program will allow us to better leverage first party data and increase targeted promotions through personalization with targeted content, offers, and experiences. Although each brand expression has a different look and feel, customers can earn and redeem rewards across all of our purpose-led brands. All of our brands issue and redeem gift cards. 

Product Development

We design, develop, market, and sell a wide range of apparel, footwear and accessories products reflecting a mix of basics and fashion items based on widely accepted fashion trends, striving to bring product to market quickly and provide unrivaled value to customers. We are committed to pursuing technology and product innovation that supports our sustainability efforts while also delivering great quality products to our customers. Our product teams research, test, and iterate each season to deliver the latest styles in fabrics and silhouettes that are made to last while remaining conscious of the types of materials being sourced and the suppliers they work with. More recently, we have accelerated the adoption of digital product creation capabilities which we believe will allow us to better innovate with suppliers and reduce product design and development timelines. We also leverage feedback and purchasing data from our customer database, along with market trend insight, to guide our product and merchandising decision-making. 

Marketing and Advertising

We use a variety of marketing and advertising mediums to drive brand health, customer acquisition, and engagement. We leverage our growing customer database and respond to shopping behaviors and needs with personalized content across email, site, and digital media to drive relevance and urgency. Our diversified media mix spans traditional to digital to social media. We focus on productivity of demand generation investments to drive increased effectiveness.

Merchandise Vendors

We purchase private label and non-private label merchandise from over 250 vendors. Our vendors decreased compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the divestitures of Intermix and Janie and Jack. Our vendors have factories in approximately 25 countries. Our two largest vendors accounted for approximately 8 percent and 7 percent of the dollar amount of our total fiscal 2021 purchases. Of our merchandise purchased during fiscal 2021, substantially all purchases, by dollar value, were from factories outside the United States. Approximately 33 percent of our fiscal 2021 purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Vietnam. Approximately 16 percent of our fiscal 2021 purchases, by dollar value, were from factories in Indonesia. Product cost increases or events causing disruption of imports from Vietnam, Indonesia, or other foreign countries, including the imposition of additional import restrictions or taxes, vendors temporarily closing or potentially failing due to political, financial, or regulatory issues, public health crises such as the coronavirus disease ("COVID-19") pandemic, or supply chain disruptions, could have an adverse effect on our operations. Substantially all of our foreign purchases of merchandise are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. For additional information on risks related to our merchandise vendors, see the sections entitled "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions—The COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations," “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—Our business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing," "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—Risks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Trade matters may disrupt our supply chain” and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events" in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Seasonal Business

Our business follows a seasonal pattern, with sales peaking during the end-of-year holiday period. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have an impact on customer behavior that could result in temporary changes in the seasonality of our business. 

Brand Building

Our ability to develop and evolve our existing brands is a key to our success. We believe our distinct brands are among our most important assets. Virtually all aspects of brand development, from product design and distribution to marketing, merchandising and shopping environments, are controlled by Gap Inc. employees. We continue to invest in our business and enhance the customer experience through significant investments in our supply chain and digital capabilities, investments in marketing, and enhancement of our omni-channel shopping experience.

Trademarks and Service Marks

Old Navy, Gap, Gap Kids, babyGap, Gap Body, GapFit, Gap Teen, Banana Republic, and Athleta trademarks and service marks, and certain other trademarks and service marks, have been registered, or are the subject of pending trademark applications, with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law.

Franchising

We have franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta stores in a number of countries throughout Asia, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. For additional information on risks related to our franchise business, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our franchise and licensing businesses are subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Inventory

The nature of the retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we, along with other retailers, generally build up inventory levels. We maintain a large part of our inventory in distribution centers. We review our inventory levels in order to identify slow-moving merchandise and broken assortments (items no longer in stock in a sufficient range of sizes or colors) and we primarily use promotions and markdowns to clear merchandise. For additional information on risks related to our inventory, see the sections entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Brand Relevance and Brand Execution—We must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed,” "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Operating a Global Business—Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events" in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K. 

Competitors

The global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We compete with local, national, and global apparel retailers. For additional information on risks related to competition, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Competition—Our business is highly competitive” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Human Capital

As of January 29, 2022, we had a workforce of approximately 97,000 employees. We also hire seasonal employees, primarily during the peak holiday selling season. As of January 29, 2022, approximately 81 percent of employees worked in retail locations, approximately 9 percent of employees worked in headquarters locations, and approximately 10 percent of employees worked in distribution centers. In addition, as of that date, approximately 81 percent of employees were located in the U.S. and approximately 19 percent of employees were located outside of the U.S., with a majority of those non-U.S. based employees located in Canada, Asia, and Europe.

We know that in order to remain competitive in the retail apparel industry, we must attract, develop, and retain skilled employees in our design, merchandising, supply chain, marketing, information technology, and other functions, as well as in our stores and distribution centers. Competition for such personnel is intense. Our success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key employees. We understand the importance of human capital and prioritize building talent; diversity, equity and inclusion; ensuring pay equity; gathering employee feedback; and protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers, and communities.

Building Talent. We invest in our employees through accessible resources and structured training programs that offer all employees opportunities for development. We create, manage or offer a large collection of courses for employees that cover a range of subjects such as goal setting, how to be an effective leader, situational leadership, unconscious bias and inclusive leadership, and effective communication. In addition, through a virtual platform, employees ranging from Manager to Vice President can connect with experienced coaches to receive customized guidance that takes into account each participant's unique situation. We also offer a LinkedIn Learning program providing employees with access to micro-courses on topics from strategic thinking and mental agility, to equality and belonging and communicating with confidence.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We offer our employees extensive programs and resource groups that foster diversity and inclusion. In addition, we have established nine Company-wide commitments to foster racial justice. We are also committed to greater transparency and have publicly reported our global employee gender data and overall U.S. race and ethnicity data since 2007, and in fiscal 2021 we shared additional data on how our employees identify their race and ethnicity at stores, distribution and call centers and headquarters. In fiscal 2021, we also published our first dedicated Equality & Belonging Report to talk openly about our progress and the lessons we have learned along the way.

Pay Equity. Since 2014, we have conducted annual reviews of our pay data by gender, and in 2020, we began using an external firm to assess our pay data by race for all U.S. employees.

Employee Feedback. We value our employees' feedback and use opinion surveys as a critical component of our ongoing listening strategy. We use these insights to understand what is important to our employees and to determine where we should focus our investments and build new programs and strategies that help us create a thriving, productive work environment. We have modernized our approach to soliciting employee feedback, shifting from an annual Company-wide opinion survey to more frequent pulse surveys on topical issues. This allows us to capture real-time data so we can understand and respond faster to employees' immediate needs. We now issue monthly surveys to representative samples of employees based on the topic, with an aim to have all employees participate in at least one survey every quarter.

Health and Safety. Protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers and communities is a top priority. In 2020, we committed to evolving our health and safety practices in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as we safely reopened stores with a strategic plan to deliver a safe shopping experience for our communities. In 2021, we launched on-site COVID-19 vaccination clinics at certain U.S. distribution centers. We are committed to following strict safety protocols in our stores, offices and distribution centers based on recommendations from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization, as well as federal, state and local government mandates.

Human Capital Oversight. The Board of Directors and its Compensation and Management Development Committee oversee human capital issues. The Compensation and Management Development Committee has formal oversight over the Company's policies and strategies relating to its human capital management, including policies, processes and strategies relating to employee recruitment, retention and development of management resources; executive personnel appraisal, development and selection; talent management; workforce diversity; and compensation, workplace and employment practices, as outlined in its charter. The Committee regularly receives reports on talent, succession planning, and diversity and inclusion. On a quarterly basis, the Committee receives a talent dashboard with key metrics, including employee survey feedback and turnover information. The Committee engages periodically on compensation program design for all employees at all levels.

For additional information on risks related to our human capital management, see the section entitled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management—Our failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely impact our results of operations” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Form 10-K.

Government Regulation

As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position as compared to prior periods.
