ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

The following factors should be considered when reviewing our business. These factors could have a material adverse impact on our business, prospects, financial position, results of operations or cash flows and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed elsewhere in this report.

In August 2021, PSEG entered into two agreements to sell PSEG Power’s 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio to newly formed subsidiaries of ArcLight Energy Partners Fund VII, L.P., a fund controlled by ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC. In February 2022, we completed the sale of this fossil generating portfolio. As a result, risks described in this Item 1A and otherwise in this document that relate solely to this 6,750 MW fossil generating portfolio, except for those related to certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale transactions, primarily for obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the Connecticut Transfer Act, are no longer relevant to our business. 

GENERAL OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS

Inability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, or construct T&D, and solar and wind generation projects could adversely impact our businesses.

Our business plan calls for extensive investment in capital improvements and additions, including the construction of T&D facilities, modernizing existing infrastructure pursuant to investment programs that provide for current recovery in rates, and our CEF programs, which include providing incentives for customers to install high-efficiency equipment at their premises, constructing EV infrastructure, and implementing our smart meter program. Currently, we have several significant projects underway or being contemplated. 

The successful construction and development of these projects will depend, in part, on our ability to:

•obtain necessary governmental and regulatory approvals; 

•obtain environmental permits and approvals; 

•obtain community support for such projects to avoid delays in the receipt of permits and approvals from regulatory authorities;

•obtain customer support for investments made at their premises;

•complete such projects within budgets and on commercially reasonable terms and conditions; 

•complete supporting information technology upgrades;

•obtain any necessary debt financing on acceptable terms and/or necessary governmental financial incentives; 

•ensure that contracting parties, including suppliers, perform under their contracts in a timely and cost effective manner; and

•recover the related costs through rates.

Any delays, cost escalations or otherwise unsuccessful construction and development could materially affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

In addition, the successful operation of new solar or wind or upgraded generation facilities or transmission or distribution projects is subject to risks relating to supply interruptions; labor availability, work stoppages and labor disputes; weather interferences; unforeseen engineering and environmental problems, including those related to climate change; opposition from local communities, and the other risks described herein. Further, negative public and political views on natural gas could result in diminishing political support for utility investments in gas infrastructure.

Any of these risks could cause our return on these investments to be lower than expected or they could cause these facilities to operate below intended targets, which could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations through lost revenue and/or increased expenses.

We are subject to physical, financial and transition risks related to climate change, including potentially increased legislative and regulatory burdens and changing customer preferences, and we may be subject to lawsuits, all of which could impact our businesses and results of operations. 

Climate change may increasingly drive change to existing or additional legislation and regulation that may impact our business and shape our customers’ energy preference and sustainability goals. While the CIP protects margin variances against changes in customer usage of gas and electricity, customer demand for our gas could decrease as a result of changing customer preferences favoring electrification and advanced technologies that offer energy efficient options. Electric usage could also be impacted by greater adoption of EVs, installation of distributed energy resources, such as behind the meter solar, installation of 

22
more energy efficient equipment, flexible load and/or energy storage, and other advances in technology. Further, climate change may adversely impact the economy and reduced economic and consumer activity in our service areas could reduce demand for electricity and gas we deliver. Fluctuations in weather can also affect demand for our services. For example, milder than normal weather can reduce demand for electricity and gas distribution services. All of these factors could impact the need to invest in our electric and gas T&D systems and, therefore, the rate of growth of our company. 

Severe weather or acts of nature, including hurricanes, winter storms, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters can stress systems, disrupt operation of our facilities and cause service outages, production delays and property damage that require incurring additional expenses. These and other physical changes could result in changes in customer demand, increased costs associated with repairing and maintaining generation facilities and T&D systems, resulting in increased maintenance and capital costs (and potential increased financing needs), increased regulatory oversight, and lower customer satisfaction. Where recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged equipment and facilities is available, any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, our ability to access capital markets could be negatively affected or cause us to receive less than ideal terms and conditions.

Climate change-related political pressure and policy goals, including but not limited to those related to energy efficient targets, solar targets, encouragement of electrification through EV adoption, home heating, and the associated legislative and regulatory responses, may create financial risk as our operations may be subject to additional regulation at either the state or federal level in the future. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on our electric and natural gas operations, and our suppliers. Developing and implementing plans for compliance with GHG emissions reduction, clean/renewable energy requirements, or for achieving voluntary climate commitments can lead to additional capital, personnel, and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) expenditures and could significantly affect the economic position of existing operations and proposed projects. If our regulators do not allow us to recover all or a part of the cost of capital investment or the O&M costs incurred to comply increasingly rigorous regulatory mandates, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. On the other hand, in the event that the political, policy, regulatory or legislative support for clean energy projects declines, the benefits or feasibility of certain investments we may have made in such projects, including those in the development stage, may be reduced. 

We may be subject to climate change lawsuits that may seek injunctive relief, monetary compensation, and punitive damages, including but not limited to, for liabilities for personal injuries and property damage caused by climate change. An adverse outcome could require substantial capital expenditures and possibly require payment of substantial penalties or damages. Defense costs associated with such litigation can also be significant and could affect results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if such costs are not recovered through regulated rates.

We may be adversely affected by asset and equipment failures, critical operating technology or business system failures, accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, cyberattack, or other incidents, including pandemics such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, that impact our ability to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and remain competitive and could result in substantial financial losses.

The success of our businesses is dependent on our ability to continue providing safe and reliable service to our customers while minimizing service disruptions. We are exposed to the risk of asset and equipment failures, accidents, natural disasters, severe weather events, acts of war or terrorism, sabotage, cyberattack or other incidents, which could result in damage to or destruction of our facilities or damage to persons or property and to gas supply interruptions. Further, a major failure of availability or performance of a critical operating technology or business system, and inadequate preparation or execution of business continuity or disaster recovery plans for the loss of one or several critical systems, could result in extended disruption to operations or business processes, damage to systems and/or loss of data. 

We are also exposed to the risk of pandemics, such as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, which could result in service disruptions and delay or otherwise impair our ability to timely provide service to our customers or complete our investment projects.

These events could result in increased political, economic, financial and insurance market instability and volatility in power and fuel markets, which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations, including our ability to access capital on terms and conditions acceptable to us.

In addition, climate change will exacerbate the physical risks to our facilities and operations resulting from such climate hazards as more severe weather events (extreme wind, rainfall and flooding), such as experienced from Superstorm Sandy and Tropical Storms Isaias and Ida, sea level rise, and extreme heat. Such issues experienced at our facilities, or by others in our industry, could adversely impact our revenues; increase costs to repair and maintain our systems; subject us to potential litigation and/or damage claims, fines or penalties; and increase the level of oversight of our utility and generation operations and infrastructure 

23
through investigations or through the imposition of additional regulatory or legislative requirements. Such actions could adversely affect our costs, competitiveness and future investments, which could be material to our financial position, results of operations and cash flow. For our T&D business, the cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. In addition, the inability to restore power to our customers on a timely basis could result in negative publicity and materially damage our reputation. 

Any inability to recover the carrying amount of our long-lived assets could result in future impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Long-lived assets represent approximately 70% and 83% of the total assets of PSEG and PSE&G, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. Management evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, including a disallowance of certain costs, business climate or market conditions, including prolonged periods of adverse commodity and capacity prices, could potentially indicate an asset’s or group of assets’ carrying amount may not be recoverable. Significant reductions in our expected revenues or cash flows for an extended period of time resulting from such events could result in future asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Disruptions or cost increases in our supply chain, including labor shortages, could materially impact our business.

The supply chain of goods and services is currently being negatively impacted by several factors, including manufacturing labor shortages, domestic and international shipping constraints, increases in demand, and shortages of raw materials and specialty components. As a result, we are seeing price increases in some areas and delivery delays of certain goods. These factors have increased our costs and have the potential to impact our operations. We cannot currently estimate the potential impact of continued supply chain disruptions but they could materially impact our business and results of operations. 

Inability to maintain sufficient liquidity in the amounts and at the times needed or access sufficient capital at reasonable rates or on commercially reasonable terms could adversely impact our business.

Funding for our investments in capital improvement and additions, scheduled payments of principal and interest on our existing indebtedness and the extension and refinancing of such indebtedness has been provided primarily by internally-generated cash flow and external debt financings. We have significant capital requirements and depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from our operations and continued access to capital and bank markets to efficiently fund our cash flow needs. Our ability to generate cash flow is dependent upon, among other things, industry conditions and general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. The ability to arrange financing and the costs of such financing depend on numerous factors including, among other things. 

•general economic and capital market conditions, including but not limited to, prevailing interest rates;

•the availability of credit from banks and other financial institutions;

•tax, regulatory and securities law developments; 

•for PSE&G, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for the incurrence of additional indebtedness;

•investor confidence in us and our industry;

•our current level of indebtedness and compliance with covenants in our debt agreements;

•the success of current projects and the quality of new projects;

•our current and future capital structure; 

•our financial performance and the continued reliable operation of our business; and

•maintenance of our investment grade credit ratings.

Market disruptions, such as economic downturns experienced in the U.S. and abroad, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company or a systemically important financial institution, changes in market prices for electricity and gas, and actual or threatened acts of war or terrorist attacks, may increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access capital. As a result, no assurance can be given that we will be successful in obtaining financing for projects and investments, to extend or refinance maturing debt or for our other cash flow needs on acceptable terms or at all, which could materially adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and future growth.

In addition, if PSEG Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody’s, it would be required under certain agreements to provide a significant amount of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows.

24
Cybersecurity attacks or intrusions or other disruptions to our information technology, operational or other systems could adversely impact our businesses.

Cybersecurity threats to the energy market infrastructure are increasing in sophistication, magnitude and frequency, particularly since COVID-19 and the resulting shift to virtual operations began. Because of the inherent vulnerability of infrastructure and technology and operational systems to disability or failure due to hacking, viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service attacks, ransomware, acts of war or terrorism, or other cybersecurity incidents, we face increased risk of cyberattack. We rely on information technology systems and network infrastructure to operate our generation and T&D systems. We also store sensitive data, intellectual property and proprietary or personally identifiable information regarding our business, employees, shareholders, customers and vendors on our systems and conduct power marketing and hedging activities. In addition, the operation of our business is dependent upon the information technology systems of third parties, including our vendors, regulators, RTOs and ISOs, among others. Our and third-party information technology systems and products may be vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks involving fraud, malice or oversight on the part of our employees, other insiders or third parties, whether domestic or foreign sources. A cybersecurity attack may also leverage such information technology to cause disruptions at a third party. Cybersecurity impacts to our operations include:

•disruption of the operation of our assets, the fuel supply chain, the power grid and gas T&D,

•theft of confidential company, employee, shareholder, vendor or customer information, and critical energy infrastructure information, which may cause us to be in breach of certain covenants and contractual or legal obligations, 

•general business system and process interruption or compromise, including preventing us from servicing our customers, collecting revenues or the ability to record, process and/or report financial information correctly, and

•breaches of vendors’ infrastructures where our confidential information is stored.

We and our third-party vendors have been and will continue to be subject to cybersecurity attacks, including but not limited to ransomware, denial of service, and malware attacks. While there has been no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks to date, we may be unable to prevent all such attacks in the future from having such a material impact as such attacks continue to increase in sophistication and frequency. If a significant cybersecurity event or breach occurs within our company or with one of our material vendors, we could be exposed to significant loss of revenue, material repair costs to intellectual and physical property, significant fines and penalties for non-compliance with existing laws and regulations, significant litigation costs, increased costs to finance our businesses, negative publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of confidence from our customers, regulators, investors, vendors and employees. The misappropriation, corruption or loss of personally identifiable information and other confidential data from us or one of our vendors could lead to significant breach notification expenses, mitigation expenses such as credit monitoring, and legal and regulatory fines and penalties. Moreover, new or updated security laws or regulations or unforeseen threat sources could require changes in current measures taken by us and our business operations, which could result in increased costs and adversely affect our financial statements. Similarly, a significant cybersecurity event or breach experienced by a competitor, regulatory authority, RTO, ISO, or vendor could also materially impact our business and results of operations via enhanced legal and regulatory requirements. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain against losses that result from cybersecurity incidents may not be sufficient to cover losses or adequately compensate for resulting business disruptions. For a discussion of state and federal cybersecurity regulatory requirements and information regarding our cybersecurity program, see Item 1. Business—Regulatory Issues—Cybersecurity.

Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

In response to the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic, we have implemented a comprehensive set of actions to help our customers, communities and employees, and will continue to closely monitor developments and adjust as needed to ensure reliable service while protecting the safety and health of our workforce and the communities we serve.

PSE&G, PSEG Power and PSEG LI are providing essential services during this national emergency related to the coronavirus pandemic. The pandemic’s potential impact will depend on a number of factors outside of our control, including the duration and severity of the outbreak as well as third-party actions, including governmental requirements, taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. We currently cannot estimate the potential impact the ongoing coronavirus pandemic may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. However a prolonged outbreak and associated government and regulatory responses, including the long-term impact they may have on the economy, which could extend beyond the duration of the pandemic, could affect, among other things:

•the timing of our planned capital programs, including the ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our capital programs;

25
•PSE&G’s residential and C&I customer payment patterns, in part as residential customer non-safety related service disconnections for non-payment have been temporarily suspended, resulting in adverse impacts to accounts receivable and bad debt expense;

•the recovery of incremental costs incurred related to the pandemic, including higher bad debts;

•the availability of capital markets and credit from banks and other financial institutions to fund our operations and capital programs and the cost of borrowing and available terms;

•the availability and productivity of skilled workers and contractors to operate our facilities;

•the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us;

•the potential for assessment of impairment of our long-lived assets;

•financial market performance that adversely impacts asset values in our pension and Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) funds, adversely impacts Net Income and potentially increases related funding requirements; and

•the availability of materials and supplies due to supply chain interruptions.

Any failure or breach of these systems would have a material impact on our business and results of operations.

Failure to attract and retain a qualified workforce could have an adverse effect on our business. 

Certain events such as an aging workforce without adequate workforce plans and replacements, a lack of skill set to complement evolving business needs, a culture that does not foster inclusion, a labor strike and unavailability of resources due to health impacts or protocol mandates related to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include loss of knowledge and a lengthy time period associated with skill development, increased turnover, costs for contractors to replace employees, and productivity and safety costs. Specialized knowledge is required of the technical and support employees for our carbon-free infrastructure investments and generation and T&D operations. There is competition and a tightening market for skilled employees. Failure to hire and adequately train and retain employees, including the transfer of significant historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 

Increases in the costs of equipment and materials, fuel, services and labor could adversely affect our operating results.

Inflation has recently increased across the economy and is impacting portions of our business. Higher costs from suppliers of equipment and materials, fuel, services and labor costs to attract and retain our workforce, could lead to increased costs, which could reduce our earnings. Also, seeking recovery of higher costs in future rate cases could pressure customer rates, resulting in a potentially adverse outcome of such proceedings, or in other proceedings, including the proposal of certain investment programs or other proceedings that impact customer rates.

Covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business.

PSEG’s and PSE&G’s fixed income debt instruments contain events of default customary for financings of their type, including cross accelerations to other debt of that entity and, in the case of PSEG’s, PSE&G’s and PSEG Power’s bank credit agreements, certain change of control events and certain limitations on the incurrence of liens. PSEG Power’s bank credit agreements also contain limitations on the incurrence of subsidiary debt. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we fail to comply with the covenants and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment, or a default exists and is continuing under such debt, the lenders or the holders or trustee of such debt, as applicable, could give notice and declare outstanding borrowings and other obligations under such debt immediately due and payable. We may not be able to obtain waivers, amendments or alternative financing, or if obtainable, it could be on terms that are not acceptable to us. Any of these events could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Financial market performance directly affects the asset values of our Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Fund and defined benefit plan trust funds. Market performance and other factors could decrease the value of trust assets and could result in the need for significant additional funding.

The performance of the financial markets will affect the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy our future obligations under our defined benefit plans and to decommission our nuclear generating plants. A decline in the market value of our NDT Fund could increase PSEG Power’s funding requirements to decommission its nuclear plants. A decline in the market value of the defined benefit plan trust funds could increase our pension plan funding requirements. The market value of our trusts could be negatively impacted by decreases in the rate of return on trust assets, decreased interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels and future government regulation. Additional funding requirements for our defined benefit plans could be caused by changes in required or voluntary contributions, an increase in the number of employees becoming eligible to retire and changes in life expectancy assumptions. Increased costs could also lead to additional funding requirements for our 

26
decommissioning trust. Failure to manage adequately our investments in our NDT Fund and defined benefit plan trusts could result in the need for us to make significant cash contributions in the future to maintain our funding at sufficient levels, which would negatively impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR GENERATION BUSINESS

Failure to complete, or delays in completing, our proposed investment in the Ocean Wind project could adversely impact our businesses and prospects.

In December 2020, PSEG entered into a definitive agreement with Ørsted North America to acquire a 25% equity interest in Ørsted’s Ocean Wind project. On March 31, 2021, the BPU approved PSEG’s investment in Ocean Wind and the acquisition was completed in April 2021.

Our ability to realize the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of these projects is subject to a number of risks, challenges and uncertainties, including, among others:

•the risk that we or Ørsted may determine not to proceed with the project at certain milestones in the development of the project, in accordance with the terms of the transaction documents;

•the fact that, subject to certain investment decision milestones, we will be obligated to fund our proportionate share of future capital expenditures in respect of the project, and such future capital expenditures may be greater than expected as a result of, among other things, potential timing delays, cost overruns, labor disputes or unanticipated liabilities;

•the risk that there may be changes to the tax laws, rules and interpretations applicable to a project, including the risk of any reduction, elimination or expiration of government incentives for wind energy or otherwise that may adversely affect such project’s ability to realize certain anticipated tax benefits and, by extension, our ability to realize a satisfactory return on our investment in the project, including in our capacity as a tax equity investor;

•certain limitations on our ability to influence and control strategic decisions related to the project given our status as a minority investor, and the possibility that we and Ørsted may have different views and priorities regarding the development, construction and operation of the project, as well as other risks and uncertainties inherent in joint venture arrangements; 

•risks inherent in entering into a new line of business, offshore wind, in which we have not historically operated, and which may expose us to business and operational risks and liabilities that are different from those we have experienced historically and that may be more difficult to manage given our limited operational experience and resources in this area;

•the risk that we may fail to obtain or maintain, on acceptable terms or at all, any required licenses, permits and other regulatory or third party approvals, or may encounter other environmental or regulatory compliance issues, in connection with the project; and

•the risk of catastrophic events, including damage to project equipment, caused by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters.

If any such risks or other anticipated or unanticipated liabilities were to materialize, the anticipated benefits of a project may not be fully realized, if at all, and the future performance of the project and our investment therein, as well as our financial condition and results of operations, may be materially and adversely impacted.

Further, as the offshore wind market matures, it may attract more capital and competition and potentially lower the rate of return on any offshore wind projects we are involved in.

Fluctuations in the wholesale power and natural gas markets could negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In the markets where we operate, natural gas prices have a major impact on the price that generators receive for their output. Over the past several years, wholesale prices for natural gas have remained well below the peak levels experienced in 2008, in part due to increased shale gas production as extraction technology has improved. Lower gas prices have resulted in lower electricity prices, which have reduced our margins as nuclear generation costs have not declined similarly. Recently, the natural gas market, and therefore energy markets have become more volatile, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. 

We may be unable to obtain an adequate fuel supply in the future.

We obtain substantially all of our physical natural gas and nuclear fuel supply from third parties pursuant to arrangements that vary in term, pricing structure, firmness and delivery flexibility. Our fuel supply arrangements must be coordinated with 

27
transportation agreements, balancing agreements, storage services and other contracts to ensure that the natural gas and nuclear fuel are delivered to our power plants at the times, in the quantities and otherwise in a manner that meets the needs of our generation portfolio and our customers. We must also comply with laws and regulations governing the transportation of such fuels.

We are exposed to increases in the price of natural gas and nuclear fuel, and it is possible that sufficient supplies to operate our generating facilities profitably may not continue to be available to us. Significant changes in the price of natural gas and nuclear fuel could affect our future results and impact our liquidity needs. In addition, we face risks with regard to the delivery to, and the use of natural gas and nuclear fuel by, our power plants including the following:

•transportation may be unavailable if pipeline infrastructure is damaged or disabled;

•pipeline tariff changes may adversely affect our ability to, or cost to, deliver such fuels;

•creditworthiness of third-party suppliers, defaults by third-party suppliers on supply obligations and our ability to replace supplies currently under contract may delay or prevent timely delivery;

•market liquidity for physical supplies of such fuels or availability of related services (e.g. storage) may be insufficient or available only at prices that are not acceptable to us;

•variation in the quality of such fuels may adversely affect our power plant operations;

•legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including those related to pipeline integrity inspections, may increase the cost of such fuels;

•fuel supplies diverted to residential heating may limit the availability of such fuels for our power plants; and 

•the loss of critical infrastructure, acts of war or terrorist attacks (including cybersecurity breaches) or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, severe storms or other similar occurrences could impede the delivery of such fuels.

Our nuclear units have a diversified portfolio of contracts and inventory that provide a substantial portion of our fuel raw material needs over the next several years. However, each of our nuclear units has contracted with a single fuel fabrication services provider, and transitioning to an alternative provider could take an extended period of time. Certain of our other generation facilities also require fuel or other services that may only be available from one or a limited number of suppliers. The availability and price of this fuel may vary due to supplier financial or operational disruptions, transportation disruptions, force majeure and other factors, including market conditions. At times, such fuel may not be available at any price, or we may not be able to transport it to our facilities on a timely basis. In this case, we may not be able to run those facilities even if it would be profitable. If we had sold forward the power from such a facility, we could be required to supply or purchase power from alternate sources, perhaps at a loss. This could have a material adverse impact on our business, the financial results of specific plants and on our results of operations. 

Although our fuel contract portfolio provides a degree of hedging against these market risks, such hedging may not be effective and future increases in our fuel costs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. While our generation runs on a mix of fuels, primarily natural gas and nuclear fuel, an increase in the cost of any particular fuel ultimately used could impact our results of operations.

Operation of our generating stations are subject to market risks that are beyond our control.

Generation output will either be used to satisfy wholesale contract requirements or other bilateral contracts or be sold into competitive power markets. Participants in the competitive power markets are not guaranteed any specified rate of return on their capital investments. Generation revenues and results of operations are dependent upon prevailing market prices for energy, capacity, ancillary services and fuel supply in the markets served. Changes in prevailing market prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Factors that may cause market price fluctuations include:

•increases and decreases in generation capacity, including the addition of new supplies of power as a result of the development of new power plants, expansion of existing power plants or additional transmission capacity;

•power transmission or fuel transportation capacity constraints or inefficiencies;

•power supply disruptions, including power plant outages and transmission disruptions;

•climate change and weather conditions, particularly unusually mild summers or warm winters in our market areas;

•seasonal fluctuations;

28
•economic and political conditions that could negatively impact the demand for power;

•changes in the supply of, and demand for, energy commodities;

•development of new fuels or new technologies for the production or storage of power;

•federal and state regulations and actions of the ISOs; and

•federal and state power, market and environmental regulation and legislation, including financial incentives for new renewable energy generation capacity that could lead to oversupply.

Our generation business frequently involves the establishment of forward sale positions in the wholesale energy markets on long-term and short-term bases. To the extent that we have produced or purchased energy in excess of our contracted obligations, a reduction in market prices could reduce profitability. Conversely, to the extent that we have contracted obligations in excess of energy we have produced or purchased, an increase in market prices could reduce profitability. If the strategy we utilize to hedge our exposure to these various risks or if our internal policies and procedures designed to monitor the exposure to these various risks are not effective, we could incur material losses. Our market positions can also be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the energy markets that, in turn, depends on various factors, including weather in various geographical areas, short-term supply and demand imbalances, customer migration and pricing differentials at various geographic locations. These risks cannot be predicted with certainty.

Increases in market prices also affect our ability to hedge generation output and fuel requirements as the obligation to post margin increases with increasing prices.

The introduction or expansion of technologies related to energy generation, distribution and consumption and changes in customer usage patterns could adversely impact us.

The power generation business has seen a substantial change in the technologies used to produce power. Newer generation facilities are often more efficient than aging facilities, which may put some of these older facilities at a competitive disadvantage to the extent newer facilities are able to consume the same or less fuel to achieve a higher level of generation output. Federal and state incentives for the development and production of renewable sources of power have facilitated the penetration of competing technologies, such as wind, solar, and commercial-sized power storage. Additionally, the development of DSM and energy efficiency programs can impact demand requirements for some of our markets at certain times during the year. The continued development of subsidized, competing power generation technologies and significant development of DSM and energy efficiency programs could alter the market and price structure for power generation and could result in a reduction in load requirements, negatively impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of energy efficiency in end-use electric devices or other improvements in, or applications of, technology could also lead to declines in per capita energy consumption. 

Advances in distributed generation technologies, such as fuel cells, micro turbines, micro grids, windmills and net-metered solar installations, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing electricity to a level that is competitive with that of most central station electric production. Large customers, such as universities and hospitals, continue to explore potential micro grid installation. Certain states, such as Massachusetts and California, are also considering mandating the use of power storage resources to replace uneconomic or retiring generation facilities. Such developments could (i) affect the price of energy, (ii) reduce energy deliveries as customer-owned generation becomes more cost-effective, (iii) require further improvements to our distribution systems to address changing load demands, and (iv) make portions of our transmission and/or distribution facilities obsolete prior to the end of their useful lives. These technologies could also result in further declines in commodity prices or demand for delivered energy.

Some or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers, and may cause us to fail to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These factors could also materially affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial positions through, among other things, reduced operating revenues, increased O&M expenses, and increased capital expenditures, as well as potential asset impairment charges or accelerated depreciation and decommissioning expenses over shortened remaining asset useful lives.

We are subject to third-party credit risk relating to our sale of generation output and purchase of fuel.

We sell generation output and buy fuel through the execution of bilateral contracts. We also seek to contract in advance for a significant proportion of our anticipated output capacity and fuel needs. These contracts are subject to credit risk, which relates to the ability of our counterparties to meet their contractual obligations to us. Any failure of these counterparties to perform could require PSEG Power to purchase or sell energy or fuel in the wholesale markets at less favorable prices and incur additional losses, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. In the spot markets, we are exposed to the risks of the default sharing mechanisms that exist in those markets, some of which 

29
attempt to spread the risk across all participants. Therefore, a default by a third party could increase our costs, which could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. 

There may be periods when PSEG Power may not be able to meet its commitments under forward sale obligations at a reasonable cost or at all.

A substantial portion of PSEG Power’s base load generation output has been sold forward under fixed price power sales contracts and PSEG Power also sells forward the output from its intermediate and peaking facilities when it deems it commercially advantageous to do so. Our forward sales of energy and capacity assume sustained, acceptable levels of operating performance. This is especially important at our lower-cost facilities. Operations at any of our plants could degrade to the point where the plant has to shut down or operate at less than full capacity. Some issues that could impact the operation of our facilities are:

•breakdown or failure of equipment, information technology, processes or management effectiveness;

•disruptions in the transmission of electricity;

•labor disputes or work stoppages;

•fuel supply interruptions;

•transportation constraints;

•limitations which may be imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements; and

•operator error, acts of war or terrorist attacks (including cybersecurity breaches) or catastrophic events such as fires, earthquakes, explosions, floods, severe storms or other similar occurrences.

Identifying and correcting any of these issues may require significant time and expense. Depending on the materiality of the issue, we may choose to close a plant rather than incur the expense of restarting it or returning it to full capacity. 

Because the obligations under most of these forward sale agreements are not contingent on a unit being available to generate power, PSEG Power is generally required to deliver power to the buyer even in the event of a plant outage, fuel supply disruption or a reduction in the available capacity of the unit. To the extent that PSEG Power does not have sufficient lower cost capacity to meet its commitments under its forward sale obligations, PSEG Power would be required to pay the difference between the market price at the delivery point and the contract price. The amount of such payments could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, as market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, our forward energy sale and forward fuel purchase contracts could require us to post substantial additional collateral, thus requiring us to obtain additional sources of liquidity during periods when our ability to do so may be limited.

Certain of our generation facilities rely on transmission facilities that we do not own or control and that may be subject to transmission constraints. Transmission facility owners’ inability to maintain adequate transmission capacity could restrict our ability to deliver wholesale electric power to our customers and we may either incur additional costs or forgo revenues. Conversely, improvements to certain transmission systems could also reduce revenues.

We depend on transmission facilities owned and operated by others to deliver the wholesale power we sell from our generation facilities. If transmission is disrupted or if the transmission capacity infrastructure is inadequate, our ability to sell and deliver wholesale power may be adversely impacted. If a region’s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate, our recovery of wholesale costs and profits may be limited. If restrictive transmission price regulation is imposed, the transmission companies may not have sufficient incentive to invest in transmission infrastructure. We also cannot predict whether transmission facilities will invest in specific markets to accommodate competitive access to those markets.

In addition, in certain of the markets in which we operate, energy transmission congestion may occur and we may be deemed responsible for congestion costs if we schedule delivery of power between congestion zones during times when congestion occurs between the zones. If we were liable for such congestion costs, our financial results could be adversely affected.

Conversely, a portion of our generation is located in load pockets. Investment in transmission systems to reduce or eliminate these load pockets could negatively impact the value or profitability of our existing generation facilities in these areas.

REGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS

PSE&G’s revenues, earnings and results of operations are dependent upon state laws and regulations that affect distribution and related activities.

PSE&G is subject to regulation by the BPU. Such regulation affects almost every aspect of its businesses, including its retail rates. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on PSE&G’s ability to operate its business 

30
and could result in fines, penalties or sanctions. The retail rates for electric and gas distribution services are established in a base rate proceeding and remain in effect until a new base rate proceeding is filed and concluded. In addition, our utility has received approval for several clause recovery mechanisms, some of which provide for recovery of costs and earn returns on authorized investments. These clause mechanisms require periodic updates to be reviewed and approved by the BPU and are subject to prudency reviews. Inability to obtain fair or timely recovery of all our costs, including a return of, or on, our investments in rates, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that PSE&G’s exclusive rights to serve its regulated customers were eroded, its future earnings could be negatively impacted. 

In September 2020, the BPU ordered the commencement of a comprehensive affiliate and management audit of PSE&G. The BPU also conducts periodic combined management/competitive service audits of New Jersey utilities related to affiliate standard requirements, competitive services, cross-subsidization, cost allocation and other issues. A finding by the BPU of non-compliance with these requirements could potentially impact our business, results of operations and cash flows. For information regarding PSE&G’s current affiliate and management audit, see Item 8. Note 15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. In addition, PSE&G procures the supply requirements of its default service BGSS gas customers through a full-requirements contract with PSEG Power. Government officials, legislators and advocacy groups are aware of the affiliation between PSE&G and PSEG Power. In periods of rising utility rates, those officials and advocacy groups may question or challenge costs and transactions incurred by PSE&G with PSEG Power, irrespective of any previous regulatory processes or approvals underlying those transactions. The occurrence of such challenges may subject PSEG Power to a level of scrutiny not faced by other unaffiliated competitors in those markets and could adversely affect retail rates received by PSE&G in an effort to offset any perceived benefit to PSEG Power from the affiliation.

PSE&G’s proposed investment programs may not be fully approved by regulators, which could result in lower than desired service levels to customers, and actual capital investment by PSE&G may be lower than planned, which would cause lower than anticipated rate base.

PSE&G is a regulated public utility that operates and invests in an electric T&D system and a gas distribution system as well as certain regulated clean energy investments, including solar and energy efficiency within New Jersey. PSE&G invests in capital projects to maintain and improve its existing T&D system and to address various public policy goals and meet customer expectations. Transmission projects are subject to review in the FERC-approved PJM transmission expansion process while distribution and clean energy projects are subject to approval by the BPU. We cannot be certain that any proposed project will be approved as requested or at all. If the programs that PSE&G may file from time to time are only approved in part, or not at all, or if the approval fails to allow for the timely recovery of all of PSE&G’s costs, including a return of, or on, its investment, PSE&G will have a lower than anticipated rate base, thus causing its future earnings to be lower than anticipated. If these programs are not approved, that could also adversely affect our service levels for customers. Further, the BPU could take positions to exclude or limit utility participation in certain areas, such as renewable generation, energy efficiency, EV infrastructure and energy storage, which would limit our relationship with customers and narrow our future growth prospects.

We are subject to comprehensive federal regulation that affects, or may affect, our businesses.

We are subject to regulation by federal authorities. Such regulation affects almost every aspect of our businesses, including management and operations; the terms and rates of transmission services; investment strategies; the financing of our operations and the payment of dividends. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse impact on our ability to operate our business and could result in fines, penalties or sanctions.

Recovery of wholesale transmission rates—PSE&G’s wholesale transmission rates are regulated by FERC and are recovered through a FERC-approved formula rate. The revenue requirements are reset each year through this formula. Over the past several years, several companies have negotiated settlements that have resulted in reduced ROEs. 

In October 2021, FERC approved a settlement agreement effective August 1, 2021 that we reached with the BPU and the New Jersey Rate Counsel about the level of PSE&G’s base transmission ROE and other formula rate matters. The settlement reduces PSE&G’s base ROE from 11.18% to 9.9% and makes changes to recovery of certain costs. The agreement provides that the settling parties will not seek changes to our transmission formula rate for three years. We have implemented the terms of the agreement and PJM issued refunds to wholesale customers in January 2022. 

In April 2021, FERC issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking to eliminate the incentive for RTO membership for transmitting utilities that have already received the incentive for three or more years. PSE&G began receiving a 50 basis point adder for RTO membership in 2008. Elimination of the adder for RTO membership could reduce PSE&G’s annual Net Income and annual cash inflows by approximately $30 million-$40 million.

Transmission Policy—FERC Order 1000 has generally opened transmission development to competition from independent developers, allowing such developers to compete with incumbent utilities for the construction and operation of transmission facilities in its service territory. While Order 1000 retains limited carve-outs for certain projects that will continue to default to 

31
incumbents for construction responsibility, including immediately needed reliability projects, upgrades to existing transmission facilities, projects cost-allocated to a single transmission zone, and projects being built on existing rights-of-way, increased competition for transmission projects could decrease the value of new investments that would be subject to recovery by PSE&G under its rate base, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

NERC Compliance—NERC, at the direction of FERC, has implemented mandatory NERC Operations and Planning and Critical Infrastructure Protection standards to ensure the reliability of the North American Bulk Electric System, which includes electric transmission and generation systems, and to prevent major system blackouts. NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standards establish cybersecurity and physical security protections for critical systems and facilities. We have been, and will continue to be, periodically audited by NERC for compliance and are subject to penalties for non-compliance with applicable NERC standards. Failure to comply with applicable NERC standards could result in penalties or increased costs to bring such facilities into compliance. Such penalties and costs could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and cash flows. 

MBR Authority and Other Regulatory Approvals—Under FERC regulations, public utilities that sell power at market rates must receive MBR authority before making power sales, and the majority of our businesses operate with such authority. Failure to maintain MBR authorization, or the effects of any severe mitigation measures that would be required if market power was evaluated differently in the future, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Oversight by the CFTC relating to derivative transactions—The CFTC has regulatory oversight of the swap and futures markets and options, including energy trading, and licensed futures professionals such as brokers, clearing members and large traders. Changes to regulations or adoption of additional regulations by the CFTC, including any regulations relating to futures and other derivatives or margin for derivatives and increased investigations by the CFTC, could negatively impact PSEG Power’s ability to hedge its portfolio in an efficient, cost-effective manner by, among other things, potentially decreasing liquidity in the forward commodity and derivatives markets or limiting PSEG Power’s ability to utilize non-cash collateral for derivatives transactions.

We may also be required to obtain various other regulatory approvals to, among other things, buy or sell assets, engage in transactions between our public utility and our other subsidiaries, and, in some cases, enter into financing arrangements, issue securities and allow our subsidiaries to pay dividends. Failure to obtain these approvals on a timely basis could materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.

Our New Jersey nuclear plants may not be awarded ZECs in future periods, or the current or subsequent ZEC program periods could be materially adversely modified through legal proceedings, either of which could result in the retirement of all of these nuclear plants. 

As further described in Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2021 and Future Outlook, in April 2019, PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded ZECs by the BPU through May 2022. In April 2021, these nuclear plants were awarded ZECs for the three-year period starting June 2022. The ZEC payment may be adjusted by the BPU under certain conditions. For instance, the New Jersey Rate Counsel, in written comments filed with the BPU, has advocated for the BPU to offset market benefits resulting from New Jersey’s rejoining the RGGI from the ZEC payment. PSEG intends to vigorously defend against these arguments. Due to its preliminary nature, PSEG cannot predict the outcome of this matter.

In May 2021, the New Jersey Rate Counsel filed an appeal with the New Jersey Appellate Division of the BPU’s April 2021 decision. PSEG cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

In the event that (i) the ZEC program is overturned or is otherwise materially adversely modified through legal process; or (ii) any of the Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek plants is not sufficiently valued for its environmental, fuel diversity or resilience attributes in future periods and does not otherwise experience a material financial change that would remove the need for such attributes to be sufficiently valued, PSEG Power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. Alternatively, even with sufficient valuation of these attributes, if the financial condition of the plants is materially adversely impacted by changes in commodity prices, FERC’s changes to the capacity market construct (absent sufficient capacity revenues provided under a program approved by the BPU in accordance with a FERC-authorized capacity mechanism), or, in the case of the Salem nuclear plants, decisions by the EPA and state environmental regulators regarding the implementation of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act (CWA) and related state regulations, or other factors, PSEG Power will take all necessary steps to cease to operate all of these plants. Ceasing operations of these plants would result in a material adverse impact on PSEG’s results of operations.

We may be adversely affected by changes in energy regulatory policies, including energy and capacity market design rules and developments affecting transmission.

The energy industry continues to be regulated and the rules to which our businesses are subject are always at risk of being changed. Our business has been impacted by established rules that create locational capacity markets in each of PJM, ISO-NE 

32
and NYISO. Under these rules, generators located in constrained areas are paid more for their capacity so there is an incentive to locate in those areas where generation capacity is most needed. PJM’s capacity market design rules and ISO-NE’s FCM rules continue to evolve, most recently in response to efforts to integrate public policy initiatives into the wholesale markets. For a discussion of recent changes in energy regulatory policies that may affect our business and results of operations, see Item 7. MD&A—Executive Overview of 2021 and Future Outlook. 

Further, some of the market-based mechanisms in which we participate are at times the subject of review or discussion by some of the participants in the New Jersey and federal arenas. We can provide no assurance that these mechanisms will continue to exist in their current form, nor otherwise be modified.

To the extent that additions to the transmission system relieve or reduce congestion in eastern PJM where most of our plants are located, PSEG Power’s capacity and energy revenues could be adversely affected. Moreover, through changes encouraged by FERC to transmission planning processes, or through RTO/ISO initiatives to change their planning processes, more transmission may ultimately be built to facilitate renewable generation or support other public policy initiatives. Any such addition to the transmission system could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our ownership and operation of nuclear power plants involve regulatory risks as well as financial, environmental and health and safety risks.

Over half of our total generation output each year is provided by our nuclear fleet. For this reason, we are exposed to risks related to the continued successful operation of our nuclear facilities and issues that may adversely affect the nuclear generation industry. In addition to the risk of retirement discussed below, risks associated with the operation of nuclear facilities include: 

Storage and Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel—Federal law requires the DOE to provide for the permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE has not yet begun accepting spent nuclear fuel. Until a federal site is available, we use on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel, which is reimbursed by the DOE. However, future capital expenditures may be required to increase spent fuel storage capacity at our nuclear facilities. Once a federal site is available, the DOE may impose fees to support a permanent repository. Further, the on-site storage for spent nuclear fuel may significantly increase our nuclear unit decommissioning costs. 

Regulatory and Legal Risk—We may be required to substantially increase capital expenditures or operating or decommissioning costs at our nuclear facilities if there is a change in the Atomic Energy Act or the applicable regulations, trade controls or the environmental rules and regulations applicable to nuclear facilities; a modification, suspension or revocation of licenses issued by the NRC; the imposition of civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, related regulations, trade controls or the terms and conditions of the licenses for nuclear generating facilities; or the shutdown of one of our nuclear facilities. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 

Operational Risk—Operations and equipment reliability at any of our nuclear facilities could degrade to the point where an affected unit needs to be shut down or operated at less than full capacity. If this happened, identifying and correcting the causes may require significant time and expense. Any significant outages could result in reduced earnings as we would have less electric output to sell.

In addition, if a unit cannot be operated through the end of its current estimated useful life, our results of operations could be adversely affected by increased depreciation rates, impairment charges and accelerated future decommissioning costs.

Nuclear Incident or Accident Risk—Accidents and other unforeseen problems have occurred at nuclear stations, both in the U.S. and elsewhere. The consequences of an accident can be severe and may include loss of life, significant property damage and/or a change in the regulatory climate. We have nuclear units at two sites. It is possible that an accident or other incident at a nuclear generating unit could adversely affect our ability to continue to operate unaffected units located at the same site, which would further affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An accident or incident at a nuclear unit not owned by us could lead to increased regulation, which could affect our ability to continue to economically operate our units. Any resulting financial impact from a nuclear accident may exceed our resources, including insurance coverages. Further, as a licensed nuclear operator subject to the Price-Anderson Act and a member of a nuclear industry mutual insurance company, PSEG Power is subject to potential retroactive assessments as a result of an industry nuclear incident or retrospective premiums due to adverse industry loss experience and such assessments may be material.

In the event of non-compliance with applicable legislation, regulation and licenses, the NRC may increase oversight, impose fines, and/or shut down a unit, depending on its assessment of the severity of the non-compliance. If a serious nuclear incident were to occur, our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In each case, the amount and types of insurance available to cover losses that might arise in connection with the operation of our nuclear fleet are limited and may be insufficient to cover any costs we may incur.

Decommissioning—NRC regulations require that licensees of nuclear generating facilities demonstrate reasonable assurance that funds will be available to decommission a nuclear facility at the end of its useful life. PSEG Nuclear has established an NDT Fund to satisfy these obligations. However, forecasting trust fund investment earnings and costs to decommission nuclear generating stations requires significant judgment, and actual results could differ significantly from current estimates. If we 

33
determine that it is necessary to retire one of our nuclear generating stations before the end of its useful life, there is a risk that it will no longer meet the NRC minimum funding requirements due to the earlier commencement of decommissioning activities and a shorter time period over which the NDT investments could appreciate in value. A shortfall could require PSEG to post parental guarantees or make additional cash contributions to ensure that the NDT Fund continues to satisfy the NRC minimum funding requirements. As a result, our financial position or cash flows could be significantly adversely affected.

We are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that may significantly limit or affect our businesses, adversely impact our business plans or expose us to significant environmental fines and liabilities.

We are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding air quality, water quality, site remediation, land use, waste disposal, climate change impact, natural resource damages and other matters. These laws and regulations affect how we conduct our operations and make capital expenditures. With the change in administration following the 2020 presidential election, there have been various recent changes to existing environmental laws and regulations and this trend may continue. Changes in these laws, or violations of laws, could result in significant increases in our compliance costs, capital expenditures to bring facilities into compliance, operating costs for remediation and clean-up actions, civil penalties or damages from actions brought by third parties for alleged health or property damages. Any such increase in our costs could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and could require further economic review to determine whether to continue operations or decommission an affected facility. We may also be unable to successfully recover certain of these cost increases through our existing regulatory rate structures, in the case of PSE&G, or our contracts with our customers, in the case of PSEG Power.

Actions by state and federal government agencies could also result in reduced reliance on natural gas and could potentially result in stranding natural gas assets owned and operated by PSEG Power and PSE&G, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

PSE&G recovers certain remediation and legal costs associated with its manufactured gas plant sites through Remediation Adjustment Charge (RAC) filings with the BPU. Continued future recoveries through the RAC are not guaranteed, Any failure to make future recoveries could materially impact our financial condition. In addition, PSEG Power will retain ownership of certain assets and liabilities excluded from the sale of its fossil generation business, primarily related to obligations under environmental regulations, including possible remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act and the Connecticut Transfer Act. Fulfilling the requirements under these regulations will span multiple years and may require sampling of environmental media to understand the extent of any required remediation. The amounts for any such environmental remediation are not estimable, but may be material.

Environmental laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time, and this trend is likely to continue. For further discussion of environmental laws and regulations impacting our business, results of operations and financial condition, including the impact of federal and state laws and regulations relating to GHG emissions and remediation of environmental contamination, see Item 1. Environmental Matters and Item 8. Note 15. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.

We may not receive necessary licenses and permits in a timely manner or at all, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations.

We must periodically apply for licenses and permits from various regulatory authorities, including environmental regulatory authorities, and abide by their respective orders. Delay in obtaining, or failure to obtain and maintain, any permits or approvals, including environmental permits or approvals, or delay in or failure to satisfy any applicable regulatory requirements, could:

•prevent construction of new facilities,

•limit or prevent continued operation of existing facilities,

•limit or prevent the sale of energy from these facilities, or

•result in significant additional costs,

each of which could materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the process of obtaining licenses and permits from regulatory authorities may be delayed or defeated by concerted community opposition and such delay or defeat could have a material effect on our business.

Changes in tax laws and regulations may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

A prolonged coronavirus pandemic, further economic stimulus, or future federal and state tax legislation could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and cash tax position.
