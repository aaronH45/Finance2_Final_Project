Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully read this entire report, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this annual report entitled “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply, but other categories may also apply.

Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions 

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy, consumer spending and behavior, tourism and to financial markets. While the overall COVID-19 situation appears to be improving, our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if the virus worsens or mutates, if vaccination efforts are unsuccessful and/or if regions or countries take further actions to contain the virus (including additional extended lock-downs and travel restrictions), among others. We continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions about the pandemic for purposes of our business and operating results, including assumptions regarding the duration, severity and global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic; however, the full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operating results will depend largely on future events outside of our control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the success of vaccination efforts, new information concerning the virus or variants of the virus, actions different states, regions or countries may take to contain the virus (including extended lock-downs and travel restrictions) and the economic impacts of the pandemic, including recent inflationary pressures, among others. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government orders and proactive decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, at various points during the course of the pandemic, we temporarily closed almost all of our retail stores globally and furloughed all of our retail store employees in North America and many of our retail personnel elsewhere for an extended period of time. While most of our stores have reopened, we may face new, longer term store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our retail stores in the future. In addition, government restrictions and health and safety measures (including social distancing protocols) may prevent us from opening or limit our ability to fully operate in the ordinary course, which could materially impact our financial results. In addition, we have experienced scattered temporary store closings due to increased levels of retail associate absences and/or labor shortages. We also recently reopened our corporate offices and have implemented a hybrid work policy for many of our corporate employees and determined that some corporate functions may remain fully remote, which may also negatively affect productivity in, or otherwise result in disruptions to, parts of our business.

As a result of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of our wholesale customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, causing a reduction in the amount of merchandise purchased from us and our product licensing partners, an increase in order cancellations and/or the need to extend payment terms. Any or all of these measures could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, these actions could lead to larger outstanding accounts receivable balances, delays in collection of accounts receivable, increased expenses associated with collection efforts, increases in credit losses and reduced cash flows.

Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and continues to impact our supply chain partners, including factories that produce our product, the distribution centers that manage and ship our inventory, logistics providers and other service providers as well as the supply chains of our licensees. The current vessel container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally, as well as disruptions in factory production in certain countries where we source our products has delayed, and is expected to continue to delay, inventory orders and impact product availability in our retail stores and through our e-commerce businesses as well as to our wholesale customers. As a result of these supply chain disruptions, our inventory levels and net revenue have been impacted and could continue to be impacted in future periods. We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, higher freight and other logistics costs, including increased carrier rates for ocean and air shipments, and the supply chain disruptions have caused us to increase our use of air freight with greater frequency than in the past. We are also experiencing negative impacts to the pricing of certain components of our products as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. These higher costs have caused us to increase prices and we may need to increase prices further in the future. There can be no assurance that consumers will accept these price increases or that the price increases will be sufficient to offset our higher costs. 

18
In addition, traffic to our retail stores (and department stores and other third-party retailers that sell our products) may be adversely affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. General macroeconomic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including impacts of a recession or inflationary pressures may negatively impact sales in our physical retail stores, through our e-commerce business and to third-party wholesale accounts. Any significant disruption in consumer traffic, consumer behavior and/or consumer spending at our retail stores, on our e-commerce sites and/or at third-party wholesale accounts following the pandemic would result in a decrease in sales and profits and otherwise materially impact our business and financial performance.

Any or all of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business results and operations. 

The accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is affected by global economic conditions and the related impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Factors that may negatively influence consumer spending include, but are not limited to, high levels of unemployment, pandemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, high consumer debt levels, inflationary pressures, war and global geopolitical instability (including the current war in Ukraine and related economic and other sanctions levied by the United States, European Union and others), reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home prices, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, higher fuel and energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, taxation, political conditions and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as the accessories, footwear and apparel that we produce, tend to decline when disposable income is lower or when there are recessions, inflationary pressures or other economic uncertainty. Reduced consumer confidence and adversely impacted consumer spending patterns due to deteriorating economic conditions or geopolitical instability in any of the regions in which we operate could reduce consumer confidence, negatively impact consumer spending patterns and adversely affect our sales and results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Business

We face risks associated with operating globally and our strategy to continue to expand internationally.

We operate on a global basis, with approximately 47% of our total revenue from operations outside of the United States during Fiscal 2022. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:

•political or civil unrest, including protests and other civil disruption;

•unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and any variants thereof;

•economic instability and unsettled regional and global conflicts (such as the current war in Ukraine), which may negatively affect consumer spending by foreign tourists and local consumers in the various regions where we operate;

•laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments (including sanctions and retaliatory actions by the United States, European Union and others);

•potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies; 

•natural disasters or other extreme weather events, including those attributed to climate change; and

•acts of terrorism, military actions or other conditions over which we have no control.

In addition, our current business strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world and through a number of channels. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There are also some countries where we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations.

We also sell our products at varying retail price points based on geographic location that yield different gross profit margins and we achieve different operating profit margins, depending on geographic region, due to a variety of factors including product mix, store size, occupancy costs, labor costs and retail pricing. Changes in any one or more of these factors could result in lower revenues, increased costs, and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries 

19
and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the gross margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate.

There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is subject to risks inherent in global sourcing activities, including disruptions or delays in manufacturing or shipments.

As a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: 

•disease pandemics, epidemics and health-related concerns, including related to COVID-19 or variants thereof;

•political or labor instability, labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes or otherwise), or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located;

•labor disputes or strikes at the location of the source of our goods and/or at ports of entry;

•disruptions, delays or reductions in shipments, including port delays and congestion, and/or capacity constraints on transportation of goods or at our factories due to COVID-19 or otherwise;

•significant increase in freight, shipping and other logistics costs, including as a result of disruptions at ports of entry;

•political or military conflict (such as the current war in Ukraine);

•heightened terrorism security concerns;

•a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials or other limitations on our ability to use raw materials or goods produced in a country that is a major provider due to political, human rights, labor, environmental or other concerns;

•the migration and development of manufacturing contractors;

•product quality issues;

•imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations;

•increases in the costs of fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation (including vessel and freight);

•imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

•significant fluctuation of the value of the United States dollar against foreign currencies; 

•restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located;

•compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our Supplier Code of Conduct and other applicable compliance policies; 

•compliance with United States laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of “conflict minerals” sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Company’s products and the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable; and

•regulation or prohibition of the transaction of business with specific individuals or entities and their affiliates or goods manufactured in certain regions, such as the listing of a person or entity as a SDN (Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons) by the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the issuance of withhold release orders by CBP.

Any of the foregoing could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop and a decline in consumer traffic could have a negative effect on our comparable store sales and store profitability resulting in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Reduced travel resulting from economic conditions, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including adverse weather conditions, disease pandemics (including COVID-19), epidemics and other health-related concerns, war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks, or unsettled regional 

20
and global conflicts (such as the current war in Ukraine) could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if such events impact our customers’ desire to travel to our retail stores. 

In addition, other factors that could impact the success of our retail stores include: (i) the location of the mall or the location of a particular store within the mall; (ii) the other tenants occupying space at the mall; (iii) vacancies within the mall; (iv) stores and malls having to re-close due to personnel or customer illness or further government restrictions; (v) increased competition in areas where the malls are located; (vi) the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the malls; and (vii) a shift toward online shopping. A decline in consumer traffic could have a negative effect on our comparable store sales and/or average sales per square foot and store profitability. If our retail stores underperform due to declining consumer traffic or otherwise and our expected future cash flows of the related underlying retail store asset do not exceed such asset’s carrying value, we may incur store impairment charges. A decline in future comparable store sales and/or store profitability or failure to meet market expectations or the occurrence of impairment charges relating to our retail store fleet could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Recent changes in our executive management team, the departure of key employees or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.

As we announced on March 7, 2022, Mr. Joshua Schulman, Chief Executive Officer of Michael Kors and expected successor Chief Executive Officer to Mr. John Idol at Capri Holdings, left the Company and Mr. Idol agreed to remain as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. We depend on the services and management experience of executive officers who have substantial experience and expertise in our business as well as key employees involved in our design and marketing operations, including our creative officers for each of our brands, Ms. Donatella Versace, Ms. Sandra Choi and Mr. Michael Kors. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key employees, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future, which may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction, particularly if we fail to ensure a smooth transition and effective transfer of knowledge. Any such disruption or uncertainty could generate a negative public perception and/or have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and the market price of our ordinary shares.

Competition for qualified personnel in the fashion industry is intense and turnover in the industry for retail associates is generally high and has only been exacerbated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our employees. Our ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain employees is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. Additionally, our ability to meet our labor needs while also controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and overtime regulations. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain talented employees with the necessary skills and experience, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, adversely affect morale, hiring and/or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

The long-term growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives.

As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to grow our market share and revenue through the following initiatives:

•trendsetting and innovative product offerings;

•increased brand engagement;

•optimizing customer experience;

•investing in technology; and

•expanding our global presence.

We also intend to support the growth of Versace and Jimmy Choo sales through retail store openings and further developing each brand’s e-commerce and omni-channel presence, as well as expanding into the luxury accessories market. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute on these strategic initiatives.

If we are unable to execute on our strategic initiatives, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

21
If we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business and provide a reliable digital experience for our customers, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.

E-commerce is approximately 17% of our net revenues and has been our fastest growing business over the last several years, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce usage, both domestically and abroad, and promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our wholesale customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure, efficient and user-friendly e-commerce platforms could negatively impact our consumers’ shopping experience, resulting in reduced website traffic, reduced conversion, diminished loyalty to our brands and lost sales. In addition, if due to COVID-19, or otherwise, there is a change in consumer behavior such that customers shift to utilizing e-commerce more than, or even instead, of traditional brick-and-mortar stores, and we or our wholesale partners are unable to attract consumers who previously made in-store purchases to our digital commerce channels, our financial and operating results may be negatively affected.

The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable digital experience for our customers. We strive to give our customers a seamless omni-channel experience both in stores and through digital technologies, such as computers, mobile phones, tablets and other devices. We also use social media to interact with our customers and enhance their shopping experience. Our inability to develop and continuously improve our digital brand engagement could negatively affect our ability to compete with other brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we must keep current with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology and services, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others. Since e-commerce growth is critical to our overall growth strategy, we plan to accelerate Versace’s and Jimmy Choo’s e-commerce and omni-channel development and we are also in the process of re-platforming our brands’ e-commerce sites to expand our global capabilities. Implementing new or improved digital systems, services or technologies, such as new or improved e-commerce platforms, may increase our costs, cause delays in or hinder our ability to continually deliver a reliable or seamless digital experience for our customers, or cause us not to succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. For example, it is possible that consumers may not sign up for our loyalty program at anticipated rates if they do not find the features and benefits compelling or if they are unable to seamlessly navigate the digital experience we offer, which, in turn, may cause us not to realize the benefits that we anticipate from these programs. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.

Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on their timely receipt of our products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our company-operated and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations as well as any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the growth of our e-commerce business. The current vessel container and other transportation shortages, labor shortages and port congestion globally, as well as disruptions in factory production in certain countries where we source our products has delayed, and is expected to continue to delay, inventory orders and impact product availability in our channels, including our e-commerce sites, and have resulted in increased freight and logistics costs. As a result of these supply chain challenges, our inventory levels and net revenue have been impacted and could continue to be impacted in future periods. Continued shortages of inventory, disruptions or delays, significantly higher costs and longer lead times for distributing our products to our consumers could result in customer dissatisfaction, and any of these issues could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.

We may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.

The accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the images of our brands and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. Any misstep in product quality or design, executive leadership, customer services, unfavorable publicity or excessive product discounting could negatively affect the image or our brands with our customers. If we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand names and the images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. We have also recently begun to increase the price of our products. There can be no guarantee that consumers will 

22
accept these price increases. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.

Increased scrutiny from investors and others regarding our corporate social responsibility initiatives, including environmental, social and other matters of significance relating to sustainability, could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation.

Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have increasingly focused on ESG or “sustainability” practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and customer and employee retention may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices and various legal, legislative and regulatory requirements. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.

Our wholesale business could suffer as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings and other ownership changes. 

As a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many of our wholesale customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, causing a reduction in the amount of merchandise purchased from us and our product licensing partners, an increase in order cancellations and/or the need to extend payment terms. Any or all of these measures could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, these actions could lead to larger outstanding accounts receivable balances, delays in collection of accounts receivable, increased expenses associated with collection efforts, increase in excess inventory, increases in credit losses and reduced cash flows.

The retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes over the past several years and a number of wholesale accounts were forced to file bankruptcy or undergo restructurings due to the impact of COVID-19 on their business. We expect that the risk of consolidation, bankruptcy, restructurings or reorganizations by department stores and other retailers will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. This could result in store closings by our wholesale customers, which would decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and/or may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In addition, such consolidation, bankruptcy or other changes with respect to our wholesale customers could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the United States, have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise. We expect that such markdowns may continue to be exacerbated because of the impact of COVID-19. Such promotional activity could negatively impact our business.

Acquisitions may not achieve intended benefits and may not be successfully integrated.

Our acquisitions of Versace and Jimmy Choo or any other entity that we may acquire may not perform as well as initially expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are required to test goodwill, brand and any other intangible assets acquired as a result of acquisitions for impairment. For Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, the carrying value of goodwill and brand intangible value for Jimmy Choo exceeded its respective related fair value, requiring us to record impairment charges for the difference of $163 million and $351 million, respectively.

In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our own business, or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration or we may determine to limit the integration of our brands. In addition to the overarching and continued challenges resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the potential difficulties that we may face that could cause the results of our acquisitions to not be in line with our expectations include, among others:

•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business or to achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets;

23
•delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

•higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

•unanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information and other systems;

•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

•retaining key customers, suppliers and employees;

•operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business;

•diversion of the attention and resources of management and resource constraints;

•retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;

•unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; 

•assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence or other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; and

•the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Additionally, Jimmy Choo outsources its information technology, accounting and other back office activities to a third-party service provider. There are risks of relying on a third-party provider to perform these services, which may include experiencing operational challenges and incurring increased expenses, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within North America and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability and/or gross margins to decline.

Our brands face intense competition from other accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, primarily European and American international luxury brands. In addition, we face competition through third party distribution channels that sell our merchandise, such as e-commerce, department stores and specialty stores. Competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following:

•anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;

•establishing and maintaining favorable brand name recognition;

•determining and maintaining product quality;

•retaining key employees;

•maintaining and growing market share;

•developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers;

•establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers;

•pricing products appropriately;

•providing appropriate service and support to retailers;

•optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities;

•determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and

•protecting intellectual property.

In addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries (including those related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and/or recent inflationary pressures), compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. The general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced revenues, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Competition, along with other factors such as consolidation, changes in consumer spending patterns and a highly promotional retail selling environment, could also result in significant pricing pressure. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our 

24
operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products, and the imposition of additional duties, tariffs or trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

There are risks inherent to importing our products. Virtually all of our imported products are subject to duties which may impact the cost of such products. In addition, countries to which we ship our products may impose safeguard quotas to limit the quantity of products that may be imported. We rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives in order to maximize efficiencies relating to product importation. For example, we have historically received benefits from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the United States Generalized System of Preferences (“GSP”) program. The GSP program expired on December 31, 2020. If the GSP program is not renewed or otherwise made retroactive, we will continue to experience significant additional duties and our gross margin will continue to be negatively impacted. Additionally, we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities, including related to CBP withhold release orders. The imposition of taxes, duties and quotas, the withdrawal from or material modification to trade agreements, and/or if CBP detains shipments of our goods pursuant to a withhold release order could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the United States or other countries, the cost of our products could increase which could adversely affect our business.

We are subject to risks associated with leasing retail space subject to long-term and non-cancelable leases. We may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms. If we close a leased retail space, we remain obligated under the applicable lease. 

We do not own any of our retail store facilities, but instead lease all of our stores under operating leases. Our leases generally have terms of up to 10 years, generally require a fixed annual base rent and some require the payment of additional percentage rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Certain of our European stores also require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations, which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees. Generally, our leases are “net” leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases or withhold payments at our option, and payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. For example, as of April 2, 2022, we were party to operating leases associated with our retail stores that we operate directly throughout the globe, as well as other global corporate facilities, requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to $1.6 billion through Fiscal 2027 and approximately $426 million thereafter through Fiscal 2044. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In certain cases, as we have done in the past, we may determine that it is no longer economical to operate a retail store subject to a lease or we may seek to generally downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate or close some of our real estate locations. In such cases, we may be required to negotiate a lease exit with the applicable landlord or remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. For example, in connection with the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and our Retail Fleet Optimization Plan, we have negotiated with some landlords on certain lease terminations. In some instances, we may be unable to close an underperforming retail store due to continuous operation clauses in our lease agreements. In addition, as each of our leases expire, we may be unable to negotiate renewals, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close retail stores in desirable locations. Our inability to secure desirable retail space or favorable lease terms could impact our ability to grow. Likewise, our obligation to continue making lease payments in respect of leases for closed retail spaces could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Additionally, due to the volatile economic environment, it may be difficult to determine the fair market value of real estate properties when we are deciding whether to enter into leases or renew expiring leases. This may impact our ability to manage the profitability of our store locations, or cause impairments of our lease right-of-use assets if market values decline, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. If one or more of our distribution facilities experience operational difficulties or becomes inoperable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We operate a limited number of distribution facilities. Our ability to meet the needs of our own retail stores and e-commerce sites, as well as our wholesale customers, depends on the proper and uninterrupted operation of these distribution facilities. If any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason 

25
(including due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our customers. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged, inoperable or otherwise inaccessible facility. Any of the foregoing factors could result in decreased sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

To support the growth of our business, we also use third-party logistics centers that are responsible for distribution, warehousing and fulfillment services on our behalf. Significant disruptions at these facilities could have a material adverse impact on our business. Because our direct and third-party fulfillment centers include automated and computer-controlled equipment, they are susceptible to risks including power interruptions, hardware and system failures, software viruses, security breaches and other technological and operational disruptions and of which could cause shipping delays or otherwise adversely affect our business. 

Fluctuations in our tax obligations and changes in tax laws, treaties and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our future effective tax rates and results of operations.

Our subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction. As a result, our overall effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of earnings from the various tax jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any time, there are multiple tax years that are subject to examinations by various taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement amount that differs from our original estimate. Any proposed or future changes in tax laws, treaties and regulations or interpretations where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rates, results of operations and financial condition.

We and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm’s-length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities, which could result in additional tax liabilities. 

On October 5, 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), an international association of thirty four countries, including the United States and United Kingdom., released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties. Future tax reform resulting from this development may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate and/or result in higher cash tax liabilities. In late 2021, the OECD published model legislation and the EU issued a draft directive related to the global minimum tax (“Pillar Two Model Rules”). The directive is to be considered by member countries in calendar 2022 and if approved, could become effective as early as calendar 2023. The enactment of the Pillar Two Model Rules in jurisdictions where we have operations may have a material impact on our global transfer pricing arrangements and a materially adverse impact on our tax provision, cash tax liability and effective tax rate.

Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Our results of operations for our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into United States dollar during financial statement consolidation. If the United States dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could impact our consolidated results of operations. In addition, we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our non-United States subsidiaries, which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity. As a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of the related subsidiary, results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the denomination currency of the note. We continuously monitor our foreign currency exposure and hedge a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we cannot fully anticipate all of our foreign currency exposures and cannot ensure that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use fixed-to-fixed cross currency swap agreements to hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the United States dollar and these foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. 

As a result of operating retail stores and concessions in various countries outside of the United States, we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily the Euro, the British Pound, the Chinese Renminbi, the Japanese Yen, the Korean Won and the Canadian dollar, among others. A substantial weakening of foreign 

26
currencies against the United States dollar could require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margins in various locations outside of the United States. In addition, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices.

Our current and future licensing and joint venture arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.

We have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. We have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas and have a number of joint ventures. In the future, we may enter into additional licensing and/or joint venture arrangements. Although we take steps to carefully select our partners, such arrangements may not be successful. Our partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under these agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner’s ability to:

•obtain capital;

•exercise operational and financial control over its business;

•manage its labor relations;

•maintain relationships with suppliers;

•manage its credit and bankruptcy risks which may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19; and

•maintain customer relationships.

In addition, the geographic areas subject to our licensing agreements could be impacted by geopolitical risks. Any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.

We rely on our partners to preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our partners of our brand. The misuse of our brand by a licensing or joint venture partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.

Our business is subject to volatility of costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products, including inflationary pressure. The costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials which have resulted, and are expected to continue to result, in increased pricing pressures and pressure on our margins. We may not be able to implement price increases that fully mitigate the impact of these higher costs and/or any such price increases could have an adverse impact on consumer demand for our products. In addition, our costs may be impacted by sanction tariffs and customs trade orders which could also impact sourcing and availability of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Manufacturing labor costs are also subject to volatility based on local and global economic conditions. Increases in commodity prices, tariffs, sanctions, customs trade orders and/or manufacturing labor costs could increase our production costs and negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods.

Our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in Asia and Europe. A manufacturing contractor’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to 

27
make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.

We do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. For example, in Fiscal 2022, Michael Kors’ largest manufacturing contractor, who produces its products in Asia and who Michael Kors has worked with for over ten years, accounted for the production of 17% of our finished products, based on dollar volume. Our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and impact the cost and availability of our goods.

Michael Kors uses third-party agents to source finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on its behalf. Any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with Michael Kors at any time. In Fiscal 2022, Michael Kors’ largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is Hong Kong and who Michael Kors has worked with for over ten years, sourced approximately 24% of its purchases of finished goods, based on unit volume. Our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As we outsource functions, we will become more dependent on the third parties performing these functions.

We look for opportunities to cost effectively enhance capability of business services. While we believe we conduct appropriate due diligence before entering into agreements with these third parties, the failure of any of these third parties to provide the expected services, provide them on a timely basis or to provide them at the prices we expect could disrupt or harm our business. Any significant interruption in the operations of these service providers, over which we have no control, could also have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, we may be unable to provide these services or implement substitute arrangements on a timely and cost-effective basis on terms favorable to us.

Our business is susceptible to the risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts which could negatively affect our business and operations.

Our retail stores, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, including those operated by third-parties, are subject to risks relating to climate change and other environmental impacts from our operations. For example, the physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather events, natural disasters and/or significant changes in climate patterns as well as our carbon emissions and our business’ overall impact on the environment could subject us to reputational, market and/or regulatory risks. Climate change and other environmental concerns may cause social and economic disruptions in the places where we operate, including disruptions to our supply chain and to local infrastructure and transportation systems which could limit material availability and quality, impact our ability to ship and deliver product and prevent access to our physical locations. These events could also adversely affect the economy and negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment which may result in increased administrative costs. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on climate change and other sustainability matters. In April 2020, we announced a global strategy to achieve significant, measurable goals across a range of important environmental and social sustainability issues, including, material sourcing, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and converting to renewal energy, responsible water use and waste reduction. We may not be successful in attaining our goals, and even if we meet our commitments, there remains a significant risk that climate change and other environmental events could negatively impact our operations.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors which may cause our profitability and gross margins in the future to be materially lower than our expectations.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent inflationary pressure on the economy and consumer discretionary spending, higher freight costs, intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, wholesale demands for allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support for our partners, changes in consumer behavior, fashion trends, pricing, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather and other environmental conditions. These factors may cause our profitability and gross margins in the future to be materially lower than in recent periods and our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be faced with significant excess inventories (due to the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions or 

28
otherwise), and in the future, if we misjudge the market for our products, we may have excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. We may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess and slow-moving inventory, which also may negatively impact our gross margin and profitability.

Risks Related to Information Technology and Data Security

Privacy breaches and other cyber security risks related to our business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business.

We are dependent on information technology (“IT”) systems and networks for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce sites and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and also rely on third party vendors for the storage, processing and transmission of personal and Company information. Consumers, lawmakers and consumer advocates alike are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and privacy and the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we generally require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures to protect our employees’ and customers’ identity and privacy. We do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee the elimination of electronic or physical computer break-ins or security breaches in the future. Cyber security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, security breaches due to employee error or misconduct, attacks by “hackers,” phishing scams, malicious software programs such as viruses and malware, and other breaches outside of our control, could result in unauthorized access or damage to our IT systems and the IT systems of our third party service providers. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our third-party service providers to secure our and their IT systems, attacks on these systems do occur from time to time. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to IT systems become more varied and sophisticated (as cybercriminals are finding new ways to launch their attacks) and if the occurrence of such security breaches becomes more frequent, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques and implement appropriate preventative measures. While we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks associated with cyber security incidents, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cyber security incident. A significant breach of customer, employee or Company data could damage our reputation, our relationship with customers and our brands, and could result in lost sales, sizable fines, significant breach-notification and other costs and lawsuits, as well as adversely affect our results of operations. We may also incur additional costs in the future related to the implementation of additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security and privacy threats, or to comply with current and new state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which are continuously being enacted and proposed, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU, the California Consumer Privacy Act, the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA) in the United States and the Personal Information Protection Law in China, as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information.

A material delay or disruption in our information technology systems or e-commerce websites or our failure or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We rely extensively on our IT systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, manage customer communications, summarize results and manage our business. The failure of our IT systems to operate properly or effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or difficulty in or failure to implement new systems, could adversely affect our business. We also operate a number of e-commerce websites throughout the world. Our IT systems and e-commerce websites may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, malicious software, such as viruses and malware, attacks by “hackers”, security breaches, usage errors or misconduct by our employees and bad acts by our customers and website visitors which could materially adversely affect our business.

We are undergoing a multi-year ERP implementation. The implementation of the ERP will require a significant investment in human and financial resources. Implementing new systems also carries substantial risk, including failure to operate as designed, failure to properly integrate with other systems, potential loss of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays and disruption of operations. Third-party vendors are also relied upon to design, program, maintain and service our ERP implementation program. Any failures of these vendors to properly deliver their services could similarly have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any disruptions or malfunctions affecting our ERP implementation plan could cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate, inaccessible or lost or 

29
otherwise cause delays or disruptions to our operations, and we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace impacted systems. 

Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory

If we fail to comply with labor laws or collective bargaining agreements, or if our independent manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer.

We are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with respect to employees in certain European countries. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as collective bargaining agreements, may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.

We require our independent manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance, as well as our Supplier Code of Conduct and other compliance policies under our Factory Social Compliance Program. Our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. However, we generally do not control these manufacturing contractors or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate or that violate our Supplier Code of Conduct, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. Further, we could be prohibited from importing goods by governmental authorities. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may be unable to protect our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and others may allege that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights.

Our VERSACE, JIMMY CHOO and MICHAEL KORS trademarks, as well as other material trademarks, copyrights and design and patent rights related to the production, marketing and distribution of our products, are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights in the Americas, EMEA, Asia and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels. Our brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of our products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters to infringe on our brands. We work with customs authorities, law enforcement, legal representatives and brand specialists globally in an effort to prevent the sale of counterfeit products, but we cannot guarantee the extent to which our efforts to prevent counterfeiting of our brands and other intellectual property infringement will be successful. Such counterfeiting and other intellectual property infringement could dilute our brands and otherwise harm our reputation and business.

Our trademark and other intellectual property applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or other intellectual property or to provide the scope of coverage sought, and others may seek to invalidate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property or block sales of our products as an alleged violation of their trademarks and/or intellectual property rights. In addition, others may assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks, copyrights and/or other intellectual property rights of ours or in trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property that are similar to ours or that we license, and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, other intellectual property owners may have prior rights to our trademarks or similar trademarks or intellectual property. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks, copyrights and/or other intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or the European Union.

From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks or other intellectual property similar to some of our brands. Any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights or any allegation that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could be costly and time-consuming and, if determined adversely to us, could result in harm to our competitive position.

We self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. 

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance programs, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks including, employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, employer 

30
liability, general liability, marine transport and inventory, property damage, cyber risk and business interruption. Claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. Any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims in the ordinary course of business which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are a global company and are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims throughout the world in the ordinary course of business. These claims could include commercial, intellectual property, employment, customer and data privacy claims, as well as class action lawsuits. Typically, these claims raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Plaintiffs may seek unspecified damages and/or injunctive or other equitable relief. Our potential liability may be covered in part by our insurance policies, but we may not always have adequate insurance to defend all claims. An unfavorable outcome in any proceeding, lawsuit, dispute or claim may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Risks Related to Our Debt

We have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or engage in additional transactions.

As of April 2, 2022, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.2 billion, net of debt issuance costs. Our total borrowings as of April 2, 2022 primarily relate to senior notes of $450 million, term loans of $497 million and revolving credit facility of $175 million. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have negative consequences to our business and we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs, make necessary capital expenditures or pursue certain business opportunities. Our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing and negatively impact our ability to enter into new financing arrangements in the future.

In addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. We are currently rated investment grade by two of the Company’s three credit rating agencies. If our investment rating is downgraded in the future, it could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.

We may be unable to meet financial covenants in our indebtedness agreements which could result in an event of default and restrictive covenants in such agreements may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.

The terms of our indebtedness contain affirmative and negative covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and may restrict our ability to engage in future business opportunities or pursue our strategies. The Company’s 2018 Credit Facility requires us to maintain a quarterly maximum permitted net leverage ratio of no greater than 4.0 to 1.0. The 2018 Credit Facility and the Indenture governing our senior notes contain certain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to:

•incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

•pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;

•make loans and investments, including acquisitions;

•sell assets;

•incur liens;

•enter into transactions with affiliates; and

•consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets

which collectively may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest.

A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the documents that govern our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the 

31
acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our 2018 Credit Facility would permit the lenders under our 2018 Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:

•limited in how we conduct our business;

•unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and recent inflationary pressures and possible recession; or

•unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares

Our share price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance.

Our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of total revenue, earnings per share and other financial metrics or projections. While we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our share price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our share price.

We periodically return value to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Investors may have an expectation that we will repurchase all shares available under our share repurchase program. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our share repurchase activity differs from investors’ expectations or if our share repurchase program were to terminate.

Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.

As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.

Provisions in our organizational documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.

Our Memorandum and Articles of Association (together, as amended from time to time, our “Memorandum and Articles”) contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares. These provisions include, among others:

•our board of directors’ ability to amend the Memorandum and Articles to create and issue, from time to time, one or more classes of preference shares and, with respect to each such class, to fix the terms thereof by resolution;

•provisions relating to the multiple classes and three-year terms of directors, the manner of election of directors, removal of directors and the appointment of directors upon an increase in the number of directors or vacancy on our board of directors;

•restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call meetings and bring proposals before meetings;

32
•elimination of the ability of shareholders to act by written consent; and

•the requirement of the affirmative vote of 75% of the shares entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our Memorandum and Articles.

These provisions of our Memorandum and Articles could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future, which could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares.

Rights of shareholders under British Virgin Islands law differ from those under United States law, and, accordingly, our shareholders may have fewer protections.

Our corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles, the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended, the “BVI Act”) and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands and by the BVI Act. The common law of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states (such as Delaware) have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. As a result of the foregoing, holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a United States company.

The laws of the British Virgin Islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders, so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs.

Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the BVI Act dealing with shareholder remedies. The principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a British Virgin Islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the Company conducted in accordance with the BVI Act and the memorandum and articles of association of the Company. As such, if those who control the Company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the BVI Act or the provisions of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association, then the courts will likely grant relief. Generally, the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following: (i) an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority; (ii) acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the Company; (iii) acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders, such as the right to vote; and (iv) acts where the Company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders, which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the United States.

It may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the United States.

Under our Memorandum and Articles, we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them, subject to limited exceptions. Furthermore, to the extent allowed by law, the rights and obligations among or between us, any of our current or former directors, officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the British Virgin Islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands courts, unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such. Although there is doubt as to whether United States' courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the United States under United States securities laws, these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the British Virgin Islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the British Virgin Islands or jurisdictions that would apply British Virgin Islands law.

British Virgin Islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions, thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interests.

British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States. The circumstances in which any such action may be brought, and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action, may result in the rights of shareholders of a British Virgin Islands' company being more 

33
limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States. Accordingly, shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred. The British Virgin Islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the United States based on certain liability provisions of United States securities law or to impose liabilities, in original actions brought in the British Virgin Islands, based on certain liability provisions of the United States securities laws that are penal in nature. There is no statutory recognition in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will generally recognize and enforce the non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. This means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully, they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered.
