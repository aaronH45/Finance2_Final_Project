MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS

In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales growth, Systemwide sales growth, after-tax return on invested capital from continuing operations, free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.

•Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as material regulatory and other income tax impacts, and bases incentive compensation plans on these results because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.

•Comparable sales are compared to the same period in the prior year and represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters (including restaurants temporarily closed due to COVID-19). Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation and the sales of any market considered hyper-inflationary (generally identified as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%), which management believes more accurately reflects the underlying business trends. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, the latter of which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix.

•Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. This includes sales from digital channels, which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk at both Company-operated and franchised restaurants. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Changes in Systemwide sales are primarily driven by comparable sales and net restaurant unit expansion.

•The Company’s after-tax return on invested capital ("ROIC") from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiveness over time. Other companies may calculate ROIC differently, limiting the usefulness of the measure for comparisons with other companies. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculation of ROIC.

•Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value. Refer to the reconciliations in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K for further information on the Company's calculations of free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate.

2021 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE 

In 2021, global comparable sales increased 17.0%, primarily due to strong sales performance across all segments from continued execution of the Accelerating the Arches strategy, as well as recovery from the impact of COVID-19 in the prior year. 

•Comparable sales in the U.S. increased 13.8%, benefiting primarily from strong average check growth, successful menu and marketing promotions and growth in digital channels, which benefited from the launch of the Company's loyalty program.

•Comparable sales in the International Operated segment increased 21.6%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all markets, primarily driven by the U.K. and France.

•Comparable sales in the International Developmental Licensed segment increased 16.6%, reflecting positive comparable sales across all geographic regions.

In addition to the comparable sales results, the Company had the following financial results in 2021:

•Consolidated revenues increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $23.2 billion.

•Systemwide sales increased 21% (18% in constant currencies) to $112.5 billion.

•Consolidated operating income increased 41% (38% in constant currencies) to $10.4 billion. Refer to the Operating Income section on page 17 of this Form 10-K for additional details.

•Operating margin, defined as operating income as a percent of total revenues, increased from 38.1% in 2020 to 44.6% in 2021. Excluding net strategic gains detailed in the Operating Income section on page 17 of this Form 10-K, operating margin increased from 36.7% in 2020 to 43.4% in 2021. 

•Diluted earnings per share of $10.04 increased 59% (56% in constant currencies). Refer to the Net Income and Diluted Earnings Per Share section on page 12 of this Form 10-K for additional details.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 8

•Cash provided by operations was $9.1 billion, a 46% increase from the prior year.

•Capital expenditures of $2.0 billion were allocated mainly to reinvestment in existing restaurants and, to a lesser extent, to new restaurant openings.

•Free cash flow was $7.1 billion, a 54% increase from the prior year.

•Across the System, nearly 1,500 new restaurants (including those in developmental licensee and affiliate markets) were opened. 

•The Company increased its quarterly cash dividend per share by 7% to $1.38 for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an annual dividend of $5.52 per share. The Company returned a total of $4.8 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends in 2021.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION 

In late 2020, the Company announced the Accelerating the Arches growth strategy (the “Strategy”). The Strategy, which encompasses all aspects of McDonald’s business as the leading global omni-channel restaurant brand, reflects a refreshed purpose, updated values and growth pillars that build on the Company’s competitive advantages. The Company's values, which underpin its success and are at the very heart of its Strategy, are discussed further in the Purpose, Mission and Values section on page 4 of this Form 10-K. In 2021, the Company made strides as it maximized the MCD growth pillars to create seamless, memorable customer experiences. Additionally, the creation of the Customer Experience Team brought together teams responsible for global marketing, digital, restaurant development and operations, enabling McDonald’s to create an unparalleled customer experience at each physical and digital customer touchpoint.

GROWTH PILLARS

The growth pillars, rooted in the Company’s identity, MCD, build on historic strengths and articulate areas of further opportunity. Under the Strategy, the Company will:

•Maximize our Marketing by investing in new, culturally relevant approaches, such as our Famous Orders platform, to effectively communicate the story of our brand, food and purpose. This also includes enhancing digital capabilities that provide a more personal connection with customers. The Company is committed to a marketing strategy that highlights value at every tier of the menu, as affordability remains a cornerstone of the McDonald’s brand.

•Commit to the Core by tapping into customer demand for the familiar and focusing on serving delicious burgers, chicken and coffee. The Company is prioritizing chicken and beef offerings, as we expect they represent the largest growth opportunities. The Company recognizes there is significant opportunity to expand its chicken offerings by leveraging line extensions of customer favorites, such as the new Crispy Chicken Sandwich that launched in the U.S. in 2021 and the McSpicy Chicken Sandwich, which is now in many markets around the world. The Company is also implementing a series of operational and formulation changes designed to improve upon the great taste of our burgers. We also see a significant opportunity with coffee, and markets are leveraging the McCafé brand, experience, value and quality to drive long-term growth.

•Double Down on the 3D's: Digital, Delivery and Drive Thru by leveraging competitive strengths and building a powerful digital experience growth engine to enhance the customer experience. To unlock further growth, the Company is continuing to accelerate technology innovation so that, however customers choose to interact with McDonald’s, they can enjoy a fast, easy experience that meets their needs. Notably, 2021 Systemwide sales from digital channels (which are comprised of the mobile app, delivery and kiosk) exceeded $18 billion, or over 25% of Systemwide sales in our top six markets. 

◦Digital: The Company’s digital experience growth engine — “MyMcDonald’s” — is transforming its offerings across drive thru, takeaway, delivery, curbside pick-up and dine-in with digital enhancements. Through the digital tools, customers can access tailored offers, participate in a loyalty program, order through the mobile app and receive McDonald's food through the channel of their choice. The Company has successful loyalty programs in over 40 markets around the world, including “MyMcDonald’s Rewards” in the U.S., Germany and Canada, each of which launched in 2021. The Company expects to complete the roll-out of loyalty programs across its top six markets in the first half of 2022. Just six months after its launch, MyMcDonald’s Rewards in the U.S. has enrolled 30 million members, with over 21 million active loyalty members earning rewards. 

◦Delivery: The Company has expanded the number of restaurants offering delivery to over 33,000, representing over 80% of McDonald's restaurants, and delivery sales have grown significantly over the past few years. The Company is continuing to build on this progress and enhance the delivery experience for customers by adding the ability to order on the McDonald’s app and optimizing operations with a focus on speed and accuracy. In 2021, the Company entered into long-term strategic partnerships with two of its largest global delivery providers, UberEats and DoorDash, which are expected to benefit both customers and franchisees. 

◦Drive Thru: The Company has drive thru locations in over 25,000 restaurants globally, including nearly 95% of the 13,000+ locations in the U.S. This channel remains of heightened importance, and we expect that it will become even more critical to meet customers’ demand for flexibility and choice. The Company is building on its drive thru advantage, as the vast majority of new restaurant openings in the U.S. and International Operated Markets will include a drive thru. 

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 9

Foundational to the Accelerating the Arches Strategy is keeping the customer at the center of everything we do, along with a relentless focus on running great restaurants. The Company believes this Strategy builds on our inherent strengths by harnessing our competitive advantages while leveraging our size, scale and agility to adapt and adjust to operating conditions and consumer demands. These efforts, coupled with investment in innovation, are designed to enhance the customer experience and deliver long-term profitable growth, which is aligned with the Company’s capital allocation philosophy of investing in new restaurants and opportunities to grow the business, reinvesting in existing restaurants, and returning all free cash flow to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases.

OUTLOOK

Based on current conditions, the following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company's results for 2022.

•The Company expects net restaurant unit expansion will contribute about 1.5% to 2022 Systemwide sales growth, in constant currencies.

•The Company expects full year 2022 selling, general & administrative expenses of between 2.2% and 2.3% of Systemwide sales.

•The Company expects operating margin percent to be in the low-to-mid 40% range.

•Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2022 to be relatively flat to 2021.

•Under current tax legislation, the Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the 20% to 22% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.

•The Company expects 2022 capital expenditures to be approximately $2.2 to $2.4 billion, about half of which will be directed towards new restaurant unit expansion across the U.S. and International Operated Markets. About 40% will be dedicated to the U.S. business, most of which will go towards reinvestment, including the completion of restaurant modernization efforts. Globally, the Company expects to open over 1,800 restaurants. The Company will open over 500 restaurants in the U.S. and International Operated Markets segments, and developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards over 1,300 restaurant openings in their respective markets. The Company expects over 1,400 net restaurant additions in 2022.

•The Company expects to achieve a free cash flow conversion rate greater than 90%.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes beginning on page 38 of this Form 10-K. This section generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and the year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and the year-to-year comparisons between the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021.

Impact of COVID-19 Restrictions on the Business

As a result of COVID-19, throughout 2020 and 2021, markets experienced varying levels of government restrictions on restaurant operating hours, limited dine-in capacity, dining room closures and, primarily in 2020, some instances of full restaurant closures. The Company has applied appropriate precautionary measures, including following the guidance of expert health authorities, and will continue to adapt and enhance its approach in order to protect the safety and well-being of its customers and people. As most revenues and the Company's share of net results in equity investments are based on sales results, consumer sentiment and government restrictions as a result of COVID-19 may continue to have an impact on results.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS

While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.

Impact of foreign currency translation on reported results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2021, results primarily reflected the strengthening of the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. 

NET INCOME AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

In 2021, net income increased 59% (56% in constant currencies) to $7.5 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 59% (56% in constant currencies) to $10.04. Foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $0.20 on diluted earnings per share. 

Results in 2021 reflected stronger operating performance across all segments due to higher sales-driven restaurant margins as the Company continues to execute on its Accelerating the Arches Strategy. Results also benefited from fewer restaurant closures and reduced COVID-related government restrictions compared with the prior year.

Outlined below is additional information for the full year 2021, 2020 and 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2021 results included:

REVENUES 

The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. The Company’s Other revenues are comprised of fees paid by franchisees to recover a portion of costs incurred by the Company for various technology platforms, revenues from brand licensing arrangements to market and sell consumer packaged goods using the McDonald’s brand and third party revenues for the Dynamic Yield business.

Franchised restaurants represented 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2021. The Company's heavily franchised business model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue, which is largely a function of franchisee sales and resulting cash flow streams. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2021, total Company-operated sales and franchised revenues increased 21% (19% in constant currencies). Results reflected strong sales performance across all segments and were driven by the U.K., France and Russia in the International Operated Markets segment.

Due to the impact of COVID-19 in 2020, comparable sales growth from 2020 to 2021 may not be fully indicative of the Company's performance. Therefore in 2021, management also analyzed comparable sales growth on a two-year basis as a metric to compare results for 2021 against more normalized sales performance in 2019. The following chart presents comparable sales growth on a two-year basis by segment:

RESTAURANT MARGINS 

Franchised restaurant margins are measured as revenues from franchised restaurants less franchised restaurant occupancy costs. Franchised revenues include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales, and initial fees. Franchised restaurant occupancy costs include lease expense and depreciation, as the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location.

Company-operated restaurant margins are measured as sales from Company-operated restaurants less costs for food & paper, payroll & employee benefits and occupancy & other operating expenses necessary to run an individual restaurant. Company-operated margins exclude costs that are not allocated to individual restaurants, primarily payroll & employee benefit costs of non-restaurant support staff, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Restaurant margins

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2021, total restaurant margins increased 29% (26% in constant currencies), which reflected strong sales performance across all segments.

Franchised margins represented over 85% of restaurant margin dollars.

Franchised margins in the U.S. reflected higher depreciation costs related to investments in restaurant modernization while benefiting from the comparison to prior year support for marketing provided to franchisees to accelerate recovery and drive growth.

Total restaurant margins included $1,533 million of depreciation and amortization expenses in 2021.

(1)Includes home office support costs in areas such as facilities, finance, human resources, investments in strategic technology initiatives, legal, marketing, restaurant operations, supply chain and training.

(2)Includes all cash incentives and share-based compensation expense.

In 2021, consolidated selling, general & administrative expenses increased 6% (5% in constant currencies), reflecting an increase in incentive-based compensation expense driven by stronger than planned operating results and higher costs for investments in restaurant technology. These results also benefited from the comparison to the Company's five-year, $100 million commitment to RMHC, increased investments in brand communications and incremental marketing contributions in 2020.

Management believes that analyzing selling, general & administrative expenses as a percent of Systemwide sales is meaningful because these costs are incurred to support the overall McDonald's business.

•Gains on sales of restaurant businesses

In 2021, gains on sales of restaurant businesses increased due to a higher number of restaurant sales, primarily in the U.S., the U.K. and Germany. 

•Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 

In 2021, equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates increased due to the recovery from the impact of COVID-19, offset by lower equity in earnings as a result of the reduced ownership in McDonald's Japan.

•Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net

Asset dispositions and other (income) expense, net reflected lower bad debt expense and lower restaurant closing costs compared to the prior year, as well as higher gains on strategic property sales and the comparison to prior year payments to distribution centers for obsolete inventory to support franchisee liquidity.

•Impairment and other charges (gains), net

In 2021, impairment and other charges (gains), net reflected $339 million of pre-tax strategic gains related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock. These results were partly offset by $54 million of strategic charges primarily related to the sale of McD Tech Labs.

The results in 2020 reflected $274 million of pre-tax strategic gains related to the sale of McDonald's Japan stock. Results for the year 2020 also reflected the write-off of impaired software of $26 million, partly offset by $13 million of income associated with the Company's sale of its business in the India Delhi market.

The results in 2019 reflected $99 million of impairment associated with the purchase of the Company's joint venture partner's interest in the India Delhi market, partly offset by $20 million of gains on the sales of property at the former Corporate headquarters.

CASH FLOWS 

The Company has a long history of generating significant cash from operations and has substantial credit capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

Cash provided by operations totaled $9.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.9 billion or 46%. Free cash flow was $7.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.5 billion or 54%. The Company’s free cash flow conversion rate was 94% in 2021 and 98% in 2020. Cash provided by operations increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to improved operating results and changes in working capital, partly offset by higher income tax payments.

Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $620 million compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and purchases of restaurant businesses, partly offset by higher sales of restaurant businesses and property. 

 Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $3.3 billion compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to $1.1 billion in net debt repayments in 2021 compared with $2.2 billion in net debt issuances in 2020.

The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $4.7 billion and $3.4 billion at year end 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Approximately 93% of the restaurants at year-end 2021 were franchised, including 95% in the U.S., 84% in International Operated Markets and 98% in the International Developmental Licensed Markets.

Capital expenditures increased $399 million or 24% in 2021 due to higher reinvestment in existing restaurants and an increase in new restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Capital expenditures decreased $753 million or 31% in 2020 primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants as a result of COVID-19.

 McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 20 

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY TYPE (In millions) 

* Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures.

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, as well as leveraging the Company's global sourcing network and best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately $4.4 million in 2021. 

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company owned approximately 55% of the land and 80% of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS  

In 2021, the Company returned approximately $4.8 billion to shareholders, primarily through dividends paid.

Shares repurchased and dividends 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2020, that authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date.

Net property and equipment decreased $0.2 billion in 2021, primarily due to depreciation and the impact of foreign exchange rates. Net property and equipment and the Lease right-of-use asset, net represented approximately 46% and approximately 25%, respectively, of total assets at year-end. Approximately 84% of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2021. 

The Company’s after-tax ROIC from continuing operations is a metric that management believes measures capital-allocation effectiveness over time and was 21.5%, 14.9% and 19.2% as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to improved operating results and recovery from the impact of COVID-19 as well as lower average debt balances compared to the prior year. Refer to the reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.

FINANCING AND MARKET RISK

The Company generally borrows on a long-term basis and is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations. Debt obligations at December 31, 2021 totaled $35.6 billion, compared with $37.4 billion at December 31, 2020. The net decrease in 2021 was due to net repayments of $1.1 billion and the impact of changes in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt of $731 million.

(1)All percentages are as of December 31, except for the weighted-average annual interest rate, which is for the year. See reconciliation in Exhibit 99.1.

(2)Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs. These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K.

(3)Includes the effect of interest rate swaps used to hedge debt.

Standard & Poor's and Moody's currently rate the Company’s commercial paper A-2 and P-2, respectively, and its long-term debt BBB+ and Baa1, respectively. To access the debt capital markets, the Company relies on credit-rating agencies to assign short-term and long-term credit ratings. 

Certain of the Company’s debt obligations contain cross-acceleration provisions and restrictions on Company and subsidiary mortgages and the long-term debt of certain subsidiaries. There are no provisions in the Company’s debt obligations that would accelerate repayment of debt as a result of a change in credit ratings or a material adverse change in the Company’s business. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized $15 billion of borrowing capacity with no specified expiration date, of which $8.3 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021. These borrowings may include (i) public or private offering of debt securities; (ii) direct borrowing from banks or other financial institutions; and (iii) other forms of indebtedness. In April 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors provided additional authorization to issue commercial paper and draw on lines of credit agreements up to $8 billion in addition to the $15 billion authorized as referenced above. In addition to debt securities available through a medium-term notes program registered with the SEC and a Global Medium-Term Notes program, the Company has $4.5 billion available under committed line of credit agreements (see the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K). As of December 31, 2021, the Company's subsidiaries also had $263 million of borrowings outstanding, primarily under uncommitted foreign currency line of credit agreements.

The Company uses major capital markets, bank financings and derivatives to meet its financing requirements. The Company manages its debt portfolio in response to changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates by periodically retiring, redeeming and repurchasing debt, terminating swaps and using derivatives. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading purposes. All swaps are over-the-counter instruments.

In managing the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, the Company uses interest rate swaps and finances in the currencies in which assets are denominated. The Company uses foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with certain royalties, intercompany financings and long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates. This reduces the impact of fluctuating foreign currencies on cash flows and shareholders’ equity. Total foreign currency-denominated debt was $12.8 billion and $13.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, where practical, the Company’s restaurants purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges. See the Summary of significant accounting policies footnote related to financial instruments and hedging activities on page 47 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the accounting impact and use of derivatives.

The Company does not have significant exposure to any individual counterparty and has master agreements that contain netting arrangements. Certain of these agreements also require each party to post collateral if credit ratings fall below, or aggregate exposures exceed, certain contractual limits. At December 31, 2021, neither the Company nor its counterparties were required to post collateral on any derivative position, other than on hedges of certain of the Company’s supplemental benefit plan liabilities where the counterparties were required to post collateral on their liability positions.

 McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 22 

The Company’s net asset exposure is diversified among a broad basket of currencies. The Company’s largest net asset exposures (defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities) at year end were as follows:

Foreign currency net asset exposures

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company prepared sensitivity analyses of its financial instruments to determine the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and the fair value of its financial instruments. The interest rate analysis assumed a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates on all financial instruments, but did not consider the effects of the reduced level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment. The foreign currency rate analysis assumed that each foreign currency rate would change by 10% in the same direction relative to the U.S. Dollar on all financial instruments; however, the analysis did not include the potential impact on revenues, local currency prices or the effect of fluctuating currencies on the Company’s anticipated foreign currency royalties and other payments received from the markets. Based on the results of these analyses of the Company’s financial instruments, neither a one percentage point adverse change in interest rates from 2021 levels nor a 10% adverse change in foreign currency rates from 2021 levels would materially affect the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or the fair value of its financial instruments.

LIQUIDITY AND USES OF CASH

The Company generates significant cash from operations and expects available cash and cash equivalents, future operating cash flows and its ability to issue debt to be sufficient to finance its foreseeable operating needs and other cash requirements.

Consistent with prior years, the Company expects existing domestic cash and equivalents, domestic cash flows from operations, the ability to issue domestic debt and repatriation of a portion of foreign earnings to continue to be sufficient to fund its domestic operating, investing and financing activities. The Company also continues to expect existing foreign cash and equivalents and foreign cash flows from operations to be sufficient to fund its foreign operating, investing and financing activities. In the future, should more capital be required to fund activities in the U.S. than is generated by domestic operations and is available through the issuance of domestic debt, the Company could elect to repatriate a greater portion of future periods' earnings from foreign jurisdictions.

The Company has significant operations outside the U.S. where it earns approximately 65% of its operating income. A significant portion of these historical earnings have been reinvested in foreign jurisdictions where the Company has made, and will continue to make, substantial investments to support the ongoing development and growth of its international operations.

Sources of Liquidity 

The Company has long-term revenue and cash flow streams that relate to its franchise arrangements. Minimum rent payments under franchise arrangements are based on the Company’s underlying investment in owned sites and parallel the Company’s underlying lease obligations and escalations on properties that are leased. The Company believes that control over the real estate enables it to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry. Refer to the Franchise Arrangements footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information on future gross minimum payments due to the Company under existing conventional franchise arrangements.

Additionally, the Company is authorized to utilize up to $15 billion of borrowing capacity in various forms by the Board of Directors, of which $8.3 billion remains outstanding as of December 31, 2021, as well as the ability to issue commercial paper and draw on lines of credit agreements up to $8 billion. Refer to the Financing and Market Risk section on page 22 of this Form 10-K.

Material Cash Requirements and Uses of Cash

Material cash requirements primarily consist of lease obligations (related to both Company-operated and franchised restaurants) and debt obligations. Refer to the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 and the Debt Financing footnote on page 57 of this Form 10-K for more information.

The Company also records liabilities related to supplemental benefit plans maintained in the U.S. as well as liabilities for gross unrecognized tax benefits on certain tax positions. Details related to these obligations are provided in the Employee Benefit Plan footnote on page 56 and the Income Taxes footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K.

The Company contracts with vendors and suppliers in the normal course of business. These contracts may include items related to construction projects, inventory, energy, marketing, technology and other services. Generally, these items are shorter term in nature and have no minimum payment requirements. These expenses, along with other standard operating expenses incurred, are funded from operating cash flows and reflected in other areas of this Form 10-K (e.g., franchised margins, Company-operated margins and selling, general & administrative expenses that are reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Income and capital expenditures that are reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows).

Additionally, the Company has guaranteed certain loans totaling approximately $110 million at December 31, 2021. These guarantees are contingent commitments generally issued by the Company to support borrowing arrangements of the System. At December 31, 2021, there was no carrying value for obligations under these guarantees in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

OTHER MATTERS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The Company reviews its financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to confirm that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. The Company believes that of its significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:

•Property and equipment 

Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives based on management’s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue (not to exceed lease term plus options for leased property). The useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets, taking into account anticipated technological or other changes. Refer to the Property and Equipment section in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote on page 44 of this Form 10-K and the Property and Equipment footnote on page 51 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

•Leasing Arrangements 

The Lease right-of-use asset and Lease liability include an assumption on renewal options that have not yet been exercised by the Company. The Company also uses an incremental borrowing rate in calculating the Lease liability that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment. Refer to the Leasing section in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote on page 44 of this Form 10-K and the Leasing Arrangements footnote on page 52 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

•Long-lived assets impairment review 

Long-lived assets (including goodwill) are reviewed for impairment annually. If qualitative indicators of impairment are present, such as changes in global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, and consumer and demographic trends, the Company will use these and other factors in estimating future cash flows when testing for the recoverability of its long-lived assets. Estimates of future cash flows are highly subjective judgements based on the Company’s experience and knowledge of its operations. A key assumption impacting estimated future cash flows is the estimated change in comparable sales. If the Company’s estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, it may be required to record impairment charges. Refer to the Long-lived Assets and Goodwill sections in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote on page 45 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

•Litigation accruals 

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to proceedings, lawsuits and other claims primarily related to competitors, customers, employees, franchisees, government agencies, intellectual property, shareholders and suppliers. The Company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses. Refer to the Contingencies footnote on page 53 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

•Income taxes 

The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company operates within, and is subject to audit in, multiple taxing jurisdictions. The Company records accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. 

Refer to the Income Taxes section in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies footnote on page 46 of this Form 10-K and the Income Taxes footnote on page 54 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES — INFLATION 

Broader inflationary pressures in the economy are expected to continue to impact the restaurant industry through supply chain and labor cost challenges—fueled in part by pent-up demand, supply chain interruptions and rising energy prices. The Company has demonstrated an ability to manage these inflationary cost increases effectively through its rapid inventory turnover, ability to adjust menu prices, cost controls and substantial property holdings, many of which are at fixed costs and partly financed by debt made less expensive by inflation.

FIVE-YEAR SUMMARY

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Represents treasury stock purchases as reflected in Shareholders' equity. Treasury stock purchases decreased from 2019 to 2020 as the Company suspended its share repurchase program in March 2020. The Company resumed its share repurchase program in the third quarter of 2021.

(2)Total assets increased from 2018 to 2019 primarily due to the Company's Lease right-of-use asset recorded as a result of the adoption of Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842").

(3)While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes they are important in understanding the Company's financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. Franchised restaurants represent 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2021.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 25

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH 

At least annually, McDonald's considers which companies comprise a readily identifiable investment peer group. The Company is included in published restaurant indices; however, unlike most other companies included in these indices, which have no or limited international operations, McDonald's does business in more than 100 countries and a substantial portion of its revenues and income is generated outside the U.S. In addition, because of its size, McDonald's inclusion in those indices tends to skew the results. Therefore, the Company believes that such a comparison is not meaningful.

The Company's market capitalization, trading volume and importance in an industry that is vital to the U.S. economy have resulted in McDonald's inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("DJIA") since 1985. Like McDonald's, many DJIA companies generate meaningful revenues and income outside the U.S. and some manage global brands. Thus, the Company believes that the use of the DJIA companies as the group for comparison purposes is appropriate.

The following performance graph shows McDonald's cumulative total shareholder returns (i.e., price appreciation and reinvestment of dividends) relative to the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index ("S&P 500 Index") and to the DJIA companies for the five-year period ended December 31, 2021. The graph assumes that the value of an investment in McDonald's common stock, the S&P 500 Index and the DJIA companies (including McDonald's) was $100 at December 31, 2016. For the DJIA companies, returns are weighted for market capitalization as of the beginning of each period indicated. These returns may vary from those of the DJIA Index, which is not weighted by market capitalization and may be composed of different companies during the period under consideration.

MARKET INFORMATION AND DIVIDEND POLICY

The Company’s common stock trades under the symbol "MCD" and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange in the U.S. 

The number of shareholders of record and beneficial owners of the Company’s common stock as of January 31, 2022 was estimated to be 3,400,000.

Given the Company’s returns on its capital investments and significant cash provided by operations, management believes it is prudent to reinvest in the business to drive profitable growth and use excess cash flow to return cash to shareholders over time through dividends and share repurchases. The Company has paid dividends on common stock for 46 consecutive years through 2021 and has increased the dividend amount at least once every year. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.

RISK FACTORS 

Our business results are subject to a variety of risks, including those that are described below and elsewhere in our filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business. If any of these risks materialize or intensify, our expectations (or the underlying assumptions) may change and our performance may be adversely affected.

GLOBAL PANDEMIC

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect our financial results, condition and outlook.

Health epidemics or pandemics can adversely affect consumer spending and confidence levels and supply availability and costs, as well as the local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our financial results, condition and outlook. Importantly, the global pandemic resulting from COVID-19 has disrupted global health, economic and market conditions, consumer behavior and McDonald’s global restaurant operations since early 2020, and has resulted in increased pressure on labor availability and supply chain management. Local and national governmental mandates or recommendations and public perceptions of the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and we expect will continue to cause, consumer behavior to change, worsening or volatile economic conditions in certain markets, and increased regulatory complexity and compliance costs, each of which could continue to adversely affect our business. In addition, our global operations have been disrupted to varying degrees in different markets and may continue to be disrupted to varying degrees given the unpredictability of the virus, its resurgences and variants and government responses thereto as well as potentially permanent changes to the industry in which we operate. While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the resurgence of infections or the emergence of new variants in one or more markets, the availability, acceptance or effectiveness of vaccines or vaccination rates across the globe, the pandemic has negatively impacted our business and is expected to continue to impact our financial results, condition and outlook in a way that may be material.

The COVID-19 pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, including, but not limited to, those related to labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand and competition.

STRATEGY AND BRAND

If we do not successfully evolve and execute against our business strategies, including the Accelerating the Arches strategy, we may not be able to drive business growth.

To drive Systemwide sales, operating income and free cash flow growth, our business strategies must be effective in maintaining and strengthening customer appeal and capturing additional market share. Whether these strategies are successful depends mainly on our System’s ability to:

•capitalize on our global scale, iconic brand and local market presence to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages, such as our marketing, core menu items and digital, delivery and drive thru;

•continue to innovate and differentiate the McDonald’s experience, including by preparing and serving our food in a way that balances value and convenience to our customers with profitability;

•accelerate technology investments for a fast and easy customer experience;

•continue to run great restaurants by driving efficiencies and expanding capacities while continuing to prioritize health and safety;

•identify and develop restaurant sites consistent with our plans for net growth of Systemwide restaurants;

•accelerate our existing strategies, including through growth opportunities and potential acquisitions, investments and partnerships; and

•evolve and adjust our business strategies in response to, among other things, changing consumer behavior, operational restrictions and impacts to our results of operations and liquidity, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

If we are delayed or unsuccessful in executing our strategies, or if our strategies do not yield the desired results, our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer.

Failure to preserve the value and relevance of our brand could have an adverse impact on our financial results.

To be successful in the future, we believe we must preserve, enhance and leverage the value of our brand, including our corporate purpose, mission and values. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions, which are affected by a variety of factors, including the nutritional content and preparation of our food, the ingredients we use, the manner in which we source commodities and general business practices across the System, including the people practices at McDonald’s restaurants. Consumer acceptance of our offerings is subject to change for a variety of reasons, and some changes can occur rapidly. For example, nutritional, health, environmental and other scientific studies and conclusions, which constantly evolve and may have contradictory implications, drive popular opinion, litigation and regulation (including initiatives intended to drive consumer behavior) in ways that affect the “informal eating out” (“IEO”) segment or perceptions of our brand, generally or relative to available alternatives. Our business could also be impacted by business incidents or practices, whether actual or perceived, particularly if they receive considerable publicity or result in litigation, as well as by our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social responsibility, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters. Consumer perceptions may also be affected by adverse commentary from third parties, including through social media or conventional media outlets, regarding the quick-service category of the IEO segment or our brand, culture, operations, suppliers or franchisees. If we are unsuccessful in addressing adverse commentary or perceptions, whether or not accurate, our brand and financial results may suffer.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 28

If we do not anticipate and address evolving consumer preferences and effectively execute our pricing, promotional and marketing plans, our business could suffer.

Our continued success depends on our System’s ability to build upon our historic strengths and competitive advantages. In order to do so, we need to anticipate and respond effectively to continuously shifting consumer demographics and trends in food sourcing, food preparation, food offerings, and consumer behavior and preferences, including with respect to environmental and social responsibility matters, in the IEO segment. If we are not able to predict, or quickly and effectively respond to, these changes, or if our competitors predict or respond more effectively, our financial results could be adversely impacted.

Our ability to build upon our strengths and advantages also depends on the impact of pricing, promotional and marketing plans across the System, and the ability to adjust these plans to respond quickly and effectively to evolving customer behavior and preferences, as well as shifting economic and competitive conditions. Existing or future pricing strategies and marketing plans, as well as the value proposition they represent, are expected to continue to be important components of our business strategy. However, they may not be successful, or may not be as successful as the efforts of our competitors, which could negatively impact sales, guest counts and market share.

Additionally, we operate in a complex and costly advertising environment. Our marketing and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively, efficiently and in ways that are meaningful to them. If our advertising and marketing programs are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales, guest counts and market share could decrease.

Our investments to enhance the customer experience, including through technology, may not generate the expected results.

Our long-term business objectives depend on the successful Systemwide execution of our strategies. We continue to build upon our investments in technology and modernization, digital engagement and delivery in order to transform the customer experience. As part of these investments, we are continuing to place emphasis on improving our service model and strengthening relationships with customers, in part through digital channels and loyalty initiatives, mobile ordering and payment systems, and enhancing our drive thru technologies, which may not generate expected results. We also continue to offer and refine our delivery initiatives, including through growing awareness and trial. Utilizing a third-party delivery service may not have the same level of profitability as a non-delivery transaction, and may introduce additional food quality, food safety and customer satisfaction risks. If these customer experience initiatives are not well executed, or if we do not fully realize the intended benefits of these significant investments, our business results may suffer.

We face intense competition in our markets, which could hurt our business.

We compete primarily in the IEO segment, which is highly competitive. We also face sustained, intense competition from traditional, fast casual and other competitors, which may include many non-traditional market participants such as convenience stores, grocery stores, coffee shops and online retailers. We expect our environment to continue to be highly competitive, and our results in any particular reporting period may be impacted by a contracting IEO segment or by new or continuing actions, product offerings or consolidation of our competitors and third-party partners, which may have a short- or long-term impact on our results.

We compete on the basis of product choice, quality, affordability, service and location. In particular, we believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products, successfully develop and introduce new products, price our products appropriately, deliver a relevant customer experience, manage the complexity of our restaurant operations, manage our investments in technology and modernization, and respond effectively to our competitors’ actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving some metrics while adversely affecting other metrics, which could have the overall effect of harming our business.

We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of the McDonald’s brand and our business.

The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products.

We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to do so in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. In particular, we may be involved in intellectual property claims, including often aggressive or opportunistic attempts to enforce patents used in information technology systems, which might affect our operations and results. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business.

We cannot ensure that franchisees and other third parties who hold licenses to our intellectual property will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 29

OPERATIONS

The global scope of our business subjects us to risks that could negatively affect our business.

We encounter differing cultural, regulatory, geopolitical and economic environments within and among the more than 100 countries where McDonald’s restaurants operate, and our ability to achieve our business objectives depends on the System’s success in these environments. Meeting customer expectations is complicated by the risks inherent in our global operating environment, and our global success is partially dependent on our System’s ability to leverage operating successes across markets and brand perceptions. Planned initiatives may not have appeal across multiple markets with McDonald’s customers and could drive unanticipated changes in customer perceptions and guest counts.

Disruptions in operations or price volatility in a market can also result from governmental actions, such as price, foreign exchange or changes in trade-related tariffs or controls, sanctions and counter sanctions, government-mandated closure of our, our franchisees’ or our suppliers’ operations, and asset seizures. Trade policies, tariffs and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries could adversely affect our business and operations. These and other government actions may impact our results and could cause reputational or other harm. Our international success depends in part on the effectiveness of our strategies and brand-building initiatives to reduce our exposure to such governmental actions.

Additionally, there are challenges and uncertainties associated with operating in developing markets, which may entail a relatively higher risk of political instability, economic volatility, crime, corruption and social and ethnic unrest. In many cases, such challenges may be exacerbated by the lack of an independent and experienced judiciary and uncertainty in how local law is applied and enforced, including in areas most relevant to commercial transactions and foreign investment. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

We may also face challenges and uncertainties in developed markets. For example, the U.K.’s exit from the European Union has caused increased regulatory complexities and uncertainty in European economic conditions and may also cause uncertainty in worldwide economic conditions. The decision created volatility in certain foreign currency exchange rates that may or may not continue, and may result in increased supply chain costs for items that are imported from other countries. Any of these effects, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Supply chain interruptions may increase costs or reduce revenues.

We depend on the effectiveness of our supply chain management to assure reliable and sufficient supply of quality products on favorable terms. Although many of the products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of suppliers in countries around the world, certain products have limited suppliers, which may increase our reliance on those suppliers. Supply chain interruptions and related price increases can adversely affect us as well as our suppliers and franchisees, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results. Such interruptions and price increases could be caused by shortages, unexpected increases in demand, transportation issues, labor issues, weather-related events, natural disasters or other factors beyond the control of us or our suppliers or franchisees. If we experience interruptions in our System’s supply chain, or if contingency planning is not effective, our costs could increase and/or the availability of products critical to our System’s operations could be limited.

Our franchise business model presents a number of risks.

Our success as a heavily franchised business relies to a large degree on the financial success and cooperation of our franchisees, including our developmental licensees and affiliates. Our restaurant margins arise from two sources: fees from franchised restaurants (e.g., rent and royalties based on a percentage of sales) and, to a lesser degree, sales from Company-operated restaurants. Our franchisees and developmental licensees manage their businesses independently and therefore are responsible for the day-to-day operation of their restaurants. The revenues we realize from franchised restaurants are largely dependent on the ability of our franchisees to grow their sales. Business risks affecting our operations also affect our franchisees. In particular, our franchisees have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatility associated with the pandemic. If franchisee sales trends worsen or volatility persists, our financial results could be negatively affected, which may be material.

Our success also relies on the willingness and ability of our independent franchisees and affiliates to implement major initiatives, which may include financial investment, and to remain aligned with us on operating, value/promotional and capital-intensive reinvestment plans. The ability of franchisees to contribute to the achievement of our plans is dependent in large part on the availability to them of funding at reasonable interest rates and may be negatively impacted by the financial markets in general, by their or our creditworthiness or by banks’ lending practices. If our franchisees are unwilling or unable to invest in major initiatives or are unable to obtain financing at commercially reasonable rates, or at all, our future growth and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our operating performance could also be negatively affected if our franchisees experience food safety or other operational problems or project an image inconsistent with our brand and values, particularly if our contractual and other rights and remedies are limited, costly to exercise or subjected to litigation and potential delays. If franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our required standards, our brand’s image and reputation could be harmed, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.

Our ownership mix also affects our results and financial condition. The decision to own restaurants or to operate under franchise or license agreements is driven by many factors whose interrelationship is complex. The benefits of our more heavily franchised structure depend on various factors including whether we have effectively selected franchisees, licensees and/or affiliates that meet our rigorous standards, whether we are able to successfully integrate them into our structure and whether their performance and the resulting ownership mix supports our brand and financial objectives.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 30

Challenges with respect to labor, including availability and cost, could impact our business and results of operations.

Our success depends in part on our System’s ability to proactively recruit, motivate and retain qualified individuals to work in McDonald’s restaurants and to maintain appropriately-staffed restaurants in an intensely competitive labor market. If we or our franchisees are unable to adequately staff McDonald’s restaurants, it could negatively impact our operations, including speed of service to customers, and customer satisfaction levels. The System’s ability to meet its labor needs is generally subject to external factors, including the availability of sufficient workforce, unemployment levels and prevailing wages in the markets in which we operate.

Further, increased costs and competition associated with recruiting, motivating and retaining qualified employees, as well as costs associated with promoting awareness of the opportunities of working at McDonald’s restaurants, could have a negative impact on our Company-operated margins and our franchisees’ profitability.

We are also impacted by the costs and other effects of compliance with U.S. and international regulations affecting our workforce, which includes our staff and employees working in our Company-operated restaurants. These regulations are increasingly focused on employment issues, including wage and hour, healthcare, immigration, retirement and other employee benefits and workplace practices. Claims of non-compliance with these regulations could result in liability and expense to us. Our potential exposure to reputational and other harm regarding our workplace practices or conditions or those of our independent franchisees or suppliers, including those giving rise to claims of harassment or discrimination (or perceptions thereof) or workplace safety, could have a negative impact on consumer perceptions of us and our business. Additionally, economic action, such as boycotts, protests, work stoppages or campaigns by labor organizations, could adversely affect us (including our ability to recruit, motivate and retain talent) or our franchisees and suppliers, whose performance may have a significant impact on our results.

Effective succession planning is important to our continued success.

Effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Failure to effectively identify, develop and retain key personnel, recruit high-quality candidates and ensure smooth management and personnel transitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results.

Food safety concerns may have an adverse effect on our business.

Our ability to increase sales and profits depends on our System’s ability to meet expectations for safe food and on our ability to manage the potential impact on McDonald’s of food-borne illnesses and food or product safety issues that may arise in the future, including in the supply chain, restaurants or delivery. Food safety is a top priority, and we dedicate substantial resources to ensure that our customers enjoy safe food products, including as our menu and service model evolve. However, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness, occur within the food industry and our System from time to time and could occur in the future. Instances of food tampering, food contamination or food-borne illness, whether actual or perceived, could adversely affect our brand and reputation, as well as our financial results.

If we do not effectively manage our real estate portfolio, our operating results may be negatively impacted.

We have significant real estate operations, primarily in connection with our restaurant business. We generally own or secure a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites. We seek to identify and develop restaurant locations that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential. As we generally secure long-term real estate interests for our restaurants, we have limited flexibility to quickly alter our real estate portfolio. The competitive business landscape continues to evolve in light of changing business trends, consumer preferences, trade area demographics, consumer use of digital, delivery and drive thru, local competitive positions and other economic factors. If our restaurants are not located in desirable locations, or if we do not evolve in response to these factors, it could adversely affect Systemwide sales and profitability.

Our real estate values and the costs associated with our real estate operations are also impacted by a variety of other factors, including governmental regulations, insurance, zoning, tax and eminent domain laws, interest rate levels and the cost of financing. A significant change in real estate values, or an increase in costs as a result of any of these factors, could adversely affect our operating results.

Information technology system failures or interruptions, or breaches of network security, may impact our operations or cause reputational harm.

We are increasingly reliant upon technology systems, such as point-of-sale, technologies that support our digital and delivery solutions, and technologies that facilitate communication and collaboration with affiliated entities, customers, employees, franchisees, suppliers, service providers or other independent third parties to conduct our business, whether developed and maintained by us or provided by third parties. Any failure or interruption of these systems could significantly impact our or our franchisees’ operations, or our customers’ experience and perceptions.

Security incidents or breaches have from time to time occurred and may in the future occur involving our systems, the systems of the parties we communicate or collaborate with (including franchisees) or the systems of third-party providers. These may include such things as unauthorized access, phishing attacks, account takeovers, denial of service, computer viruses, introduction of malware or ransomware and other disruptive problems caused by hackers. Certain of these technology systems contain personal, financial and other information of our customers, employees, franchisees, business customers and other third parties, as well as financial, proprietary and other confidential information related to our business. Despite response procedures and measures in place in the event of an incident, a security breach could result in disruptions, shutdowns, or the theft or unauthorized disclosure of such information. The actual or alleged occurrence of any of these incidents could result in mitigation costs, reputational damage, adverse publicity, loss of consumer confidence, reduced sales and profits, complications in executing our growth initiatives and regulatory and legal risk, including criminal penalties or civil liabilities.

We also provide certain technology systems to businesses that are unaffiliated with the McDonald’s System and a failure, interruption or breach of these systems may cause harm to those unaffiliated parties, which may result in liability to us or reputational harm.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 31

Despite the implementation of security measures, any of these technology systems could become vulnerable to damage, disability or failures due to theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events. Certain technology systems may also become vulnerable, unreliable or inefficient in cases where technology vendors limit or terminate product support and maintenance. Our increasing reliance on third-party systems also subjects us to risks faced by those third-party businesses, including operational, security and credit risks. If technology systems were to fail or otherwise be unavailable, or if business continuity or disaster recovery plans were not effective, and we were unable to recover in a timely manner, we could experience an interruption in our or our franchisees’ operations.

LEGAL AND REGULATORY

Increasing regulatory and legal complexity may adversely affect our business and financial results.

Our regulatory and legal environment worldwide exposes us to complex compliance, litigation and similar risks that could affect our operations and results in material ways. Many of our markets are subject to increasing, conflicting and highly prescriptive regulations involving, among other matters, restaurant operations, product packaging, marketing, the nutritional and allergen content and safety of our food and other products, labeling and other disclosure practices. Compliance efforts with those regulations may be affected by ordinary variations in food preparation among our own restaurants and the need to rely on the accuracy and completeness of information from third-party suppliers. We also are subject to increasing public focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, on environmental, social responsibility and corporate governance (“ESG”) initiatives. Our success depends in part on our ability to manage the impact of regulations and other initiatives that can affect our business plans and operations, which have increased and may continue to increase our costs of doing business and exposure to litigation, governmental investigations or other proceedings.

We are also subject to legal proceedings that may adversely affect our business, including class actions, administrative proceedings, government investigations and proceedings, shareholder proceedings, employment and personal injury claims, landlord/tenant disputes, supplier-related disputes, and claims by current or former franchisees. Regardless of whether claims against us are valid or whether we are found to be liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management’s attention away from operations.

Litigation and regulatory action concerning our relationship with franchisees and the legal distinction between our franchisees and us for employment law or other purposes, if determined adversely, could increase costs, negatively impact our business operations and the business prospects of our franchisees and subject us to incremental liability for their actions. Similarly, although our commercial relationships with our suppliers remain independent, there may be attempts to challenge that independence, which, if determined adversely, could also increase costs, negatively impact the business prospects of our suppliers, and subject us to incremental liability for their actions.

Our results could also be affected by the following:

•the relative level of our defense costs, which vary from period to period depending on the number, nature and procedural status of pending proceedings;

•the cost and other effects of settlements, judgments or consent decrees, which may require us to make disclosures or take other actions that may affect perceptions of our brand and products; and

•adverse results of pending or future litigation, including litigation challenging the composition and preparation of our products, or the appropriateness or accuracy of our marketing or other communication practices.

A judgment significantly in excess of any applicable insurance coverage or third-party indemnity could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from claims may hurt our business. If we are unable to effectively manage the risks associated with our complex regulatory and legal environment, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect the taxes we pay and our profitability.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives around the world. In particular, we are affected by the impact of changes to tax laws or policy or related authoritative interpretations. We are also impacted by settlements of pending or any future adjustments proposed by taxing and governmental authorities inside and outside of the U.S. in connection with our tax audits, all of which will depend on their timing, nature and scope. Any significant increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or unfavorable resolution of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.

Changes in accounting standards or the recognition of impairment or other charges may adversely affect our future operations and results.

New accounting standards or changes in financial reporting requirements, accounting principles or practices, including with respect to our critical accounting estimates, could adversely affect our future results. We may also be affected by the nature and timing of decisions about underperforming markets or assets, including decisions that result in impairment or other charges that reduce our earnings.

In assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, we consider changes in economic conditions and make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. These estimates are highly subjective and can be significantly impacted by many factors such as global and local business and economic conditions, operating costs, inflation, competition, consumer and demographic trends and our restructuring activities. If our estimates or underlying assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges. If we experience any such changes, they could have a significant adverse effect on our reported results for the affected periods.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 32

If we fail to comply with privacy and data collection laws, we could be subject to legal proceedings and penalties, which could negatively affect our financial results or brand perceptions.

We are subject to legal and compliance risks and associated liability related to privacy and data collection, protection and management as it relates to information associated with our technology-related services and platforms made available to business partners, customers, employees, franchisees or other third parties. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) requires entities processing the personal data of individuals in the European Union to meet certain requirements regarding the handling of that data. We are also subject to U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). These regulations have been subject to frequent change, and there may be markets or jurisdictions that propose or enact new or emerging data privacy requirements in the future. Failure to comply with GDPR, CCPA or other privacy and data collection laws could result in legal proceedings and substantial penalties and materially adversely impact our financial results or brand perceptions.

MACROECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS

Unfavorable general economic conditions could adversely affect our business and financial results.

Our results of operations are substantially affected by economic conditions, including inflationary pressures, which can vary significantly by market and can impact consumer disposable income levels and spending habits. Economic conditions can also be impacted by a variety of factors including hostilities, epidemics, pandemics and actions taken by governments to manage national and international economic matters, whether through austerity, stimulus measures or trade measures, and initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers. Sustained adverse economic conditions or periodic adverse changes in economic conditions in our markets could pressure our operating performance and our business continuity disruption planning, and our business and financial results may suffer.

Our results of operations are also affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and unfavorable currency fluctuations could adversely affect reported earnings.

Changes in commodity and other operating costs could adversely affect our results of operations.

The profitability of our Company-operated restaurants depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in commodity costs, including food, paper, supplies, fuel, utilities, distribution and other operating costs, including labor. Any volatility in certain commodity prices or fluctuation in labor costs could adversely affect our operating results by impacting restaurant profitability. The commodity markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as beef, chicken and pork, are particularly volatile due to factors such as seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, international commodity markets, food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control and, in many instances, unpredictable. Our System can only partially address future price risk through hedging and other activities, and therefore increases in commodity costs could have an adverse impact on our profitability.

A decrease in our credit ratings or an increase in our funding costs could adversely affect our profitability.

Our credit ratings may be negatively affected by our results of operations or changes in our debt levels. As a result, our interest expense, the availability of acceptable counterparties, our ability to obtain funding on favorable terms, our collateral requirements and our operating or financial flexibility could all be negatively affected, especially if lenders impose new operating or financial covenants.

Our operations may also be impacted by regulations affecting capital flows, financial markets or financial institutions, which can limit our ability to manage and deploy our liquidity or increase our funding costs. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

Trading volatility and the price of our common stock may be adversely affected by many factors.

Many factors affect the volatility and price of our common stock in addition to our operating results and prospects. The most important of these factors, some of which are outside our control, are the following:

•the unpredictable nature of global economic and market conditions;

•governmental action or inaction in light of key indicators of economic activity or events that can significantly influence financial markets, particularly in the U.S., which is the principal trading market for our common stock, and media reports and commentary about economic, trade or other matters, even when the matter in question does not directly relate to our business;

•trading activity in our common stock, in derivative instruments with respect to our common stock or in our debt securities, which can be affected by market commentary (including commentary that may be unreliable or incomplete); unauthorized disclosures about our performance, plans or expectations about our business; our actual performance and creditworthiness; investor confidence, driven in part by expectations about our performance; actions by shareholders and others seeking to influence our business strategies; portfolio transactions in our common stock by significant shareholders; or trading activity that results from the ordinary course rebalancing of stock indices in which McDonald’s may be included, such as the S&P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average;

•the impact of our stock repurchase program or dividend rate; and

•the impact on our results of corporate actions and market and third-party perceptions and assessments of such actions, such as those we may take from time to time as we implement our strategies, including through acquisitions, in light of changing business, legal and tax considerations and evolve our corporate structure.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 33

Our business is subject to an increasing focus on ESG matters.

In recent years, there has been an increasing focus by stakeholders – including employees, franchisees, customers, suppliers, governmental and non-governmental organizations and investors – on ESG matters. A failure, whether real or perceived, to address ESG matters or to achieve progress on our ESG initiatives could adversely affect our business, including by heightening other risks disclosed in these Risk Factors, such as those related to consumer behavior, consumer perceptions of our brand, labor availability and costs, supply chain interruptions, commodity costs, and legal and regulatory complexity. Conversely, our taking a position, whether real or perceived, on ESG, public policy, geopolitical and similar matters could adversely impact our business.

The standards we set for ourselves regarding ESG matters, and our ability to meet such standards, may also impact our business. For example, we are working to manage risks and costs to our System related to climate change, greenhouse gases, and diminishing energy and water resources, and we have announced initiatives relating to, among other things, environmental sustainability, responsible sourcing and increasing diverse representation across our System. We may face increased scrutiny related to reporting on and achieving these initiatives, as well as continued public focus on similar matters, such as packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. We may also face increased pressure from stakeholders to provide expanded disclosure and establish additional commitments, targets or goals, and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to additional market, operational, execution and reputational costs and risks. Moreover, addressing ESG matters requires Systemwide coordination and alignment, and the standards by which certain ESG matters are measured are evolving and subject to assumptions that could change over time.

Events such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, among others, can adversely affect our results and prospects.

Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, hostilities and social unrest, climate change or terrorist activities (or expectations about them) can adversely affect consumer behavior and confidence levels, supply availability and costs and local operations in impacted markets, all of which can affect our results and prospects. Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of such weather-related events and natural disasters. Our receipt of proceeds under any insurance we maintain with respect to some of these risks may be delayed or the proceeds may be insufficient to cover our losses fully.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

The Company has pending a number of lawsuits that have been filed in various jurisdictions. These lawsuits cover a broad variety of allegations spanning the Company’s business. The following is a brief description of the more significant types of such claims and lawsuits. In addition, the Company is subject to various national and local laws and regulations that impact various aspects of its business, as discussed under “Government Regulations” below. While the Company does not believe that any such claims, lawsuits, laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations, unfavorable rulings could occur. Were an unfavorable ruling to occur, it could result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s net income for the period in which it occurs and/or future periods.

▪Franchising

A substantial number of McDonald’s restaurants are franchised to independent owner/operators and developmental licensees under contractual arrangements with the Company. In the course of the franchise relationship, occasional disputes arise between the Company and its current or former franchisees relating to a broad range of subjects, including, but not limited to, quality, service and cleanliness issues, menu pricing, contentions regarding franchise grants or terminations, alleged discrimination, delinquent payments of rents and fees and claims for additional franchises or franchise renewals. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals who claim they should have been granted a franchise or who challenge the legal distinction between the Company and its franchisees for employment law purposes.

▪Suppliers 

The Company and its affiliates and subsidiaries generally do not supply food, paper or related items to any McDonald’s restaurants. The Company relies upon numerous independent suppliers, including service providers, that are required to meet and maintain the Company’s high standards and specifications. On occasion, disputes arise between the Company and its current or former suppliers relating to, for example, compliance with product specifications and the Company’s business relationship with suppliers. Occasional disputes also arise between the Company and individuals or entities who claim that they should be (or should have been) granted the opportunity to supply products or services to the Company’s restaurants.

▪Employees

Hundreds of thousands of people are employed by the Company and in restaurants owned and operated by subsidiaries of the Company. In addition, thousands of people from time to time seek employment in such restaurants. In the ordinary course of business, disputes occasionally arise regarding hiring, termination, promotion and pay practices, including, but not limited to, wage and hour disputes, alleged discrimination and compliance with labor and employment laws.

▪Customers

McDonald’s restaurants – whether owned by subsidiaries of the Company, independent owner/operators or developmental licensees – regularly serve a broad segment of the public. In so doing, disputes occasionally arise as to products, service, incidents, pricing, advertising, nutritional and other disclosures, as well as other matters common to an extensive restaurant business such as that of the Company.

McDonald's Corporation 2021 Annual Report 34

▪Intellectual Property

The Company has registered trademarks, service marks, patents and copyrights, some of which are of material importance to its business. From time to time, the Company may become involved in litigation to protect its intellectual property and defend against the alleged use of third-party intellectual property. 

▪Government Regulations

National and local governments have adopted laws and regulations involving various aspects of the restaurant business, including, but not limited to, advertising, franchising, health, safety, environment, competition, zoning, employment and taxation. The Company is occasionally involved in litigation or other proceedings regarding these matters. While the Company strives to comply with all applicable existing statutory and administrative rules, it cannot predict the effect on its operations of these matters or the issuance of any future additional requirements.

PROPERTIES 

The Company owns and leases real estate primarily in connection with its restaurant business. The Company identifies and develops sites that offer convenience to customers and long-term sales and profit potential to the System. To assess potential, the Company analyzes traffic and walking patterns, census data and other relevant data. The Company’s experience and access to advanced technology aid in evaluating this information. The Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for conventional franchised and Company-operated restaurant sites, which facilitates long-term occupancy rights and helps control related costs. Restaurant profitability for both the Company and franchisees is important; therefore, ongoing efforts are made to control average development costs through construction and design efficiencies, standardization and by leveraging the Company’s global sourcing network.

In addition, the Company primarily leases real estate in connection with its corporate headquarters, field and other offices.

Additional information about the Company’s properties is included in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section beginning on page 8 of this Form 10-K and in the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data section beginning on page 37 of this Form 10-K.
