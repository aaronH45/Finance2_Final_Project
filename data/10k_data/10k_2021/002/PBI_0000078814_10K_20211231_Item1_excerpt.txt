Presort Services

We are a workshare partner of the USPS and national outsource provider of mail sortation services that allow clients to qualify large volumes of First-Class Mail, Marketing Mail and Marketing Mail Flats and Bound Printed Matter for postal workshare discounts. Our network of operating centers throughout the United States and fully-customized proprietary technology provides clients with end-to-end solutions from pick up to delivery into the postal system network, expedited mail delivery and optimal postage savings. 

Sending Technology Solutions

We provide clients with physical and digital mailing and shipping technology solutions and other applications to help simplify and save on the sending, tracking and receiving of letters, parcels and flats. We also offer supplies and maintenance services for these offerings. Our cloud enabled infrastructure provides software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings delivered online and via connected or mobile devices. Our latest offerings are designed on an open platform architecture that have the capabilities to leverage partnerships with carriers, developers and other innovative companies to deliver value to our clients. We offer financing alternatives that enable clients to finance equipment and product purchases.

Through our wholly owned subsidiary, The Pitney Bowes Bank (the Bank), we offer our clients in the United States a revolving credit solution that enables clients to make meter rental payments and purchase postage, services and supplies and an interest-bearing deposit solution to clients who prefer to prepay postage. Additionally, we offer financing alternatives that enable clients to finance or lease other manufacturers’ equipment and provide working capital. 

We provide revolving credit solutions to clients in Canada and the U.K. that enable them to make meter rental payments and purchase postage, services and supplies. 

We establish credit approval limits and procedures based on the credit quality of the client and the type of product or service provided. We closely monitor the portfolio by analyzing industry sectors and delinquency trends by product line, industry and client to ensure reserve levels and credit policies reflect current trends. Management continuously monitors credit lines and collection resources and revises credit policies as necessary.

Seasonality

A larger percentage of our revenue is earned in the fourth quarter relative to the other quarters, driven primarily by higher shipping volumes during the holiday season.

Sales and Services

We market our products, solutions and services through a direct and inside sales force, global and regional partner channels, direct mailings and digital channels. We provide call-center, online and on-site support services for our products and solutions. Support services are primarily provided under maintenance contracts.

Competition

Our businesses face competition from large, multinational companies and smaller, more narrowly focused regional and local firms. We compete on the basis of technology and innovation, breadth of product offerings, our ability to design and tailor targeted solutions to meet client needs, performance, service and support, price, quality and brand.

We must continue to invest in our current technologies, products and solutions, and in the development of new technologies, products and solutions in order to maintain and improve our competitive position. We frequently encounter new competitors as the markets in which we participate evolve and newer businesses enter our existing markets. 

A summary of the competitive environment for each of our segments is as follows:

Global Ecommerce

The domestic parcel services and cross-border solutions market includes competitors of various sizes, including companies with greater financial resources than us. Some of these competitors specialize in point solutions or freight forwarding services, are full-service ecommerce business process outsourcers and online marketplaces with international logistic support, or major global delivery services companies. We also face competition from companies that can offer both domestic and cross-border solutions in a single package which creates pricing leverage. The principal competitive factors include speed of delivery, price, ease of integration and use, innovative services, reliability, functionality and scalability. We compete based on the accuracy, reliability and scalability of our platform and logistics services, our ability to provide clients and their customers a one-stop full-service ecommerce experience and the ability to provide a more customized shipping solution than some of the larger competitors in the industry. 

Our digital delivery services business competes with technology providers who help make shipping easier and more cost-effective. These technology providers range from large, established companies to smaller companies offering negotiated carrier rates. The principal competitive factors include technology stability and reliability, innovation, access to preferred shipping rates and ease of integration with existing systems.

Presort Services

We face competition from regional and local presort providers, cooperatives of multiple local presort providers, consolidators and service bureaus that offer presort solutions as part of a larger bundle of outsourcing services. We also face competition from large mailers that have sufficient volumes and the capability to sort their own mailings in-house and could use excess capacity to offer presort services to others. The principal competitive factors include price, innovative service, delivery speed, tracking and reporting, industry expertise and economies of scale. Our competitive advantages include our extensive network of presort facilities capable of processing significant volumes and our innovative proprietary technology that provides clients with reliable, secure and precise services and maximum postage discounts. 

Sending Technology Solutions

We face competition from other mail equipment and solutions providers and those that offer online shipping and mailing products and services solutions. Additionally, the growth of alternative communication methods as compared to physical mail continue to grow, which creates competition to mail and also to our offerings that enable clients to use the mail efficiently. We differentiate ourselves from our competitors through our breadth of physical and digital offerings, including cloud enabled SaaS and open platform architecture offerings; pricing; available financing and payment offerings; product reliability; support services; and our extensive knowledge of the shipping and mailing industry. 

Our financing operations face competition, in varying degrees, from large, diversified financial institutions, including leasing companies, commercial finance companies and commercial banks, as well as small, specialized firms. We believe our competitive advantage that differentiates us from our competitors is the breadth of our financing and payment solutions and our ability to seamlessly integrate these solutions into our clients' shipping and mailing operations.

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

We invest in research and development activities to develop new products and solutions, enhance the effectiveness and functionality of existing products and solutions and deliver high value technology and differentiated services in high value segments of the market. 

Third-Party Suppliers

Our Sending Technology Solutions (SendTech Solutions) segment depends on third-party suppliers and outsource providers for a variety of services and product components and the hosting of our SaaS offerings. Our Global Ecommerce and Presort Services segments rely on third party suppliers to help equip our facilities, provide warehouse support and assist with our logistical operations. All of our businesses and corporate functions depend on third-party providers for a variety of data analytics, sales, reporting and other functions. In certain instances, we rely on single-sourced or limited-sourced suppliers and outsourcing vendors around the world because doing so is advantageous due to quality, price or lack of alternative sources. We have risk mitigation programs to monitor conditions affecting our suppliers' ability to fulfill expected commitments. We believe that our available sources for services, components, supplies, logistics and manufacturing are adequate.

Regulatory Matters 

We are subject to the regulations of postal authorities worldwide related to product specifications of our postage meters. Our Presort Services segment is also subject to regulations of the USPS. The Bank is chartered as an Industrial Bank under the laws of the State of Utah. The Bank and certain company affiliates that provide services to the Bank are subject to the regulations of the Utah Department of Financial Institutions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We are also subject to transportation regulations for various parts of our business, customs and trade regulations worldwide related to our cross-border shipping services and regulations concerning data privacy and security for our businesses that use, process and store certain personal, confidential or proprietary data. 

Climate Change

Although climate change has had no material impact on our operations to date, the risk of increasingly severe climate events or the risk that those events happen more frequently could affect one or more of our facilities and our ability to conduct daily operations in the future. Increasing regulatory restrictions in response to climate change could also materially affect our costs, especially with respect to transportation.

Human Capital 

We have approximately 11,500 employees, with approximately 80% located in the United States. We also rely on a contingent hourly workforce to supplement our full-time workforce to meet fluctuating demand. We seek to create a high-performance culture that will drive and sustain enhanced value for all our stakeholders. To attract, retain and engage the talent needed, we strive to maintain a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with equitable opportunities for growth and development, supported by competitive compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities. 

Diversity and Inclusion

We believe that maintaining a diverse workforce and an inclusive environment for our workforce is important to our success. We celebrate a rich mix of countries, cultures, ages, races, ethnicities, gender identities, sexual orientation, abilities and perspectives that showcase our humanity, differentiate us as individuals and enhance our businesses. 

Employee Engagement and Development

We emphasize employee development and training and provide professional development initiatives, training, experiential learning and inclusion networks to our employees to enable them to advance their skills and achieve career goals. We also believe employee engagement is important to the company's success and conduct a survey annually that has driven participation rates with scores reflecting high levels of employee engagement. 

Health, Safety and Wellness

We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. 

In response to COVID-19, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, and the communities in which we operate, and which comply with local and federal government regulations. As the pandemic conditions change, we adapt our approach to keep our employees safe, including allowing them to work remotely when they do not need to be in any of our facilities and adapting our requirements around social distancing or the use of personal protective equipment. We have also 

6

taken steps to encourage-but not require-our employees to get vaccinated. We continuously monitor the rate of infection of our employees both overall and in specific facilities.

All of our offices and facilities are open for employees. There are some employees who have been working full-time in our offices and operating centers due to the nature of their work; some have chosen to come in regularly and others are predominantly working from home, coming into our office for purposeful activities. Over the course of the pandemic, we have been developing and will continue to adapt our workplace strategy to reflect the current changes in how people work. As we develop and adjust these approaches, we focus on doing so with an emphasis on maintaining a high level of performance while ensuring an inclusive and safe work environment. This approach provides a consistent framework for recognizing the evolving ways in which we work to deliver value to our stakeholders – warehouse employees who are onsite every day, service technicians, salespeople and drivers travelling to client sites, and office workers working in an array of flexible models. We continue to encourage our employees to get vaccinated, social distance where appropriate, provide and encourage the use of personal protective equipment and monitor the health of our employees. We expect to continue to implement safety measures as necessary and take further actions as government authorities require or recommend, or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers.
