ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments

In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange option contracts or forward contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 

Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows :

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 3, 2021, the total notional amounts of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, were $3.03 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $1.47 billion in Euros, $480 million in British Pounds, $448 million in Japanese Yen, $338 million in Australian Dollars and $299 million in other foreign currencies. As of December 3, 2021, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2022. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.

A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of December 3, 2021. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $172 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $76 million.

As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the

local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $749 million and $598 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.

We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.

Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue 

We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds, Japanese Yen and Australian Dollars. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.

We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended December 3, 2021, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities

Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At December 3, 2021, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.

Interest Rate Risk

Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities

At December 3, 2021, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.95 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of December 3, 2021, based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve. A 150 basis point increase in interest rates would lead to a $27 million decrease in the market value of our short-term investments. Conversely, a 150 basis point decrease in interest rates would lead to a $14 million increase in the market value of our short-term investments.

Senior Notes

As of December 3, 2021, we had $4.15 billion of senior notes outstanding which bear interest at fixed rates, and therefore do not subject us to financial statement risk associated with changes in interest rates. As of December 3, 2021, the total carrying amount of our senior notes was $4.12 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $4.29 billion.

See Note 17 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our senior notes.
