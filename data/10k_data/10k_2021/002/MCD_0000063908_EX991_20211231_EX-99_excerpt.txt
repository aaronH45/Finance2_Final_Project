(1)Based on debt obligations before the effects of fair value hedging adjustments and deferred debt costs. These effects are excluded as they have no impact on the obligation at maturity. See Debt Financing note to the consolidated financial statements.

(2)Includes the effect of interest rate swaps.

(1)The Operating lease interest is calculated using the Short-term and Long-term Lease liability amount multiplied by 3.7%, 3.8% and 4.0% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The rates represent the Company's weighted average discount rate used for leases that represents an estimate of the interest rate the Company would incur to borrow on a collateralized basis over the term of a lease within a particular currency environment.

(2)Calculated using the effective income tax rate for each year presented. The 2021 and 2019 amounts are calculated using the Non-GAAP tax rates previously disclosed on page 19 within the Consolidated Operating Results section of the Form 10-K. 

(3)The amounts for each year presented are calculated as the simple average of each of the previous four quarters.

Reconciliation of Returns on Incremental Invested Capital

ROIIC is a measure that evaluates the overall profitability of our markets and the effectiveness of capital deployed over one-year and three-year time periods. This measure is calculated using operating income and constant foreign exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency translation. The numerator is the Company’s incremental operating income plus depreciation and amortization from the base period.

The denominator is the weighted-average cash used for investing activities during the applicable one-or three-year period. The weighted-average cash used for investing activities is based on a weighting applied on a quarterly basis. These weightings are used to reflect the estimated contribution of each quarter’s investing activities to incremental operating income. For example, fourth quarter 2021 investing activities are weighted less because the assets purchased have only recently been deployed and would have generated little incremental operating income (12.5% of fourth quarter 2021 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations). In contrast, fourth quarter 2020 is heavily weighted because the assets purchased were deployed more than 12 months ago, and therefore have a full-year impact on 2021 operating income, with little or no impact to the base period (87.5% and 100.0% of fourth quarter 2020 investing activities are included in the one-year and three-year calculations, respectively). Cash used for investing activities can vary significantly by quarter, resulting in a weighted-average that may be higher or lower than the simple average of the periods presented. Management believes that weighting cash used for investing activities provides a more accurate reflection of the relationship between its investments and returns than a simple average.

The reconciliations to the most comparable measurements, in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., for the numerator and denominator of the one-year and three-year ROIIC are as follows:

(1)Represents the effect of foreign currency translation by translating results at an average exchange rate for the periods measured.

(2)Represents one-year and three-year, respectively, weighted-average cash used for investing activities, determined by applying the weightings below to the cash (provided by) used for investing activities for each quarter in the two-year and four-year periods ended December 31, 2021.

(3)Investing cash flows and Operating income related to significant transactions (primarily the sale of stock in McDonald's Japan) impacted the three-year ROIIC calculation by 9.9%. Excluding these items, three-year ROIIC was 18.8%.
