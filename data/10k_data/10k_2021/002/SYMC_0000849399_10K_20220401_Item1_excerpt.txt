Company Overview

NortonLifeLock has the largest consumer Cyber Safety platform in the world, empowering nearly 80 million users in more than 150 countries. 

Our business is built around consumers, we are a trusted brand for customers, and we are number one top of mind company in consumer Cyber Safety, according to the 2021 NortonLifeLock brand tracking study. 

Today’s world is increasingly digital, and this digital world has changed the way we live our lives every day. Between the massive shift to working and learning from home, and the ever-growing utility and opportunities to play and transact online, people’s digital lives have become the norm. With each new digital interaction comes increased risk for consumers, as cybercriminals look to take advantage of these accelerating trends. This is why we view ourselves as a trusted ally for our customers in a complex digital world and are committed to advancing our vision of protecting and empowering each element of their digital lives.

We are uniquely positioned for driving the awareness of Cyber Safety for individuals, fueled by an increasingly connected world. We maintain a global, multi-channel direct acquisition and brand marketing program. This program is designed to grow our customer base by increasing brand awareness and understanding of our products and services and maximizing our global reach to prospective customers.

We help prevent, detect and restore potential damages caused by many cyber criminals. We also make it easy for consumers to find, buy and use our products and services. To this end, we sell subscription-based Cyber Safety solutions primarily direct-to-consumer through our portfolio of websites and indirectly through partner relationships with retailers, telecom service providers, hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), strategic partners and employee benefit providers. Most of our subscriptions are sold on annual terms, but we also offer monthly subscriptions. As of April 1, 2022, we have nearly 80 million total users, which come from direct, indirect and freemium channels. Of the total users, we have over 23 million direct customers with whom we have a direct billing relationship.

•Direct-to-consumer channel: We use advertising and direct response marketing to elevate our brand, attract new customers and generate significant demand for our services. We have a direct billing relationship with these customers.

•Indirect partner distribution channels: We use strategic and affiliate partner distribution channels to refer prospective customers to us and expand our reach to our partners’ and affiliates’ customer bases. We developed and implemented a global partner sales organization that targets new, as well as existing, partners to enhance our partner distribution channels. These channels include retailers, telecom service providers, hardware OEMs, employee benefit providers, mobile app stores and strategic partners. Physical retail and OEM partners represent a small portion of our distribution, which minimizes the impact of supply chain disruptions.

•Freemium channel: With the acquisition of Avira, we have expanded our go-to-market with a freemium channel. We use free versions of our products to reach the broadest set of customers globally and bring Cyber Safety to a larger audience, especially in international markets. The free solution offers a baseline of protection and presents premium functionalities based on the risk profile and device-type of the user. The user can become a member of our paid customer base if they choose to add specific premium solutions or upgrade to Avira Prime, a suite of security and privacy solutions across multiple platforms and devices.

Seasonality

As is typical for many consumer technology companies, portions of our business are impacted by seasonality. However, we believe the net impact on our business is limited. Seasonal behavior in orders primarily reflects consumer spending patterns where our fiscal third and fourth quarters are higher due to the holidays in our third quarter, as well as follow-on holiday purchases and the U.S. tax filing season which typically is in our fourth quarter. Revenue generally reflects similar seasonal patterns but to a lesser extent than orders because of our subscription business model, as a large portion of our in-period revenues are recognized ratably from our deferred revenue balance.

Our Strategy

Our strategy is focused on profitable growth, allowing consumers to experience Cyber Safety. To fuel our growth, our consumer-centric strategy is to provide a comprehensive and easy-to-use integrated platform, which we have built in-house. By combining and leveraging our entire brand portfolio, including offerings from Norton, LifeLock, Avira and others, we are able to deliver an industry-leading set of Cyber Safety solutions. 

The key elements of our strategy include the following:

•Extend our leadership position through continued enhancement of our solutions and services: The Cyber Safety industry is large and expanding, which we believe provides a significant growth opportunity. Our strategy is to grow our business by investing in research and development and pursuing acquisitions, where appropriate, to expand the solutions and services we offer into new cohorts, territories and sectors. We believe there are many additional areas where we can both offer new solutions, as well as use our core capabilities and our integrated platform to reach new customers and markets globally.

•Grow our customer base through multiple channels: We have multiple go-to-market channels to reach new customers globally, including direct-to-customer, indirect partnerships and freemium. We intend to leverage our expertise in digital marketing, as well as existing and new strategic partnerships, to grow our customer base. We believe that continued investments in these areas, as well as our product offerings and infrastructure, will allow us to further enhance our leading brands and superior products, increase awareness of our consumer services and enhance our ability to efficiently acquire new customers. 

•Continue our focus on customer retention: We plan to invest in increasing customer retention by optimizing and expanding the value we provide to customers. We aim to continue to increase customer engagements through actionable alerts, education on timely topics and introducing new product capabilities. We plan to also continue investing in enhancing both desktop and mobile customer experiences throughout a customer’s journey with NortonLifeLock, from purchase, to onboarding and beyond. We aim to build long-term relationships with our customers and to provide our customers with the peace of mind and confidence they need to protect their digital lives.

•Increase value to existing customers: We believe strong customer satisfaction will provide us with the opportunity to engage customers in new services offerings. We maintain the Norton 360 platform, with multiple tiers of membership, and we are actively engaging with customers of standalone products to offer a Norton 360 membership. We also believe a substantial opportunity exists to increase the penetration of our premium-level consumer solutions. Over time, we plan to drive further growth as we add additional offerings and services for our customers.

•Draw strength from our world-class customer service support: We have the largest consumer Cyber Safety customer support organization in the world. Our global support team seeks to ensure the voice of the consumer is heard and that we put our customers first. We leverage frequent communication and feedback from our customers to continually improve our solutions and services. We embrace end-to-end customer experience and aim to continue to improve our Net Promoter Scores and overall customer satisfaction.

•Leverage our global brands to drive growth: We will work to keep building our trusted brands in markets globally as we strive to bring protection and empowerment to all consumers when it comes to their digital lives. According to our most recent research, Norton has 87% global brand awareness and 82% for device security. We are best positioned and number one top of mind in consumer Cyber Safety, according to the 2021 NortonLifeLock Brand Impact study. 

Our Cyber Safety Solutions and Services

Our vast portfolio of products and services are developed from consumer insights to help us bring to market real solutions to real problems and to raise the overall awareness of consumer Cyber Safety across all audiences. We continuously target to release new products and features at an accelerated pace and find synergies to integrate current and future technology acquisitions. 

Our full portfolio provides protection across three Cyber Safety categories in multiple channels and geographies, including security, identity protection, and online privacy. We have built a technology platform that brings together software and service capabilities into a comprehensive and easy-to-use integrated platform – it is called Norton 360. The Norton 360 integrated platform provides extensive Cyber Safety coverage to our members, delivering Cyber Safety subscription solutions with industry leading features, coupled with an integrated user experience. Through our platform, we aim for simplicity and peace of mind for the consumers. We also complement this Cyber Safety platform by offering adjacent trust-based solutions, which enables people to live their digital lives without compromising their security, identity or privacy.

5
We protect and empower consumers by providing solutions and services in two main ways:

•Comprehensive membership plans: Providing a complete Cyber Safety portfolio of solutions for a membership fee. Plans are offered through Norton 360 subscriptions, which include multiple levels of membership tiers that incorporate solutions from each of our key Cyber Safety categories: Security, Identity Protection and Online Privacy. We also offer solutions that target specific needs of consumers such as Norton Family and Norton 360 for Gamers. Norton Family brings the protection and security of our products to every member of the family across multiple devices and platforms. Norton 360 for Gamers is designed by gamers to help protect gamers; we aim to provide the protection and features gamers need the most, while minimizing interruptions to gaming. 

•Point solutions: Providing individual, stand-alone products and services in security, identity and privacy, which offers flexibility for consumers to choose between free or paid solutions. 

We are positioned across three key Cyber Safety categories:

•Security (Norton and Avira offerings): Our Norton 360 and Avira offerings provide real-time protection for PCs, Macs and mobile devices against malware, viruses, adware, ransomware and other online threats. These offerings monitor and block unauthorized traffic from the internet to the device to help protect private and sensitive information when customers are online. For mobile devices, Norton 360 for Mobile alerts customers of risky apps, safeguards against fraudulent and malicious websites, identifies Wi-Fi networks that are under attack, enables stolen device recovery and blocks unwanted spam and potential fraud calls. Norton 360 includes 24x7 support by trained support agents. We provide on-call support and offer a money-back guarantee if we cannot remove viruses from infected devices through our Virus Protection Promise. We also have Norton Utilities Ultimate, a performance offering that optimizes Windows PC capabilities for faster, smoother and more secure internet browsing, gaming or content streaming. This offering helps boost PC performance while also recovering lost files and protecting sensitive information.

•Identity Protection (Norton and LifeLock Identity Theft Protection, Dark Web Monitoring, Home Title Protect, Social Media Monitoring): Our Norton and LifeLock identity theft protection solution includes monitoring, alerts and restoration services to help safeguard our customers’ personal information. We monitor events that may present a risk of identity theft, such as new account openings and applications. If we detect that a customer’s personally identifiable information is being used, we deliver notifications and alerts to our customers about potentially suspicious activity. In the event of identity theft, we assign an Identity Restoration Specialist to work directly with customers to help restore their identities. Customers are further protected by our Million Dollar Protection Package, which provides reimbursement for stolen funds and coverage for personal expenses. Our Dark Web Monitoring product looks for personal information of our Norton 360 members on the Dark Web. We currently offer this product in many countries internationally and continue to add new countries each year. Our Home Title Protect product detects fraud and notifies members if we find changes made to their Home Title. Our Social Media Monitoring features help keep customers’ social media accounts safer by monitoring them for account takeovers, risky activity and inappropriate content. Social Media Monitoring keeps a pulse on customers’ social media accounts, notifying them of suspected account compromise or potentially risky links in their account feed.

6
•Online Privacy (VPN, Privacy Monitor Assistant, AntiTrack, Online Reputation Management): As people are exchanging more sensitive information through digital channels, such as personal healthcare information to enable tele-health or financial information for personal accounting, having a VPN has become even more crucial. Our VPN solution enhances security and online privacy by providing an encrypted data tunnel. This allows customers to securely transmit and access private information, such as passwords, bank details and credit card numbers, when using public Wi-Fi on PCs, Macs and mobile iOS and Android devices. Our VPN service allows customers to browse the Web anonymously to protect their online privacy and prevent tracking by online advertisers and other companies. Customers can also change their virtual location when they are traveling internationally to allow them to connect to their favorite apps, websites and online streaming services as if they are in their home country. Our Privacy Monitor Assistant is an on-demand, white glove service where our agents help our members delete personal information from Data brokers online. Our AntiTrack product helps keep personal information and browsing activity private by blocking trackers and disguising digital fingerprints online. This allows customers to browse anonymously and go beyond clearing cookies to obscure digital fingerprints. Our Online Reputation Management solutions help extend and strengthen NortonLifeLock’s privacy capabilities and functionalities, such as the ability to manage online search results, personal branding and digital privacy. These solutions can help our customers control their search results by promoting positive search results or suppressing incorrect search results, or help our customers protect their family’s privacy by hiding or removing sensitive personal information.

Innovation and Research & Development

NortonLifeLock has a long history of innovation, and we plan to continue to invest in research and development to drive our long-term success.

As cyber threats evolve, we are focused on delivering a portfolio that protects each element of our customers’ digital lives. To do this, we engage and listen to our customers, and we embrace innovation by deploying a global research and development strategy across our Cyber Safety platform. Our engineering and product management teams are focused on delivering new versions of existing offerings, as well as developing entirely new offerings to drive the company’s global leadership in Cyber Safety. 

We are committed to our innovation and research & development efforts. Norton Labs, a global team of experts, is leading the company’s future technology and helping guide the consumer cybersecurity industry. Within Norton Labs, our global technology research organization is focused on applied research projects, with the goal of rapidly creating new products to address consumer trends and grow the business, including defending consumer digital privacy and identity. We also have a global threat response and security technology organization that is comprised of leading threat and security researchers, supported by advanced systems to innovate security technology and threat intelligence. 

Industry Overview & Market Opportunity

Cyber Safety is a growing market, fueled by the increase in activities online over the years as well as the years ahead. The core markets that we participate in are security, identity and privacy. We believe the Cyber Safety market will continue to expand beyond these core markets and grow significantly, driven by the growing number of people connected to the Internet who have a digital life.

The cyber threat landscape is larger and more complicated than ever before, exposing consumers to an increased risk to their digital lives. The digitization of the world and the overlap between the physical and digital world is growing at a fast pace. New technologies, smart devices, digital identities and an increasingly more connected world means consumers will encounter a range of new Cyber Safety challenges. Consumer demands and behaviors are rapidly changing and driving more activities online, from shopping, socializing, working, banking, to other activities in healthcare, entertainment and so much more. Almost every aspect of a person’s life has a digital component. Unfortunately, many of those activities are left unprotected, and attackers are exploiting this larger opportunity and the inherent security and privacy vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals have not only expanded their reach, but the sophistication of digital threats and attacks are becoming increasingly more consumer-related.

Cybercrime, and the ways in which cybercriminals target consumers, continue to evolve along with behaviors and technology. Cybercrime encompasses any crime committed with devices over the internet and includes crimes where (i) malicious software or unauthorized access is detected on a device, network or online account (such as email, social media, online banking, crypto currency, online retail, gaming, online entertainment, etc.), and unauthorized access or connection to cloud service accounts; (ii) an individual is digitally victimized through a data breach, cyber theft, cyber extortion, or fraud (stolen personally identifiable information, identity theft, etc.); (iii) online stalking, bullying, or harassment is inflicted; or (iv) attacks related to privacy or disinformation (such as online tracking protection, identity impersonation, disinformation on social media, DeepFakes, non-trustworthy WiFi network, EvilTwin attacks, etc.). 

As cybercrime becomes an intensifying threat to our world, consumers are increasingly concerned. Our annual Norton Cyber Safety Insights Report examines the impact of cybercrime and consumers’ online behaviors and concerns related to their online security, privacy and identity. According to the 2022 report, which is based on research conducted online by The Harris Poll on behalf of us, more than 415 million people across 10 countries were victims of cybercrime and more than 81 million people were victims of identity theft over the past year. Cybercrime victims collectively spent nearly 4.4 billion hours trying to resolve their issues and half of these victims were impacted financially.

Competitive Landscape

We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment. We face global competition from a broad range of companies, including software vendors focusing on Cyber Safety solutions, operating system providers such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, and ‘pure play’ companies that currently specialize in one or a few particular segments of the market and many of which are expanding their product portfolios into different segments. We believe the competitive factors in our market include innovation, access to a breadth of identity and consumer transaction data, broad and effective service offerings, brand recognition, technology, effective and cost-efficient customer acquisition, having a strong retention rate, customer satisfaction, price, convenience of purchase, ease of use, frequency of upgrades and updates and quality and reliable customer service. Our competitors may vary by offering, geography, business model and channel. 

Our principal competitors are set forth below: 

•Security: Our principal competitors in this segment include Apple, Avast, Bitdefender, Google, Kaspersky, McAfee, Microsoft and Trend Micro. 

•Identity Protection: Our principal competitors in this segment include credit bureaus such as Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, as well as certain credit monitoring and identity theft protection solutions from others such as Allstate, Aura and Credit Karma.

•Online Privacy: Our principal competitors in this segment include Aura (which recently acquired Pango), Avast, Kape (which recently purchased ExpressVPN), NordVPN (now NordSecurity), Life360 and Bark.

•Other Competitors: In addition to competition from independent software vendors such as Avast, Bitdefender, Kaspersky, McAfee and Trend Micro, and from OS providers such as Apple, Google and Microsoft, we also face competition from other companies that currently focus on one or a few Cyber Safety or adjacent segments but are developing additional competing products and expanding their portfolios into new segments, such as ‘pure play’ companies, ISPs, big tech platform providers, insurance companies and financial service organizations. 

We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the strength of our technology, people, product offerings and presence in all of the current key Cyber Safety categories. However, some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution or other resources than we do, including in new Cyber Safety and digital life segments we may enter, which consequently affords them competitive advantages. As a result, they may be able to devote greater resources to develop, promote and sell their offerings; deliver competitive offerings at lower prices or for free; and introduce new solutions and respond to market developments and customer requirements and preferences more quickly or cost effectively than we can. In addition, for individual solutions or features, smaller, well-funded competitors may be able to innovate and adapt more nimbly to the dynamic nature of the market and shift consumer needs.

For more information on the risks associated with our competitors, please see “Risk Factors” – Risks Related to Our Business Strategy and Industry – “We operate in a highly competitive and dynamic environment, and if we are unable to compete effectively, we could experience a loss in market share and a reduction in revenue” and “We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfully,” in Item 1A included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

Building a brand centered on trust is critically important, and our focus on corporate responsibility helps us earn trust from our users, employees, investors and shareholders. As such, environmental, social and governance topics are core to our business strategy:

•Environment: Protecting our planet is fundamental to ensuring a safe and sustainable future. We work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from our operations through operational efficiencies, reduce the environmental footprint of our products across their lifecycle through innovative approaches to product development and packaging, promote high standards for environmental stewardship in our supply chain and engage with employees and environmental partners to amplify our work. We believe we can contribute to a future where the natural world is thriving and call these efforts Environmental Stewardship.

•Social: We are proud to support the communities where our team members live and work. Our community impact programs include employee volunteering and giving, product donations, signature programs that leverage our unique expertise in increasing digital safety literacy, and corporate philanthropic giving focused on digital safety education; diversity, equity, and inclusion; environmental action; and disaster response. We also support diversity, equity, and inclusion and employee engagement, discussed in more detail in the Human Capital Management subsection.

•Governance: Governance covers many core operating principles overseen by the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors. This committee has oversight of Corporate Responsibility issues and receives quarterly updates on topics such as diversity, ethics, environmental stewardship and community investment. Our global culture of responsibility, and the positive contributions we make to the customers, employees, communities, and other stakeholders that we serve drives value for our business. 

Setting strategic, achievable, and business-aligned corporate responsibility objectives helps to guide our work and improves our company performance. We align our objectives with the company’s financial goals and focus on the unique positive social and environmental impacts that our business model can have on the world.

8
Our objectives include:

•Data Privacy and Protection: We safeguard our customer, partner and employee data and offer products, including Norton Privacy Monitor Assistant that help consumers protect their personal data wherever it is found.

•Cyber Safety: We leverage our leading expertise and technology in Cyber Safety to protect communities. Malicious phone and computer applications, known as stalkerware, are used to harass, control and harm people. We are a founding member of the Coalition Against Stalkerware and donate products to victims to help keep their personal data protected. We also provide Cyber Safety training to help empower victims and survivors to reduce their vulnerability. Additional examples of our efforts include our partnership with the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts on the Surf Smart program to empower girls to keep themselves and others safe online and The Smart Talk, a free tool co-created in partnership with National PTA.

•Diversity, Equity & Inclusion in Technology: We are focused on bringing more women and under-represented groups into cybersecurity and tech. We do this by investing in high-impact, nonprofit organizations. We have made a three-year commitment to the Reboot Representation tech coalition, which is dedicated to doubling the number of Black, Latina and Native American women graduating with computing degrees by 2025. We also support Women4Cyber in Europe and the NASSCOM Foundation’s Cyber Security Skills Development Initiative for Women in India. In fiscal 2022, approximately 62% of NortonLifeLock Foundation grants across all objectives had a focus on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.

•Employee Volunteering & Giving: We have created a variety of opportunities for employee volunteering and giving and work to increase employee participation rates. In fiscal 2021, we launched a virtual volunteer program with team building opportunities and joint events with our Diversity and Inclusion Communities. We offer employees paid time off to volunteer, have an employee matching gift program and provide dollars-for-doers grants to encourage volunteer service. Our employee participation rate in our volunteering and giving program was 41% in fiscal 2022.

•Environmental Stewardship: We finalized and launched our new environmental strategy, which focuses on climate and energy, sustainable products, our supply chain, engagement with employees and nonprofit partners and being transparent about our progress and commitments.

Our annual ESG and Corporate Responsibility Report can be found via the NortonLifeLock website at https://www.nortonlifelock.com/about/corporate-responsibility.

Human Capital Management

 Our human capital management strategy reflects our unique values and growth mindset. Working in close partnership with our Board of Directors on our talent management strategy, we work hard to lead, develop and grow our diverse team. We strive to be a diverse, vibrant community with strong values and a shared commitment to each other, the work we do and the world we all share. 

At NortonLifeLock, our mission is to build a comprehensive and easy-to-use integrated portfolio that prevents, detects and responds to cyber threats and cybercrimes in today’s digital world. Our success in helping achieve this mission depends, in large part, on the success of our employees. 

•General Employee Demographics: As of April 1, 2022, we employed nearly 2,700 employees in 24 countries worldwide, with approximately 1,200 located in the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We are focused on attracting, developing, rewarding and retaining a diverse and truly global team. The Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of our Board of Directors oversees senior management compensation and development, and our Board is invested in our talent management strategies, including DEI, culture and engagement.

•Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI): Our mission is to increase our global representation of underrepresented groups at all levels (diversity), where everyone has an opportunity for development and advancement (equity) and is able to bring their whole selves to work and feel valued every day (inclusion). This mission is built upon four foundational pillars: (1) measurement and accountability; (2) fostering an inclusive environment; (3) diversifying our workforce; and (4) employee development and retention, which are designed to support, attract, retain and develop the best talent.

Clear and actionable multi-year representation goals are set at the leadership level, and tracking the data regularly to assess our progress and drive accountability go hand in hand. We ask applicants, new hires and employees to self-identify not only their demographics, but also important characteristics to help us better measure the diversity of our applicant pool and of our team to derive insights and actionable people strategies. In fiscal 2022, we publicly disclosed our most recent US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEO-1 Component 1 Data Collection Report on our investor relations website located at https://investor.nortonlifelock.com/governance/governance-documents/.

Inclusion is something we strive for and invest in every day. Raising awareness and appreciation of various diversity topics via our learning curriculum, global all employee conversations, published Blogs and active employee engagement. We measure belonging as a key metric in our quarterly NGage employee surveys. We are proud to support our several employee resource groups communities for people to come together as allies, to learn, support, mentor, and celebrate with one another and to provide an environment where everyone feels seen, heard, respected and valued.

9
Diversity is a key pillar of our talent management strategy. As of April 1, 2022, women represented 33% of our workforce and held positions in 33% of our leadership. In addition, as of April 1, 2022, women represented 44% of our Board of Directors and half of our independent board membership. We partner with Work180, a women-focused recruitment site that only lists career opportunities from employers that support diversity, inclusion and flexibility. We post positions on several diverse recruiting sites, including Black Tech Jobs, Jobs for Her and Women Who Code. 

As part of our ongoing focus on employee development, we extended our participation in McKinsey & Company’s Connected Leaders Academy for our Asian, Black and Hispanic-Latino leaders. Additionally, we had women globally attend the Women in Tech conference and several employees attended the Out & Equal Global Workplace Summit.

•Employee Development, Engagement and Training: We increased our investment in learning and development in fiscal 2022, launching Nvest Learning programs for all employees leveraging an extensive breadth of content and learning opportunities. This umbrella of offerings includes Nvest Mentorship, Nvest eLearning and Nvest NLOK University. 

Our homegrown Nvest Mentorship program and platform continued to grow and now boasts over 200 active mentors and mentees. Nvest eLearning, a collection of digital, on-demand modules categorized around leadership, health and wellness, business skills, and technical skills, launched in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 with a steady increase in participation during the year with over 600 individual learners. We also provide group learning designed around TED Talks on topics including leadership, change management and further diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

Nvest NLOK University (Nvest NU) launched in the third quarter of fiscal 2022 and is a leadership program that offers best-in-class content from Harvard ManageMentor that inspires, engages and invests in current and emerging leaders by leveraging 42 course options and group learning opportunities. Hundreds of recognition badges and certificates have been awarded to recognize various levels of achievement.

Feedback from our employees is critical, and we have developed an ongoing dialogue with our teams via our quarterly Ngage pulse survey on a targeted topic that drives actions and improvements.

•Human Capital Governance: We partner closely with our Board of Directors and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee on our strategies and objectives related to talent management, talent acquisition, leadership development, retention and succession, DEI and employee engagement.

Intellectual Property

We are a leader amongst Cyber Safety solutions for consumers in pursuing patents and currently have a portfolio of over 1,000 U.S. and international patents issued with many pending. We protect our intellectual property rights and investments in a variety of ways to safeguard our technologies and our long-term success. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to ensure the enforcement of copyright, trademark, trade secret and other protections that apply to our software products and services. The term of the patents we hold is, on average, twelve years. From time to time, we enter into cross-license agreements with other technology companies covering broad groups of patents; we have an additional portfolio of over 2,100 U.S. and international patents cross-licensed to us as part of our arrangement with Broadcom as a result of the asset sale of our former Enterprise Security business. 

Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available, and the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results. 

In addition, companies in the technology industry may own a large number of patents, copyrights and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. 

For more information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Information Security and Risk Oversight

We maintain a comprehensive technology and cybersecurity program to ensure our systems are effective and prepared for information security risks, including regular oversight of our programs for security monitoring for internal and external threats to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of our information assets. We regularly perform evaluations of our security program and continue to invest in our capabilities to keep customers, employees and critical assets safe. Our Head of Cyber Security is ultimately responsible for our cybersecurity program, which includes the implementation of controls aligned with industry guidelines and applicable statutes and regulations to identify threats, detect attacks and protect these information assets. We have implemented security monitoring capabilities designed to alert us to suspicious activity and developed an incident response program that includes periodic testing and is designed to restore business operations as quickly and as orderly as possible in the event of a breach. In addition, employees participate in an ongoing program of mandatory annual training and receive communications regarding the cybersecurity environment to increase awareness throughout the company. We also implemented an enhanced annual training program for specific specialized employee populations, including secure coding training.

Recently, our Board of Directors established a Technology and Cybersecurity Committee of the Board with direct oversight to the Company’s (1) technology strategy, initiatives and investments and (2) key cybersecurity information technology risks against 

10
both internal and external threats. The Technology and Cybersecurity Committee is comprised entirely of independent directors, two of whom have significant work experience related to information security issues or oversight. Management will report security instances to the committee as they occur, if material, and will provide a summary multiple times per year to the Committee. Additionally, our Head of Cyber Security meets regularly with the Board of Directors or the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to brief them on technology and information security matters. We carry insurance that provides protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident. In the last three years, the expenses we have incurred from information security breach incidences were immaterial. This includes penalties and settlements, of which there were none.

Governmental Regulation

We collect, use, store or disclose an increasingly high volume, variety and velocity of personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business, particularly, in relation to our identity and information protection offerings, which rely on large data repositories of personal information and consumer transactions. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security. 

For information on the risks associated with complying with privacy and data security laws, please see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
