Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA

If CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves which would result in a charge to CNA’s earnings.

CNA maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain. These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events. Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, economic, social and medical inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.

There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in economic and social inflation, and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period. Certain risks and uncertainties associated with CNA’s insurance reserves are outlined in the Insurance Reserves and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of MD&A in Item 7.

CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. Further, the impact of social inflation continues to be significant, and the trajectory of its future impact remains uncertain. These issues, as well as social inflation, have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves. The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict and may be material.

In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA continually reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If CNA’s recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against its earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

CNA’s actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.

CNA’s active life reserves for long term care policies are based on CNA’s best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2020, due to a reserve unlocking at that date. Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases.

Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain, because the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and CNA’s future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add reserves. The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against its earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial. See the Life & Group Policyholder Reserves portion of the Insurance Reserves section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.

Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.

A prolonged period during which investment returns remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA’s reserving discount rate assumptions could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA’s obligations under long term care policies, which may require increases to its reserves. This risk is more significant for CNA’s long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which CNA discounts its reserves. In 

16
addition, CNA may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases it requests. Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in CNA’s reserving assumptions may require an increase to its reserves.

CNA is vulnerable to material losses from natural and man-made disasters.

Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow.

The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Further, significant catastrophic events or a series of catastrophic events have the potential to impose financial stress on the reinsurance industry, which could impact CNA’s ability to collect amounts owed to CNA by reinsurers, thereby resulting in higher net incurred losses.

Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. CNA’s principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (“TRIPRA”) through December 31, 2027. However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations. It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect CNA’s business by increasing its exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering its business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure. For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance.

As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate, could cause CNA to exhaust its available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance. Accordingly, catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

The COVID-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of the virus have resulted in increased claims and related litigation risk across CNA’s enterprise, which may continue to have adverse impacts on its business, results of operations and financial condition and could be material.

CNA has experienced, and may continue to experience, increased claim submissions and litigation related to denial of claims based on policy coverage, or the facts of the claim, in certain lines of business that are implicated by the pandemic and mitigating actions taken by its customers and governmental authorities in response to its spread. These lines include primarily healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, commercial property-related business interruption coverage, management liability (directors and officers, employment practices, and professional liability lines) and trade credit. CNA recorded significant losses during 2020, the majority of which are classified as incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) reserves, in these areas and may experience continued losses, which could be material. 

Increased frequency or severity in any or all of the foregoing lines, or others where the exposure has yet to emerge, may have a material impact on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

CNA has incurred and may continue to incur substantial expenses related to litigation activity in connection with COVID-related legal claims. These actions primarily relate to denial of claims submitted as a result of the pandemic and the mitigating actions under commercial property policies for business interruption coverage, including lockdowns and closing of certain businesses. The significance of such litigation, both in substance and volume, and the resultant activities CNA has initiated, including external counsel engagement, and the costs related thereto, may have a material impact on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

17
CNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.

CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.

On August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (“loss portfolio transfer” or “LPT”). The cumulative amount ceded under the loss portfolio transfer as of December 31, 2021 is $3.4 billion. If the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the loss portfolio transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against earnings. These charges could be substantial. Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the loss portfolio transfer, CNA will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO. Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce CNA’s earnings.

CNA is exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from its insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.

CNA faces potential exposure to various types of new and emerging mass tort claims including, those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes, including New York reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change. Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new claimant activity. Emerging mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation could have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

CNA faces intense competition in its industry; it may be adversely affected by the cyclical nature of the property and casualty business and the evolving landscape of its distribution network.

All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services to remain competitive. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than CNA does, for both distributors and customers. This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with CNA to the extent that they continue to have direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk. Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, such as insuretech firms, resulting in increased pressures on CNA’s ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to CNA’s customer base and risk appropriate to CNA.

In addition, the property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. During periods in which price competition is high, CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, CNA’s premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.

CNA markets its insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of CNA’s competitors. Any change in CNA’s relationships with its distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters, including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of CNA’s competitors’ products, could adversely affect CNA’s ability to sell its products. As a result, CNA’s business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

18
CNA’s underwriting strategies currently rely on the effectiveness of reinsurance arrangements and CNA accordingly faces risks relating to reinsurance, including obtaining reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions it deems acceptable, reinsurance counterparty risk and ineffective reinsurance coverage.

A primary reason CNA purchases reinsurance is to manage its exposure to risk, thereby facilitating its underwriting strategies in certain key areas. Under CNA’s ceded reinsurance arrangements, a reinsurer assumes a specified portion of its exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the volatility of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions it deems acceptable, CNA’s risk exposure will not be mitigated or it may forego such increased risk, thereby adversely impacting its underwriting strategies. In addition, use of reinsurance exposes CNA to credit risk of the reinsurers, as the reinsurance arrangements do not relieve it of the liability to the customer. If a reinsurer is unable to meet its financial obligations under a reinsurance arrangement, CNA will remain obligated under the original policies issued to its customers. Furthermore, while CNA uses various risk management methods, including the use of reinsurance, to effectively manage risk, there is the possibility that one or more natural catastrophes and/or terrorism or other events could result in claims substantially exceeding expectations, thereby making the reinsurance strategy significantly less effective. Such reinsurance-related risks could have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition and adversely affect its underwriting strategies in certain lines of business. 

CNA may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.

Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and CNA’s ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks. For example, more insurers are utilizing “big data” analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing. If such utilization is more effective than how CNA uses similar data and information, CNA will be at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that CNA will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly this may have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing. For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact CNA’s competitive position. CNA’s efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact CNA’s business relationships with independent agents and brokers who currently market its products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.

CNA may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.

CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable. Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors. Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the value of its investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which it discounts certain liabilities. CNA’s investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of CNA’s investment portfolio that is carried at fair value in the financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.

CNA has significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing CNA’s net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of its existing fixed maturity investments, which could reduce CNA’s net unrealized gains included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”). The value of CNA’s fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments CNA holds or in the underlying collateral of the security.

19
In addition, CNA invests a portion of its assets in limited partnerships and common stock which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed maturity investments. Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments, which may also limit CNA’s ability to withdraw funds from these investments. The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.

Further, CNA holds a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans. CNA is subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of the underlying properties, where lease payments directly service the loan. Any changes in actual or expected collections would result in a charge to earnings.

As a result of these factors, CNA may not earn an adequate return on its investments, may be required to write down the value of its investments and may incur losses on the disposition of its investments, all of which could materially adversely affect CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

CNA uses analytical models to assist its decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving, catastrophe risks and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.

CNA uses various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with its assets and liabilities. This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist CNA in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things. CNA incorporates numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others. The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis. Further, climate change may make modeled outcomes less certain or produce new, non-modeled risks.

In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks, including the improper use of the model, input errors, data errors and human error. As a result, actual results may differ materially from CNA’s modeled results. CNA’s profitability and financial condition substantially depends on the extent to which its actual experience is consistent with the assumptions CNA uses in its models and ultimate model outputs. If, based upon these models or other factors, CNA misprices its products or fails to appropriately estimate the risks it is exposed to, its business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.

Any significant interruption in the operation of CNA’s business functions, facilities and systems or its vendors’ facilities and systems could result in a materially adverse effect on its operations.

CNA’s business is highly dependent upon its ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted manner, through its employees or vendor relationships and using its and its vendor’s facilities and systems, necessary business functions, such as internet support and 24-hour call centers, processing new and renewal business, providing customer service, processing and paying claims and other obligations and issuing financial statements.

CNA’s, or its vendors’, facilities and systems could become unavailable, inoperable, or otherwise impaired from a variety of causes, including natural events, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, severe winter weather and fires, or other events, such as explosions, terrorist attacks, computer security breaches or cyber attacks, riots, hazardous material releases, medical epidemics or pandemics, utility outages, interruptions of data processing and storage systems or unavailability of communications facilities. An interruption in CNA’s system availability occurred in March 2021 as a result of a cybersecurity attack sustained by CNA. Please refer to the immediately following risk factor for further information regarding this incident. Likewise, CNA could experience a significant failure, interruption or corruption of one or more of its vendors’ information technology, telecommunications, or other systems for various reasons, including significant failures or interruptions that might occur as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. The shut-down or unavailability of one or more of CNA’s or its vendors’ systems or facilities for these or any other reasons could significantly impair CNA’s ability to perform critical business functions in a timely basis.

In addition, because CNA’s information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, CNA could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or a third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. If sustained or repeated, such events could result in a deterioration of CNA’s ability to perform necessary business functions.

20
The foregoing risks could expose CNA to monetary and reputational damages. Potential exposures resulting from the March 2021 cybersecurity attack, described in the immediately following risk factor, as well as any future incidents may include substantially increased compliance costs, as well as increased costs relating to investments in computer system and security-related upgrades, with those costs potentially not recoverable under relevant insurance coverage. CNA anticipates making continued investments to improve its security and infrastructure which are not recoverable under relevant insurance coverage. If CNA’s business continuity plans or system security do not sufficiently address these risks, they could have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Any significant breach in CNA’s data security infrastructure or its vendors’ facilities and systems could disrupt business, cause financial losses and damage its reputation, and insurance coverage may not be available for claims related to a breach.

A significant breach of CNA’s data security infrastructure may result from actions by its employees, vendors, third-party administrators, or unknown third parties or through cyber attacks. The risk of a breach can exist whether software services are in CNA’s data centers or are cloud-based software services. Breaches have occurred, and may occur again, in CNA’s systems and in the systems of its vendors and third party administrators.

Such a breach could affect CNA’s data framework or cause a failure to protect the personal information of its customers, claimants or employees, or sensitive and confidential information regarding its business and may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to its reputation. The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws, as well as evolving regulation in this regard. During the third quarter of 2021, CNA was notified of a breach of certain systems of a third party administrator, which resulted in breach notifications sent by such administrator to potentially impacted persons, including a limited number of CNA’s claimants. While CNA does not believe such notifications and resultant actions will have a material adverse effect on its business, this or similar incidents, or any other such breach of CNA’s or its vendors’ data security infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

CNA sustained a sophisticated cybersecurity attack in March 2021 involving ransomware that caused a network disruption and impacted certain of its systems. Upon detection, CNA undertook steps to address the incident, including engaging a team of third-party forensic experts and notifying law enforcement and key regulators. CNA restored network systems and resumed normal operations. CNA is continuing to assess all actions that it will take to improve its existing systems.

CNA’s investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, contractor workers and their dependents and certain other persons, including some policyholders. In July 2021, CNA provided notifications to the impacted individuals and to regulators, in accordance with applicable law. Although CNA currently has no indication that the impacted data has been misused, or that CNA or its policyholder data was specifically targeted by the unauthorized third party, it may be subject to subsequent investigations, claims or actions in addition to other costs, fines, penalties, or other obligations related to impacted data, whether or not such data is misused. In addition, the misuse, or perceived misuse, of sensitive or confidential information regarding its business or policyholders could cause harm to CNA’s reputation and result in the loss of business with existing or potential customers, which could adversely impact its business, results of operations and financial condition.

Although CNA maintains cybersecurity insurance coverage insuring against costs resulting from cyber attacks (including the March 2021 attack), CNA does not expect the amount available under its coverage policy to cover all losses. Costs and expenses incurred and likely to be incurred by CNA in connection with the March 2021 attack include both direct and indirect costs and are not all covered by its insurance coverage. In addition, potential disputes with its insurers about the availability of insurance coverage for claims relating to the March 2021 attack or any future incident could occur. Further, as a result of the March 2021 attack, CNA incurred higher costs for the replenishment of its current policy through the end of the term, and CNA believes it will incur higher costs for future cybersecurity insurance coverage beyond the current term.

Based on the information currently known, CNA does not believe that the March 2021 cybersecurity attack will have a material impact on its business, results of operations or financial condition, but no assurances can be given as it continues to assess the full impact from the incident, including costs, expenses and insurance coverage. CNA may also be subject to future incidents that could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition or may result in operational impairments and financial losses, as well as significant harm to CNA’s reputation.

21
Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on CNA’s behalf could result in a material adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

CNA may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional, negligent or inadvertent misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. CNA’s or its third party service providers’ controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of such non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. Any losses relating to such non-compliant activity could adversely affect CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

Portions of CNA’s insurance business are underwritten and serviced by third parties. With respect to underwriting, CNA’s contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations, including requiring them to underwrite within the terms of CNA’s licenses. Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, CNA could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements. It is possible that in such circumstance CNA might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.

Additionally, CNA relies on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of its long term care claims, to handle policyholder services and perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions. Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against CNA and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure.

CNA has also licensed certain systems from third parties. CNA cannot be certain that it will have access to these systems or that its information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended.

These risks could adversely impact CNA’s reputation and client relationships and have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition.

CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.

Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd’s, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction’s regulatory capital adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves or the occurrence of a catastrophic event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates its capital position, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.

The IAIS has adopted a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups and continues to develop a group basis ICS. The NAIC is also developing a group capital standard that is intended to be comparable to the ICS. The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase CNA’s prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase its cost of regulatory compliance.

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.

CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction. If CNA is restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, CNA may not be able to fund its corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay stockholder dividends from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to pursue other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.

22
Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA, adversely affecting its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all and increasing its cost of capital.

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”), S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”). Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders, and may also reflect opinions on other areas such as information security and ESG matters. 

The rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves. Further, if one or more of CNA’s corporate debt ratings were downgraded, CNA may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and may incur higher borrowing costs.

In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances. For further discussion of CNA’s ratings, see the Subsidiaries portion of the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of MD&A in Item 7.

CNA is subject to extensive existing state, local, federal and foreign governmental regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues; additional regulation or significant modification to existing regulations or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may have a materially adverse effect on CNA’s business, results of operations and financial condition.

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders and third-party claimants rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA conducts its business. Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on CNA. In addition, the Lloyd’s marketplace sets rules under which its members, including CNA’s Hardy syndicate, operate.

These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers. In addition, rules and regulations have recently been introduced, or are being considered, in the areas of information security and ESG, which may also affect CNA’s business.

Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible or restrict CNA from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipelines

Boardwalk Pipelines’ natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including rules and regulations related to the rates it can charge for its services and its ability to construct or abandon facilities. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be able to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including the types, rates and terms of services Boardwalk Pipelines may offer to its customers, construction of new 

23
facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities and recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. An adverse FERC action in any of these areas could affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to the FERC’s regulations. The FERC can also deny Boardwalk Pipelines the right to abandon certain facilities from service.

The FERC regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations. For cost-based services, the FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge. The basic elements that the FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be able to recover its costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity, through existing or future rates.

The FERC and/or Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers could challenge the maximum applicable rates that any of its regulated pipelines can charge in accordance with Section 5 of the NGA. Adoption of potential legislation that would amend Section 5 of the NGA to add refund provisions could increase the likelihood of such a challenge. If such a challenge is successful for any of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines, the revenues associated with transportation and storage services the pipeline provides pursuant to cost-of-service rates could materially decrease in the future, which would adversely affect the revenues on that pipeline going forward.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, and those of Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers, are subject to a series of risks regarding climate change.

The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the U.S. and in other countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional, state and local levels of government to monitor, limit and eliminate both existing and future emissions of GHGs. These proposals expose Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations as well as the operations of its fossil fuel producer customers to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks.

In the U.S., no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. However, the EPA has issued several rules regulating GHGs following the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHGs are air pollutants under the CAA and the EPA’s own endangerment finding for certain GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane. The EPA regulates GHGs through various requirements, including permitting for GHG emissions from large stationary sources, annual reporting on GHG emissions from oil and gas facilities, New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) restricting methane emissions from new facilities in the natural gas sector, and GHG emissions limits on vehicles together with the DOT. The EPA’s regulation of methane emissions continues to undergo significant changes. In June 2021, President Biden signed into law a joint resolution of Congress under the Congressional Review Act that rescinded the EPA’s 2020 Policy Rule, effectively reinstating the 2012 and 2016 NSPS for the transmission and storage sector. In November 2021, the EPA proposed a rule to establish standards of performance for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from new sources and, for the first time, existing sources, within the crude oil and natural gas source category, including the transmission and storage sector. The proposed rule includes several requirements relevant to Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, including stricter emissions limits for various facilities and equipment (including pneumatic controllers, storage tanks, reciprocating compressors and wet seal centrifugal compressors), more frequent leak detection and monitoring of fugitive emissions from compressor stations, and deadlines for repairing fugitive emissions. The EPA plans to issue a supplemental proposal containing proposed regulations in 2022 and aims to finalize the rule by the end of 2022.

Governmental entities, including certain states and groups of states, have adopted or are considering legislation, regulations or other initiatives such as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and emissions limits. At the international level, in February 2021 the U.S. rejoined the Paris Agreement, which requires member nations to submit non-binding GHG emissions reduction goals every five years. In April 2021, President Biden announced a new target for the U.S. to reduce GHG emissions 50-52% from 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the U.S. joined other nations for the 26th Conference to the Parties (COP26), during which nations including the U.S. made various commitments, including the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions 30% from 2020 levels by 2030.

Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the U.S. The Biden administration and future administrations could take various actions to curtail oil and natural gas production and transportation, including limiting fracturing of oil and natural gas wells, restricting flaring and venting during natural gas production on federal properties, limiting or banning oil and gas leases on federal lands and offshore waters, increasing requirements for construction and permitting of pipeline infrastructure and 

24
LNG export facilities, and further restricting GHG emissions from oil and gas facilities. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other governmental entities have brought suit alleging that fossil fuel producers created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects such as rising sea levels, are responsible for associated roadway and infrastructure damage, or defrauded investors or customers by failing to timely and adequately disclose adverse effects of climate change. 

There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel energy companies as investors become increasingly concerned about the potential effects of climate change and may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices that favor alternative power sources (such as wind, solar, geothermal, tidal and biofuels), making those sources more attractive, and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Many of the largest U.S. banks have made “net zero” carbon emission commitments and have announced that they will be assessing financed emissions across their portfolios and taking steps to quantify and reduce those emissions. At COP26, the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero announced that commitments from over 450 firms across 45 countries had resulted in over $130 trillion in capital committed to net zero goals. Financial institutions could be required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies. In late 2020 the Federal Reserve joined the Network for Greening the Financial System (“NGFS”), a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector, and in 2021 the Federal Reserve issued a statement supporting the efforts of NGFS in identifying potential solutions for climate-related challenges relevant to central banks and supervisory authorities. While Boardwalk Pipelines cannot predict what policies may result from these announcements, a material reduction in the capital available to the fossil fuel industry could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream energy business activities, which could adversely impact its business and operations. Separately, the SEC has also announced that it is scrutinizing existing climate-change related disclosures in public filings, increasing the potential for enforcement if the SEC were to allege an issuer’s existing climate disclosures are misleading or deficient.

The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal, regional, state or local legislation, regulations or other initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector or otherwise restrict fossil fuel production could result in increased costs of compliance for fossil fuel use, and thereby reduce demand for fossil fuels, which could reduce demand for Boardwalk Pipelines’ transportation and storage services. Political, litigation and financial risks may result in Boardwalk Pipelines’ fossil fuel producer customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes, or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for Boardwalk Pipelines’ services. Moreover, the increased competitiveness of alternative energy sources could reduce demand for hydrocarbons and for Boardwalk Pipelines’ services. Finally, Boardwalk Pipelines may also be subject to various physical risks from climate change. For more information on these physical risks, see Boardwalk Pipelines’ risk factor titled “Climatic conditions and events could adversely impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, pipelines and facilities, or those of its customers or suppliers” below. 

Climatic conditions and events could adversely impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, pipelines and facilities, or those of its customers or suppliers.

Climatic events can cause disruptions to, delays in or suspension of Boardwalk Pipelines’ services, by interrupting its operations, causing loss of or damage to equipment, or having similar impacts on its customers or third party suppliers. In general, Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations could be significantly impacted by climatic conditions such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and wintry conditions. Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipeline operations along coastal waters and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico could be adversely impacted by climatic conditions such as rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion, which could result in serious damage to Boardwalk Pipelines’ facilities and affect its ability to provide transportation services. Such damage could result in leakage, migration, releases or spills from Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations and could result in liability, remedial obligations or otherwise have a negative impact on operations. Such climactic conditions could also impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers’ ability to utilize Boardwalk Pipelines’ services and third party suppliers’ ability to provide Boardwalk Pipelines with the products and services necessary to maintain operation of its facilities. Boardwalk Pipelines may incur significant damages as well as costs to repair or maintain its facilities, which could adversely affect its operations and the financial health of its business. In recent years, local governments and landowners in Louisiana have filed lawsuits against energy companies, alleging that their operations contributed to increased coastal rising seas and erosion and seeking substantial damages. Changing meteorological conditions, particularly temperature, may affect the amount, timing, or location of demand for energy or the products Boardwalk Pipelines transports, which may impact demand for its services.

25
Legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more prescriptive compliance activities, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or withdrawal of regulatory waivers could subject Boardwalk Pipelines to increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA, which is part of the DOT. PHMSA regulates the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, and maintenance of existing interstate natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. PHMSA regulation currently requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including frequent inspections, remediation of certain identified anomalies and other measures to promote pipeline safety in HCAs, MCAs, Class 1 and 2 areas (depending on the potential impacts of a risk event), Class 3 and Class 4 areas, as well as in areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. States have jurisdiction over certain of Boardwalk Pipelines’ intrastate pipelines and have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations. State regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law that affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ intrastate operations. Compliance with these rules over time generally has resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. The imposition of new or more stringent pipeline safety rules applicable to natural gas or NGL pipelines, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance from PHMSA or any state agencies, could cause Boardwalk Pipelines to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in Boardwalk Pipelines incurring increased capital and operating costs, experiencing operational delays and suffering potential adverse impacts to its operations or ability to reliably serve its customers. Requirements that are imposed under the 2011 Act, the 2016 Act or the 2020 Act, or other pipeline safety legislation or implementing regulations, may also increase Boardwalk Pipelines’ capital and operating costs or impact the operation of its pipelines. 

Boardwalk Pipelines has entered into certain firm transportation contracts with shippers that utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, based upon the authority Boardwalk Pipelines received from PHMSA to operate those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipeline’s SMYS under issued permits with specific conditions. PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, it could affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets and it could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ actual construction and development costs could exceed its forecasts; its anticipated cash flow from construction and development projects will not be immediate; and its construction and development projects may not be completed on time or at all.

Boardwalk Pipelines has been and is currently engaged in several construction projects involving its existing assets and the construction of new facilities for which it has expended or will expend significant capital. Boardwalk Pipelines expects to continue to engage in the construction of additional growth projects and modifications of its system. When Boardwalk Pipelines builds a new pipeline or expands or modifies an existing facility, the design, construction and development occurs over an extended period of time, and it will not receive any revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed into commercial service. On Boardwalk Pipelines’ interstate pipelines there are several years between when the project is announced and when customers begin using the new facilities. During this period, Boardwalk Pipelines spends capital and incurs costs without receiving any of the financial benefits associated with the projects. The construction of new assets involves regulatory (federal, state and local), landowner opposition, environmental, activist, legal, political, materials and labor costs, as well as operational and other risks that are difficult to predict and some are beyond Boardwalk Pipelines’ control. A project may not be completed on time or at all due to a variety of factors, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of developments or circumstances that Boardwalk Pipelines is not aware of when it commits to the project. Any of these events could result in material unexpected costs or have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its growth projects.

Boardwalk Pipelines may face opposition to the operation of its pipelines and facilities or construction or expansion of facilities or new pipeline projects from various groups.

Boardwalk Pipelines may face opposition to the operation of its pipelines and facilities or construction or expansion of its facilities or new pipeline projects from governmental officials, environmental groups, landowners, communities, tribal or local groups and other advocates. Such opposition could take many forms, including organized protests, attempts to block or sabotage Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, acts of eco-terrorism, intervention in regulatory or administrative proceedings involving Boardwalk Pipelines’ assets, or lawsuits or other actions designed to prevent, disrupt or delay the operation of its assets and business. For example, repairing Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines often involves securing consent from individual landowners to access their property; one or more landowners may resist Boardwalk Pipelines’ efforts to make needed repairs, which could lead to an interruption in the operation of the affected pipeline or facility for a period of 

26
time that is significantly longer than would have otherwise been the case. Acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism could cause significant damage or injury to people, property or the environment and lead to extended interruptions of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations and material damages and costs.

The price differentials between natural gas supplies and market demand for natural gas may reduce the transportation rates that Boardwalk Pipelines can charge on certain portions of its pipeline systems.

Each year a portion of Boardwalk Pipelines firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be replaced or renewed. As a result of current market conditions, Boardwalk Pipelines may renew some expiring contracts at lower rates or for shorter terms than in the past. The transportation rates Boardwalk Pipelines is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available supply, geographical location of natural gas production, the competition between producing basins, competition with other pipelines for supply and markets, the demand for gas by end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market demand for the gas (basis differentials). Market conditions have resulted in a sustained narrowing of basis differentials on certain portions of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipeline system, which has reduced transportation rates that can be charged in the affected areas and adversely affected the contract terms Boardwalk Pipelines can secure from its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts being renewed or replaced. Boardwalk Pipelines expects these market conditions to continue.

Changes in energy prices, including natural gas, oil and NGLs, impact the supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ business.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers, especially producers and certain plant operators, are directly impacted by changes in commodity prices. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in both domestic and worldwide supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including for natural gas, the realization of potential LNG exports and demand growth within the power generation market. Volatility in the pricing levels of natural gas, oil and NGLs could adversely affect the businesses of certain of Boardwalk Pipelines’ producer customers and could result in defaults or the non-renewal of Boardwalk Pipelines’ contracted capacity when existing contracts expire. Commodity prices could affect the operations of certain of Boardwalk Pipelines’ industrial customers, including the temporary closure or reduction of plant operations, resulting in decreased deliveries to those customers. Future increases in the price of natural gas and NGLs could make alternative energy and feedstock sources more competitive and decrease demand for natural gas and NGLs. A reduced level of demand for natural gas and NGLs could diminish the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipelines’ systems and reduce the demand of its services.

Boardwalk Pipelines is exposed to credit risk relating to default or bankruptcy by its customers.

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the default by a customer of its contractual obligations or the customer filing bankruptcy. Boardwalk Pipelines has credit risk with both its existing customers and those supporting its growth projects. Credit risk exists in relation to Boardwalk Pipelines’ growth projects, both because expansion customers make long term firm capacity commitments to Boardwalk Pipelines for such projects and certain of those expansion customers agree to provide credit support as construction for such projects progresses. If a customer fails to post the required credit support or defaults during the growth project process, overall returns on the project may be reduced to the extent an adjustment to the scope of the project occurs or Boardwalk Pipelines is unable to replace the defaulting customer with a customer willing to pay similar rates. In 2020 and 2019, two expansion customers declared bankruptcy for which Boardwalk Pipelines was able to use the credit support obtained during the growth project process to cover a portion of the customer’s remaining long term commitment.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ credit exposure also includes receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by Boardwalk Pipelines to them under certain NNS and parking and lending (“PAL”) services.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ revolving credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that restrict its business and financing activities.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ revolving credit facility contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict its ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue business activities. Its credit agreement limits its ability to make loans or investments, make material changes to the nature of its business, merge, consolidate or engage in asset sales, or grant liens or make negative pledges. This agreement also requires it to maintain a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the agreement) of not more than 5.0 to 1.0, or up to 5.5 to 1.0 for the three quarters following a qualified acquisition or series of acquisitions, where the purchase price exceeds $100.0 million over a rolling 12-month period, which limits the amount of additional indebtedness Boardwalk Pipelines can incur to grow its business, 

27
and could require it to reduce indebtedness if its earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) decreases to a level that would cause it to breach this covenant. Future financing agreements Boardwalk Pipelines may enter into could contain similar or more restrictive covenants or may not be as favorable as those under its existing indebtedness.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its credit agreement may be affected by events beyond its control, including economic, financial and market conditions. If market, economic conditions or its financial performance deteriorate, its ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. If Boardwalk Pipelines is not able to incur additional indebtedness, it may be required to seek other sources of funding that may be on less favorable terms. If it defaults under its credit agreement or another financing agreement, significant additional restrictions may become applicable. In addition, a default could result in a significant portion of its indebtedness becoming immediately due and payable, and its lenders could terminate their commitment to make further loans to it. If such event occurs, Boardwalk Pipelines would not have, and may not be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.

As of December 31, 2021, Boardwalk Pipelines had $3.4 billion in principal amount of long-term debt outstanding. This level of debt requires significant interest payments. Boardwalk Pipelines’ inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Boardwalk Pipelines’ indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•limit Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general business activities;

•impact the ratings received from credit rating agencies;

•increase Boardwalk Pipelines’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•limit Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.

Boardwalk Pipelines is permitted, under its revolving credit facility and the indentures governing its notes, to incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations under its revolving credit facility and the indentures governing the notes. If Boardwalk Pipelines incurs additional debt, its increased leverage could also result in the consequences described above.

Limited access to the debt markets and increases in interest rates could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ business.

Boardwalk Pipelines anticipates funding its capital and other spending requirements through its available financing options, including cash generated from operations, borrowings under its revolving credit facility and issuances of additional debt. Changes in the debt markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and an increase in interest rates, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. This may affect its ability to raise needed funding and reduce the amount of cash available to fund its operations or growth projects or refinance maturing debt. If the debt markets were not available, it is not certain if other adequate financing options would be available to Boardwalk Pipelines on terms and conditions that it would find acceptable.

Any disruption in the debt markets could require Boardwalk Pipelines to take additional measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until it can arrange alternative credit arrangements or other funding for its business needs. Such measures could include reducing or delaying business activities, reducing its operations to lower expenses and reducing other discretionary uses of cash. Boardwalk Pipelines may be unable to execute its growth strategy or take advantage of certain business opportunities.

The outbreak of COVID-19 and the measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 could materially adversely affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ business, financial condition and results of operations and those of its customers, suppliers and other business partners.

The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 significantly impacted the world and the U.S., and impacted global demand for oil and petrochemical products. COVID-19 has also resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including business closures, supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces. Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations are considered essential critical infrastructure under current Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency guidelines; 

28
however, if significant portions of Boardwalk Pipelines’ workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness or quarantines, its business could be materially adversely affected. Boardwalk Pipelines may also be unable to perform fully on its contracts, and its costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable. It is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could also further cause disruption in Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers’ business; cause delay, or limit the ability of its customers to perform, including in making timely payments to it. The impact of COVID-19 has impacted capital markets, which may impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers’ financial position. The COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of increasing several of the other risk factors contained herein.

Boardwalk Pipelines does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to its operations.

Substantial portions of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines, storage and other facilities are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents, and Boardwalk Pipelines is subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use rights if it does not have valid land use rights or if such land use rights lapse or terminate. Some of the rights to construct and operate Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines storage or other facilities on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies that it obtains are for specific periods of time. Boardwalk Pipelines cannot guarantee that it will always be able to renew, when necessary, existing land use rights or obtain new land use rights without experiencing significant costs or experiencing landowner opposition. Any loss of these land use rights with respect to the operation of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines, storage and other facilities, through its inability to acquire or renew right-of-way or easement contracts or permits, licenses, consents or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on its operations.

Boardwalk Pipelines may not be successful in executing its strategy to grow and diversify its business.

Boardwalk Pipelines relies primarily on the revenues generated from its natural gas transportation and storage services. Negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on Boardwalk Pipelines’ financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets. Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to grow, diversify and increase cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to expand its existing business lines and to close and execute on accretive acquisitions. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable. 

Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to replace expiring gas storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all are subject to market conditions.

Boardwalk Pipelines owns and operates substantial natural gas storage facilities. The market for the storage and PAL services that it offers is impacted by the factors and market conditions discussed above for Boardwalk Pipelines’ transportation services, and is also impacted by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. When market conditions cause a narrowing of time period price spreads and a decline in the price volatility of natural gas, these factors adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge for its storage and PAL services.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which it may not be adequately insured.

There are a variety of operating risks inherent in transporting and storing natural gas, ethylene and NGLs, such as leaks and other forms of releases, explosions, fires, cyber-attacks and mechanical problems, which could have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the nature and location of Boardwalk Pipelines’ business may make it susceptible to catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named storms, particularly with regard to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and other severe weather. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of its operations and substantial financial losses. The location of pipelines in HCAs, which includes populated areas, residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks.

Boardwalk Pipelines currently possesses property, business interruption, cyber threat and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Boardwalk Pipelines does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain events, hazards or potential losses.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Loews Hotels & Co

The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have had, and are expected to continue to have, material adverse impacts on Loews Hotels & Co’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

In response to the spread of COVID-19, governments across the globe have implemented measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, such as through city, regional or national lockdowns or stay-at-home orders, narrowly defined and widespread business closures, restrictions on travel, limitations on large group gatherings and quarantines, among others. Some of these measures, such as international travel restrictions in particular, continue in order to contain further spread. Beyond the existence of governmental restrictions, the perception of health risks associated with COVID-19 has limited, and continues to limit, business and leisure travel. The spread of the coronavirus, including its resurgence through new variants, and the continuing related containment efforts have had, and continue to have, macro-economic implications, the effects of which could be felt well beyond the time the spread of the virus is mitigated or contained. These developments have caused unprecedented disruptions to the global economy, including supply chains, air travel and normal business operations across sectors, including the hospitality industry that depends on active levels of business and leisure travel.

In response to the pandemic, Loews Hotels & Co temporarily suspended operations at the majority of its owned and/or operated hotels. While all of these hotels have resumed general operations, occupancy rates remain considerably lower, particularly for certain hotels that rely on business travel, when compared to occupancy rates prior to March of 2020. As such, revenues have been lower and may be insufficient to offset certain fixed costs, such as insurance and property taxes. The potential for the resuspension of operations varies by hotel property and will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside Loews Hotels & Co’s control, including the transmissivity and virulence of future virus variants, the velocity of future virus spread and quarantine periods for individuals exposed or infected required or recommended by governmental authorities or medical professionals. In addition, as a result of the pandemic, Loews Hotels & Co has had to implement a number of new measures for the health and safety of its guests and employees. These new measures, which may need to remain in place for the foreseeable future, have resulted and will continue to result in increased costs.

Given that Loews Hotels & Co owns and leases, relative to some of its competitors, a higher proportion of its hotel properties, compared to the number of properties that it manages for third-party owners, it may as a result of COVID-19 and mitigation measures face increased risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, cash trap periods, the inability to draw further loan disbursements and reduced availability of replacement financing at reasonable terms or at all; difficulty reducing costs; declines in real estate values and potential additional impairments in the value of Loews Hotels & Co’s assets; and a limited ability to respond to market conditions. In addition, uncertain or fluctuating real estate valuations and the inability for third-party purchasers to obtain capital may prevent Loews Hotels & Co from selling properties on acceptable terms.

The full extent and duration of the impacts caused by the COVID-19 outbreak on Loews Hotels & Co’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows remains largely uncertain and dependent on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity, duration, transmission rate and geographic spread of current and future variants of COVID-19 worldwide, including in the United States and Canada, the extent and effectiveness, whether perceived or actual, of the containment and mitigation measures taken, the cost to implement containment and mitigation measures, the impact of containment and mitigation measures on operations and Loews Hotels & Co’s workforce, the timing, efficacy and ability of vaccinations and other treatments to combat COVID-19, and the response of the overall economy, the travel and leisure sector, financial markets, governmental authorities and the population, particularly in areas where Loews Hotels & Co operates. Accordingly, COVID-19 presents continuing material uncertainty and risk with respect to Loews Hotels & Co’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.

Even following containment and mitigation of COVID-19, continuing uncertainty exists around when and if Loews Hotels & Co will be able to resume normal, pre-COVID-19 level operations for business or leisure travel. Once the COVID-19 outbreak is mitigated or contained, whenever that may be, historical travel patterns, both domestic and international, may continue to be disrupted either on a temporary basis or with longer term effects. For example, certain travel is dependent on commercial airlines restoring capacity, and their inability to restore full capacity or avoid the necessity to curtail operations in the future on a temporary or more permanent basis, could impact demand for Loews Hotels & Co’s services. Additionally, businesses that continue to rely on remote working and videoconferences may reduce the level of business travel both to save costs and to reduce the risk of exposure for their employees, and they may also seek alternatives to large public gatherings such as conferences and conventions. Leisure travelers may also be less inclined to travel or gather in large groups out of ongoing safety concerns, regardless of the lifting of mandated or recommended restrictions. In addition, with the potential adverse impact on jobs and the economy more broadly, leisure travel may be further impacted due to economic reasons. Further, the demand for lodging, and consumer confidence in travel generally, may not recover as quickly as other industries. Any of these trends could have continuing material adverse effects on Loews Hotels & Co’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

30
As part of cost containment efforts at the outset of the pandemic, Loews Hotels & Co put a substantial number of its employees on unpaid leaves of absence or severed them from the organization. Now that conditions have warranted the resumption of operations that necessitate increased staffing levels, finding and attracting sufficient talent to fill the roles that have been furloughed or eliminated has been challenging in certain markets in which Loews Hotels & Co operates. Additionally, many of Loews Hotels & Co’s service providers and suppliers also put their employees on leaves of absence or severed employees. Should they be unable to find and attract sufficient talent to fill the roles that they have furloughed or eliminated, Loews Hotels & Co may not have the requisite services or supplies available to resume operations at the time or in the manner of its choosing.

Loews Hotels & Co continues to evaluate spending and manage operating expenses as variants of COVID-19 impact different markets in which it operates. Loews Hotels & Co has received and may receive additional demands or requests from labor unions that represent its employees, whether in the course of its periodic renegotiation of collective bargaining agreements or otherwise, for additional compensation, healthcare benefits, operational protocols or other terms that could increase costs, and could experience labor disputes or disruptions as it continues to implement mitigation plans. Some actions Loews Hotels & Co has taken, or may take in the future, to reduce costs for it or its third-party owners may negatively impact guest loyalty, owner preference, and its ability to attract and retain employees, and its reputation and market share may suffer as a result. Further, the recovery period could be extensive and certain operational changes, particularly with respect to enhanced health and safety measures, may continue to be necessary and could increase ongoing costs.

Loews Hotels & Co’s construction projects could be delayed as a result of COVID-19 and related containment efforts, including containment efforts applicable to or affecting contractors, suppliers and inspectors required to review projects.

As a manager of hotels owned by joint ventures that Loews Hotels & Co invests in and by third parties, Loews Hotels & Co earns fees based on the revenues that those managed hotels generate. As a result of reduced revenues described above due to COVID-19 and mitigating measures, Loews Hotels & Co’s fee-based revenues are also materially reduced. Certain of these properties also have contracts that require payments by Loews Hotels & Co to preserve its management of the hotel if the hotel’s operating results do not achieve certain performance levels. These payments may be uneconomical for Loews Hotels & Co and lead to Loews Hotels & Co no longer managing one or more of those properties.

In properties in which Loews Hotels & Co has an ownership interest, Loews Hotels & Co leases space to third-party tenants and earns both fixed and variable amounts of rent, depending on each underlying lease arrangement. Some of these tenants informed Loews Hotels & Co that their operations have been adversely impacted by COVID-19 business restrictions causing rent abatement periods in certain circumstances. In addition, variable rent, which is generally tied to the tenant’s sales, has been, and will continue to be, materially adversely affected by the effects of the pandemic.

Loews Hotels & Co’s business may be materially adversely affected by various operating risks common to the hospitality industry, including competition, excess supply and dependence on business travel and tourism.

Loews Hotels & Co owns and operates hotels that have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets. A typical office property, for example, has long-term leases with third-party tenants, which provide a relatively stable long-term stream of revenue. Hotels, on the other hand, generate revenue from guests that typically stay at the hotel for only a few nights, which causes the room rate and occupancy levels at each hotel to change nearly every day, and results in earnings that can be highly volatile.

In addition, Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are subject to various operating risks common to the hospitality industry, many of which are beyond Loews Hotels & Co’s control, including:

•changes in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy and financial markets, as well as more localized changes in the economy of each hotel’s geographic location;

•disruptions or delays in our supply chain for goods and materials, including those used for hotel development, renovations and operations;

•labor supply disruptions or shortages;

•war, political conditions or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;

31
•outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as the recent coronavirus;

•federal, state or local government-mandated travel restrictions and/or shut-down orders of hotels or other drivers that reduce demand for hotel businesses;

•natural or man-made disasters or other catastrophes;

•material reductions or prolonged interruptions of public utilities and services;

•decreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business due to self-imposed and/or government-mandated travel restrictions, adverse economic conditions or otherwise;

•decreased need for business-related travel due to innovations in business-related technology;

•the financial condition and general operational condition of the airline, automotive and other transportation-related industries and its impact on travel;

•decreased airline capacities and routes and disruption in airline operations;

•competition from other hotels and alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb, in the markets in which Loews Hotels & Co operates;

•requirements for periodic capital reinvestment to maintain and upgrade hotels;

•increases in operating costs, including labor (such as from minimum wage increases or labor shortages), workers’ compensation, benefits, insurance, food and beverage, commodity costs, energy and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events, due to inflation, new or different federal, state or local governmental regulations, including tariffs, constrained supply, and other factors that may not be offset by increased revenues;

•the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations;

•organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for Loews Hotels & Co’s properties generally as a result of certain labor tactics;

•changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers, including with respect to the underlying attractions supporting Loews Hotels & Co’s immersive destination properties, such as the Universal theme parks for its Orlando, Florida properties, and stadiums, arenas and convention centers for properties in other markets;

•geographic concentration of operations and customers;

•shortages of desirable locations for development; and

•relationships with third-party property owners, developers, landlords and joint venture partners, including the risk that third-party property owners, developers, landlords and/or partners may encounter financial difficulties, may not fulfill material obligations and/or may terminate lease, management, joint venture or other agreements.

In addition to materially affecting the business of Loews Hotels & Co generally, these factors, and the reputational repercussions of these factors, could materially adversely affect, and from time to time have materially adversely affected, individual hotels and hotels in particular regions.

Loews Hotels & Co is exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase its costs, reduce its profits, limit its ability to respond to market conditions or restrict its growth strategy.

Loews Hotels & Co’s proportion of owned and leased properties, compared to the number of properties that it manages for third-party owners, is larger than that of some of its competitors. Real estate ownership and leasing is subject to risks not applicable to managed or franchised properties, including:

•real estate, insurance, zoning, tax, environmental and eminent domain laws;

32
•the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;

•risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels and the availability of replacement financing;

•risks associated with the possibility that cost increases will outpace revenue increases and that, in the event of an economic slowdown, a high proportion of fixed costs will make it difficult to reduce costs to the extent required to offset declining revenues;

•risks associated with real estate and property leases, including the possibility of rent increases and the inability to renew or extend upon favorable terms;

•risks associated with real estate condominiums, including the possibility of special assessments by condominiums that Loews Hotels & Co does not control;

•fluctuations in real estate values and potential impairments in the value of Loews Hotels & Co’s assets; and

•the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.

The hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility.

The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which Loews Hotels & Co’s properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the consumer base served. Historically, Loews Hotels & Co generally has experienced revenues and earnings that are lower in the third quarter of each year than in each of the other quarters. In addition, the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis. The seasonality and cyclicality of its industry may contribute to fluctuation in Loews Hotels & Co’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

Loews Hotels & Co operates in a highly competitive industry, both for customers and for acquisitions and developments of new properties.

The hospitality industry is highly competitive. Loews Hotels & Co’s properties compete with other hotels and alternative accommodations based on a number of factors, including room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Some of its competitors also have greater financial and marketing resources than Loews Hotels & Co. In addition, travelers can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms.

Loews Hotels & Co also competes for hotel acquisitions and development projects with entities that have similar investment objectives as it does. This competition could limit the number of suitable investment opportunities. It may also increase the bargaining power of Loews Hotels & Co’s counterparties, making it more difficult for Loews Hotels & Co to acquire or develop new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in its business plans.

Any deterioration in the quality or reputation of Loews Hotels & Co’s brands could have a material adverse effect on its reputation and business.

Loews Hotels & Co’s brands and reputation are among its most important assets. Its ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of its brands and their associated reputation. If its brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality, or its brands or reputation are otherwise harmed, Loews Hotels & Co may be unable to attract guests to its properties, and may further be unable to attract or retain joint venture partners or hotel owners. Loews Hotels & Co’s reputation may also suffer as a result of negative publicity regarding its hotels, including as a result of social media reports, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity. The continued expansion of media and social media formats has compounded the potential breadth and scope of negative publicity and has made it more difficult to control and effectively manage negative publicity.

Loews Hotels & Co’s efforts to develop new properties and renovate existing properties could be delayed or become more expensive.

Loews Hotels & Co from time to time renovates its properties and is currently expanding its portfolio through the ground-up construction of new properties in Coral Gables, Florida, and Arlington, Texas, along with a support facility in 

33
Apopka, Florida, and in the future may similarly develop additional new properties. Often these projects are undertaken with joint venture partners who may also serve as developer. These renovation and construction efforts are subject to a number of risks, including:

•construction delays, changes to plans and specifications and cost overruns (including labor and materials or unforeseeable site conditions) that may increase project costs; cause new development projects to not be completed by lender or municipal imposed required completion dates or subject Loews Hotels & Co to cancellation penalties for reservations accepted;

•obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;

•changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns;

•governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;

•projects financed with construction debt are subject to interest rate risk as uncertain timing and amount of draws make effective hedging difficult to obtain;

•weather delays and force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes, floods and other natural or man made catastrophes; and

•design defects that could increase costs.

Additionally, renovating existing properties and developing new properties typically involve lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of capital must be funded before the properties begin to operate and generate revenue. If the cost of renovations or new development exceeds budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for development is longer than initially anticipated, Loews Hotels & Co’s operating results could be reduced. Loews Hotels & Co has seen construction timelines lengthen due to various factors, including competition for skilled construction labor, challenges related to financing, disruption in the supply chain for materials, and the impact of COVID-19 generally, and these circumstances could continue or worsen in the future. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that all development pipeline projects will result in new hotels entering Loews Hotel & Co’s system, or that those hotels will open when anticipated. Further, due to the lengthy development cycle, intervening adverse economic conditions in general and as they apply to Loews Hotels & Co and its development partners may alter or impede the development plans, thereby resulting in incremental costs or potential impairment charges. In addition, using multiple sources of capital to develop new properties reduces or eliminates the ability of Loews Hotels & Co to cease commenced projects if the overall economic environment conditions change. Moreover, during the early stages of operations, charges related to interest expense and depreciation may substantially detract from, or even outweigh, the profitability of certain new property investments.

Co-investing in hotel properties decreases Loews Hotels & Co’s ability to manage risk.

Loews Hotels & Co has from time to time invested, and expects to continue to invest, in hotel properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with Loews Hotels & Co’s business interests or goals. Further, Loews Hotels & Co may be unable to take action without the approval of its co-investors, or its co-investors could take actions binding on the property without the consent of Loews Hotels & Co. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, Loews Hotels & Co could become liable for its share of liabilities.

Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are geographically concentrated, which exposes its business to the effects of regional events and occurrences.

Loews Hotels & Co has a concentration of hotels in Florida. Specifically, as of December 31, 2021, eight hotels, representing 55% of rooms in its system, were located at Universal Orlando in Orlando, Florida and nine hotels, representing approximately 60% of rooms in its system, were located in Florida. The concentration of hotels in one region or a limited number of markets may expose Loews Hotels & Co to risks of adverse economic and other developments that are greater than if its portfolio were more geographically diverse. These developments include regional economic downturns, a decline in the popularity of or access to area tourist attractions, such as theme parks, significant increases in the number of Loews Hotels & Co’s competitors’ hotels in these markets and potentially higher local property, sales and income taxes, property insurance costs or other expenses in the geographic markets in which it is concentrated. In addition, 

34
Loews Hotels & Co’s properties in Florida are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as hurricanes, strong winds and flooding, which have in the past caused damage to its hotels in Florida, and which may in the future be intensified as a result of climate change, as well as outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases. Loews Hotels & Co’s business may be significantly affected by other risks common to the Florida tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt or reduce air travel to and from Florida for any reason can adversely affect its business.

The growth and use of alternative reservation channels adversely affects Loews Hotels & Co’s business.

A significant percentage of hotel rooms for guests at Loews Hotels & Co’s properties is booked through internet travel and other intermediaries. In most cases, Loews Hotels & Co has agreements with such intermediaries and pays them commissions and/or fees for sales of its rooms through their systems. If such bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or fees, reduced room rates or other significant concessions from Loews Hotels & Co. There can be no assurance that Loews Hotels & Co will be able to negotiate such agreements in the future with terms as favorable as those that exist today. Moreover, these intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites and other outlets. As a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to Loews Hotels & Co’s brands.

Loews Hotels & Co’s insurance coverage may not cover all possible losses, and it may not be able to renew its insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all.

Although Loews Hotels & Co maintains various property, casualty and other insurance policies, proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Additionally, insurance policies that it maintains may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Loews Hotels & Co maintains may contain large deductibles or may not cover all risks to which its properties are potentially subject.

Labor shortages could restrict Loews Hotels & Co’s ability to operate its properties or grow its business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce its results of operations.

Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by thousands of employees. If it is unable to attract, retain, train and engage a sufficient number of skilled employees, its ability to manage and staff its properties adequately could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. Staffing shortages could also hinder its ability to grow and expand its business. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at its properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase its labor costs or temporarily ceasing to offer certain services, which could harm Loews Hotel & Co’s reputation or guest satisfaction.

A portion of Loews Hotels & Co’s labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect Loews Hotels & Co’s business and results of operations. A prolonged dispute with covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or otherwise could have an adverse impact on Loews Hotels & Co’s operations. Adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm its reputation and reduce customer demand for its services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could have an adverse impact on its results of operations. To the extent that Loews Hotels & Co’s non-union employees join unions, Loews Hotels & Co would have greater exposure to risks associated with such labor problems. Furthermore, Loews Hotels & Co may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or “critical” status and a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such events or additional costs may have materially adverse effects.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Altium Packaging

The COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse impact on Altium Packaging.

Altium Packaging manufactures packaging that is used with products in critical sectors, such as the pharmaceutical, household and industrial cleaning and food and beverage markets, and is thus an essential business as contemplated by state and local orders. It therefore has operated, and continues to operate, all of its manufacturing facilities to support those sectors. If widespread infections were to affect any of its facilities or workers, including those supporting critical sectors, it may be required to temporarily shut down or otherwise modify the working conditions at such facilities to address the 

35
infections. Any such changes could cause Altium Packaging to be unable to meet demand from its customers if it cannot provide support from other facilities in its network.

In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic’s wide-reaching impact on the global economy has disrupted global supply chains, including those that supply Altium Packaging with raw materials and other inputs necessary for it to manufacture its packaging products. Further, the pandemic has led to labor market dislocations that have led to employee-retention issues and an increase in the cost of labor at Altium Packaging’s manufacturing facilities. If these supply chain and/or labor market disruptions continue, Altium Packaging’s business may be materially adversely affected. 

Altium Packaging’s substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.

Altium Packaging has a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Its inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Altium Packaging’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:

•limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;

•increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and

•limit its ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.

In addition, the credit agreements governing its current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which impose operating and financial restrictions on it. As a result of these covenants, Altium Packaging could be limited in the manner in which it conducts its business and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on Altium Packaging.

Altium Packaging is exposed to changes in consumer preferences.

Sales of Altium Packaging’s plastic containers depend heavily on the volume of sales made by its customers to consumers. Consequently, changes in consumer preferences for products in the industries that it serves or the packaging formats in which such products are delivered, whether as a result of changes in cost, convenience or health, environmental and social concerns or perceptions regarding plastics, may result in a decline in the demand for Altium Packaging’s plastic container products.

Fluctuations in raw material prices and raw material availability may materially affect Altium Packaging’s results of operations.

To produce its products, Altium Packaging uses large quantities of plastic resins and recycled plastic materials. It faces the risk that its access to these raw materials may be interrupted or that it may not be able to purchase these raw materials at prices that are acceptable to it. In general, Altium Packaging does not have long-term supply contracts with its suppliers, and its purchases of raw materials are subject to market price volatility. Although Altium Packaging generally is able to pass changes in the prices of raw materials through to its customers over a period of time, it may not always be able to do so or there may be a lag between when its costs increase and when it passes those costs through to its customers. It may not be able to pass through all future raw material price increases in a timely manner or at all due to competitive pressures. In addition, a sustained increase in resin and recycled plastic prices, relative to alternative packaging materials, would make plastic containers less economical for its customers and could result in reductions in the use of plastic containers. Any limitation on its ability to procure its primary raw materials or to pass through price increases in such materials on a timely basis could materially negatively affect Altium Packaging.

Altium Packaging’s customers may increase their self-manufacturing.

Increased self-manufacturing by Altium Packaging’s customers may have a material adverse impact on its sales volume and financial results. Altium Packaging believes that its customers may engage in self-manufacturing over time at locations where transportation costs are high, and where low complexity and available space to install blow molding equipment exist.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally

In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face additional risks and uncertainties described below.

The COVID-19 pandemic is having widespread impacts on the way we and our subsidiaries operate.

The spread of COVID-19 and mitigating measures has had, and continues to have, macroeconomic implications, the effects of which could be felt well beyond the time during which the spread of the virus is mitigated or contained. These developments have caused unprecedented disruptions to the global economy and normal business operations across sectors and countries, including the sectors and countries in which we and our subsidiaries operate. Because of the size and breadth of the pandemic, all of the direct and indirect consequences of COVID-19 are not yet known and may not emerge for some time.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, large portions of our and our subsidiaries’ employees continue to work remotely on at least a part time basis, which, among other things, may disrupt their productivity. Similar workplace restrictions are in place at many of our and our subsidiaries’ critical vendors, which may result in interruptions in service delivery or failure by vendors to properly perform required services. In addition, having shifted to remote working arrangements and being more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities, we and our subsidiaries also face a heightened risk of cybersecurity attacks or data security incidents. We and our subsidiaries also self-insure our health benefits and therefore may experience increased medical claims as a result of the pandemic.

Failures or interruptions in or breaches to our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems or information technology or communication infrastructure or those of our third party vendors could materially and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ operations.

We and our subsidiaries are dependent upon information technologies, computer and communication systems and networks, including those maintained by us and our subsidiaries and those maintained and provided to us and our subsidiaries by third parties (for example, “software-as-a-service” and cloud solutions), to conduct operations and are reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our and their businesses. We and our subsidiaries are dependent upon operational and financial computer and communication systems and information technology infrastructure to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our and their businesses. Any failure of our or our subsidiaries’ systems or information technology infrastructure, or those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer, telecommunications and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes, including cyber attacks or other cyber incidents, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires, utility outages, theft, design defects, human error or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. Cyber attacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more difficult to prevent, detect and remediate, and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, and that may have the backing of foreign governmental actors. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets may be specific targets of cyber attacks, which can have catastrophic consequences, and hotel chains, among other consumer-facing businesses, have been subject to various cyber attacks targeting payment card and other sensitive consumer information. Cyber attacks and cyber incidents take many forms, including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement, theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. CNA was recently subjected to a sophisticated cybersecurity incident involving ransomware. In addition, one of CNA’s vendors also recently experienced a cybersecurity incident. For additional information about these incidents see “Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA Financial Corporation” above under this Part II, Item 1A. 

As with other large companies, we and our subsidiaries and our and their third party vendors have experienced cyber attacks and other cyber incidents and expect this to continue. If we and our subsidiaries and our and their third party vendors do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue to build and maintain our and their information technology security infrastructure, or if we or our subsidiaries or our or our subsidiaries’ vendors fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyber attacks or other cyber incidents, then this may disrupt our and our subsidiaries’ operations, cause significant damage to our or their assets and surrounding areas, cause loss of life or serious bodily injury, impact our or their data framework or cause a failure to protect personal information of customers, employees or others.

The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could impact our and our subsidiaries’ ability to timely perform critical business functions, resulting in disruption or deterioration in our and our subsidiaries’ operations and business and expose us and our subsidiaries to significant financial losses and monetary and reputational damages. In addition, potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required 

37
computer system upgrades and security related investments. The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

From time to time we and our subsidiaries may be subject to litigation, for which we and they may be unable to accurately assess the level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a significant adverse effect on our or their financial condition or results of operations.

We and our subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings and disputes. These matters may include, among others, contract disputes, claims disputes, reinsurance disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, intellectual property disputes, disputes related to employment and tax matters and other litigation incidental to our or their businesses. For instance, we and certain of our Boardwalk Pipelines-related subsidiaries are defendants in a class action litigation in the State of Delaware related to our 2018 acquisition of the Boardwalk Pipelines limited partnership units not already owned by our affiliates. For additional information regarding this matter, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Litigation is inherently subject to great uncertainty and it is difficult to predict the outcome or effect of any litigation matters. The outcome of any pending or future litigation could have a significant adverse impact on our or our subsidiaries’ financial condition or results of operations.

Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.

Terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in the United States or abroad, the continuation or escalation of armed hostilities or the outbreak of additional hostilities, including military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on us and the assets and businesses of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from an act of terrorism. Terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism could also result in increased political, economic and financial market instability, a decline in energy consumption and volatility in the price of oil and gas, which could affect the market for Boardwalk Pipelines’ transportation and storage services. In addition, terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels & Co. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.

Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state, local, foreign and international environmental laws, including those relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal, removal or clean up of hazardous wastes and other activities relating to the protection of the environment. Many of such laws have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Boardwalk Pipelines is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of various substances, including hazardous substances and waste in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. In addition, Altium Packaging may be adversely affected by laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, plastic products. Further, existing environmental laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof may be amended and new laws may be adopted in the future.

Loss of key vendor relationships or issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries’ operations.

We and our subsidiaries rely on products, equipment and services provided by many third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers in the United States and abroad, which exposes us and them to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services (including, in the case of CNA, claims administrators performing significant claims administration and adjudication functions). Certain products, equipment and services may be available from a limited number of sources. If one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products, equipment or services at the requisite level for any reason, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers, hotel guests or others, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business, operations and reputation.

38
We could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries and our equity method investments.

Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of pipeline and storage assets at Boardwalk Pipelines, our equity method investment in Altium Packaging and hotel investments owned by Loews Hotels & Co.

We also test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Asset impairment evaluations by us and our subsidiaries with respect to both long-lived assets and goodwill are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.

We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.

We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.

We and our subsidiaries face competition for senior executives and qualified specialized talent.

We and our subsidiaries depend on the services of our key personnel, who possess skills critical to the operation of our and their businesses. Our and our subsidiaries’ executive management teams are highly experienced and possess extensive skills in their relevant industries. The ability to retain senior executives and to attract and retain highly skilled professionals and personnel with specialized industry and technical experience is important to our and our subsidiaries’ success and future growth. Competition for this talent can be intense, and we and our subsidiaries may not be successful in our efforts. The unexpected loss of the services of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us and our subsidiaries and could hinder our and their ability to effectively compete in the various industries in which we and they operate.

Increasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to ESG practices may impose additional costs on us and our subsidiaries or expose us and our subsidiaries to new or additional risks.

Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from stakeholders related to their ESG practices. Certain influential investors in recent years have been focused on ESG practices and have placed increasing importance on the implications and social cost of their investments. In addition, organizations that provide information on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, and many of these ratings processes are inconsistent with each other. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Regardless of the industry, investors’ increased focus and activism related to ESG and similar matters may hinder access to, or increase the cost of, capital, as investors may decide to reallocate capital or to not commit capital as a result of their assessment of a company’s ESG practices. In addition, other stakeholders, including customers, employees, suppliers, regulators and ratings agencies, have also been focused on ESG matters. 

Companies have also increasingly been requested by stakeholders to create and publish disclosures regarding their ESG practices. While we and our subsidiaries may make such disclosures from time to time, many of the statements in those disclosures may not be material and may be based on expectations and assumptions that may not be representative of actual risks or events or forecasts of expected risks or events. Such expectations and assumptions are necessarily uncertain and may be prone to error or subject to misinterpretation given the long timelines involved and the lack of an established single approach to identifying, measuring and reporting on many ESG matters.

As a holding company, our stakeholders generally focus on the ESG practices across our enterprise, including those at our subsidiaries. As our subsidiaries operate in different industries, the particular ESG issues that stakeholders tend to focus on differ from subsidiary to subsidiary. For instance, as a property and casualty insurer, CNA’s stakeholders may focus on the ESG practices of companies in which CNA invests, while Boardwalk Pipelines’ stakeholders may focus on climate change and emissions from Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations and Loews Hotels & Co’s stakeholders may focus on the carbon footprint of its properties.

Companies that do not adapt to or comply with investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which are evolving, or that are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern regarding ESG issues, regardless of whether there is a legal requirement to do so, may suffer from reputational damage and other adverse consequences. Additionally, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, we may not be able to compete as effectively to recruit or retain employees, which may adversely affect our operations.
