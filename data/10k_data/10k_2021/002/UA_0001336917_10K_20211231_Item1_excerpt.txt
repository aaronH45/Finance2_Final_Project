ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General 

Our principal business activities are developing, marketing and distributing branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. Our performance products are engineered in many designs and styles for use in nearly every climate and are worn worldwide by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on various playing fields around the globe and by consumers with active lifestyles.

We generate net revenues from the sale of our products globally to national, regional, independent and specialty wholesalers and distributors. We also generate net revenue from the sale of our products through our direct-to-consumer sales channel, which includes our owned Brand and Factory House stores and e-commerce websites. We plan to continue to grow our business over the long-term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories; expansion of our wholesale distribution; growth in our direct-to-consumer sales channel; and expansion in international markets. We believe that our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles globally; thus international expansion is a meaningful part of our long-term growth strategy. Additionally, our digital strategy is focused on supporting these long-term objectives, emphasizing connection and engagement with our consumers through multiple digital touchpoints. 

We were incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1996. We have registered trademarks around the globe, including UNDER ARMOUR®, HEATGEAR®, COLDGEAR®, HOVR™ and the Under Armour UA Logo 

, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. This Annual Report on Form 10-K also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our Company and our subsidiaries. All trademarks and trade names appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective holders.

Products

Our product offerings consist of apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. We market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with products that we believe are superior to non-performance-oriented athletic products. In Fiscal 2021, sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 

2
68%, 22% and 8% of net revenues, respectively. Licensing arrangements represented the remaining 2% of net revenues. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net revenues by product.

Apparel

Our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits to enhance comfort and mobility, support active movement, regulate body temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. Our apparel is engineered to replace non-performance fabrics in athletics and fitness applications with innovation and technologies designed and merchandised with various techniques and styles. Our apparel comes in three primary fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed fit). Our highly specialized products are sold in the sporting goods, outdoor and active use markets. Our mission is to make athletes better, and we aim to innovate our technical apparel products to provide performance benefits, such as creating breathable warmth, helping the body stay cool and dry in hotter-than-normal conditions; harnessing the body's energy to help fight fatigue; adapting to each athlete's unique body shape to improve fit and comfort and prevent slippage; and providing protection against rain while maintaining breathability.

These types of innovations and technologies, embedded in many of our apparel products, include: COLDGEAR® Reactor, HEATGEAR®, UA-ISO-Chill®, UA RUSH™, UA SMARTFORM™ and UA STORM™.

Footwear

Footwear includes products for running, training, basketball, cleated sports, recovery and outdoor applications. Our footwear is built with the mindset of making athletes better through differentiated and industry leading cushioning technologies such as Charged Cushioning®, UA Flow™, HOVR™ and UA Micro G®. These cushioning platforms provide athletes with improved ground feel, enhanced responsiveness and lightweight solutions. We also incorporate advanced materials and innovative consumer-centric constructions to enhance performance.

Accessories

Accessories primarily includes the sale of athletic performance gloves, bags, headwear and sports masks. Some of our accessories include the technologies mentioned above and are designed with advanced fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products.

License

We have agreements with licensees to develop certain Under Armour apparel, accessories and equipment. To maintain consistent brand quality, performance and compliance standards, our product, marketing, sales and quality assurance teams are involved in all steps of the design and go-to-market process. During Fiscal 2021, our licensees offered collegiate apparel and accessories, baby and youth apparel, team uniforms, socks, water bottles, eyewear and other specific hard goods equipment that feature performance advantages and functionality like our other product offerings.

Marketing and Promotion

We currently focus on marketing our products to consumers primarily for use in athletics, fitness, and training activities, emphasizing on connecting with our target consumer - athletes". We seek to drive consumer demand by building brand awareness that our products deliver advantages to help athletes perform better.

Sports Marketing

Our marketing and promotion strategy begins with providing and selling our products to high-performing athletes and teams at the high school, collegiate and professional levels. We execute this strategy through outfitting agreements, professional, club and collegiate sponsorship, individual athlete and influencer agreements and by providing and selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes. We also seek to sponsor and host consumer events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level by hosting combines, camps and clinics for young athletes in a variety of sports. As a result, our products are seen on the field and the court, and by various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live sporting events. This exposure helps us establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes. 

We are the official outfitter of athletic teams in several high-profile collegiate conferences and professional sport organizations, supporting the athletes on and off the field. We sponsor and sell our products to international sports teams, which helps drive brand awareness in various countries and regions worldwide. Further, we leverage our relationships with athletes, teams, leagues and youth experiences in our global and regional marketing and promotions.

3
Media

We feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media outlets. We also utilize social media to engage consumers and promote connectivity with our brand and products while engaging with our consumers throughout their performance journey. 

Retail Presentation

The primary goal of our retail marketing strategy is to increase brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. The design and funding of Under Armour point of sale displays and concept shops within our major retail accounts have been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. Under Armour point of sale displays and concept shops enhance our brand’s presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images.

Sales and Distribution

The majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels, including national and regional sporting goods chains, independent and specialty retailers, department store chains, mono-branded Under Armour retail stores in certain international markets, institutional athletic departments and leagues and teams. In various countries where we do not have direct sales operations, we sell our products to independent distributors or engage licensees to sell our products.

We also sell our products directly to consumers through our global network of Brand and Factory House stores and e-commerce websites. Factory House store products are specifically designed for sale in our Factory House stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management by allowing us to sell a portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products, while maintaining the pricing integrity of our brand in our other distribution channels. Consumers experience a premium expression of our brand through our Brand House stores while having broader access to our performance products. In Fiscal 2021, sales through our wholesale, direct-to-consumer and licensing channels represented 57%, 41% and 2% of net revenues, respectively.

Our primary business operates in four geographic segments: (1) North America, comprising the United States and Canada, (2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), (3) Asia-Pacific, and (4) Latin America. These geographic segments operate predominantly in one industry: developing, marketing and distributing branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. Refer to Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net revenues by segment. 

Corporate Other consists mainly of general and administrative expenses not allocated to an operating segment, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments such as global marketing, global IT, global supply chain, innovation and other corporate support functions; costs related to our global assets and global marketing, costs related to our headquarters; restructuring and restructuring-related charges; and certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses. Corporate Other also includes the operating results of our MapMyFitness digital platform, which includes MapMyRun® and MapMyRide® as well as other digital business opportunities.

Our North America segment accounted for approximately 67% of our net revenues for Fiscal 2021, while our international segments represented approximately 33%. For Fiscal 2021, one customer in North America accounted for approximately 11% of the Company's net revenues.

North America

We sell our apparel, footwear and accessories in North America through our wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. Net revenues generated from the sales of our products in the United States were $3.5 billion and $2.7 billion for Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively. 

Our direct-to-consumer sales are generated through our Brand and Factory House stores and e-commerce website. As of December 31, 2021, in North America, we had 180 Factory House stores primarily located in outlet centers and 19 Brand House stores throughout the United States and Canada. Consumers can also purchase our products directly from our e-commerce website at either www.underarmour.com or www.ua.com.

In addition, we earn licensing revenue in North America based on our licensees’ sale of collegiate apparel and accessories, as well as sales of other licensed products. 

We distribute the majority of our products to our North American wholesale customers and our own retail stores and e-commerce businesses from distribution facilities we lease and operate in California, Maryland and Tennessee. In addition, we distribute our products in North America through third-party logistics providers with 

4
primary locations in Canada, New Jersey and Florida. In some instances, we arrange to have products shipped directly to customer-designated facilities from the factories that manufacture our products.

EMEA

We sell our apparel, footwear and accessories in EMEA primarily through wholesale customers and independent distributors, along with e-commerce websites and Brand and Factory House stores we operate within Europe. We also sell our branded products to various sports clubs and teams in Europe. We generally distribute our products to our retail customers and e-commerce consumers in Europe through a third-party logistics provider in the Netherlands and a bonded warehouse in the United Kingdom. We sell our apparel, footwear and accessories through independent distributors in the Middle East, Africa and Russia. 

Asia-Pacific

We sell our apparel, footwear and accessories products in China, South Korea, Australia, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand through stores operated by our distribution and wholesale partners, along with e-commerce websites and Brand and Factory House stores that we own and operate. We also sell our products to distributors in New Zealand, Taiwan, Hong Kong, India and other countries in Southeast Asia where we do not have direct sales operations. We distribute our products in Asia-Pacific through third-party logistics providers based in Hong Kong, China, South Korea and Australia.

We have a license agreement with a partner in Japan, which produces, markets and sells our branded apparel, footwear and accessories. Our branded products are sold in this market to large sporting goods retailers, independent specialty stores, professional sports teams and licensee-owned retail stores. We hold a non-controlling stake in our partner.

Latin America

In Fiscal 2021, we transitioned away from direct sales operations to distributors in several countries within the Latin America region. We currently sell our apparel, footwear and accessories in Mexico through wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. In countries where we no longer have direct sales operations, such as Chile, Argentina, Colombia and Brazil, we distribute our products through independent distributors, sourced primarily through our international distribution hub in Panama. 

Product Design and Development

Our products are developed by internal product development teams and manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties. This approach enables us to select and create superior, technically advanced materials, curated to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on style, performance and fit. 

We seek to deliver superior performance in all products, with a mission to make athletes better. Our developers proactively identify opportunities to create and improve performance products that meet the evolving needs of our consumers. We design products with consumer-valued technologies, utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance consumer perception and understanding of product use and benefits.

Our product development team also works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams and with professional and collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs.

Sourcing, Manufacturing and Quality Assurance

Many specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our apparel products are technically advanced products developed by third parties. The fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our apparel products are sourced by our contracted manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us. In Fiscal 2021, our top five suppliers provided approximately 38% of the fabric used in our apparel and accessories. These fabric suppliers have primary locations in Taiwan, China, Malaysia and Vietnam. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic and involve raw materials, including petroleum-based products that may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages. We also use cotton as a blended fabric in some of our apparel products. Cotton is a commodity that is subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages. Additionally, our footwear uses raw materials sourced from a diverse base of third-party suppliers. This includes chemicals and petroleum-based components such as rubber that are also subject to price fluctuations and supply shortages.

Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers. In Fiscal 2021, our apparel and accessories products were manufactured by 29 primary contract manufacturers, operating in 18 countries, with 

5
approximately 67% of our apparel and accessories products manufactured in Vietnam, Jordan, Malaysia, Cambodia and China. Of our 29 primary contract manufacturers, ten produced approximately 65% of our apparel and accessories products. In Fiscal 2021, substantially all of our footwear products were manufactured by six primary contract manufacturers, operating primarily in Vietnam, Indonesia and China.

All manufacturers across all product divisions are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our internal teams before being selected and on an ongoing basis. Where appropriate, we strive to qualify multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. We also seek vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us control our cost of goods sold. We enter into various agreements with our contract manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements. We require that manufacturers adhere to a supplier code of conduct regarding manufacturing quality, working conditions and other social, labor and sustainability-related matters. However, we do not have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any particular manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products for the long term. We have subsidiaries strategically located near our key partners to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts. 

Inventory Management

Inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our business. We manage our inventory levels based on existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid delivery requirements of our customers. Our inventory strategy is focused on meeting consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. These systems and processes, including our global operating and financial reporting information technology system, are designed to improve forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition to systems and processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are added discipline around product purchasing, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling excess inventory through our Factory House stores and other liquidation channels.

Our practice, and the general practice in the apparel, footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. As it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. 

Intellectual Property

We believe we own the material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of our products, domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the UA Logo and UNDER ARMOUR®, both of which are registered in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan, China and numerous other countries. We also own trademark registrations for other trademarks including, among others, UA®, ARMOUR®, HEATGEAR®, COLDGEAR®, PROTECT THIS HOUSE®, I WILL®, and many trademarks that incorporate the term ARMOUR such as ARMOUR FLEECE® and ARMOUR BRATM. We also own registrations to protect our connected fitness branding such as MapMyFitness® and associated MapMy marks. We own domain names for our primary trademarks (most notably underarmour.com and ua.com) and hold copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. We will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally.

We believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others. These trademarks are among our most valuable assets. In addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace.

We traditionally have had limited patent protection on some of the technology, materials and processes used in the manufacture of our products. In addition, patents are increasingly important with respect to our innovative products and new businesses and investments. As we continue to expand and drive innovation in our products, we seek patent protection on products, features and concepts we believe to be strategic and important to our business. We will continue to file patent applications where we deem appropriate to protect our new products, 

6
innovations and designs that align with our corporate strategy. We expect the number of applications to increase as our business grows and as we continue to expand our products and innovate.

Competition

The market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. Our most direct competitors include, among others, NIKE, Adidas, Puma and lululemon athletica, which are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us. Within our international markets, we also compete with local brands that may have stronger brand recognition regionally. Many of the fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are not unique to us, and we own a limited number of fabric or process patents. We also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in performance apparel and footwear, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers.

In addition, we must compete with others for purchasing decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. We believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have developed and the strong sales of our products. However, if retailers earn higher margins from our competitors’ products, they may favor the display and sale of those products.

We believe we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. We also believe our focus on athletic performance product style and merchandising differentiates us from our competition. In the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and may face greater competition on pricing. This may favor larger competitors with lower production costs per unit that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. The purchasing decisions of consumers for our products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements, preferences for inclusive products and brands and changing styles and trends.

Sustainability

At Under Armour, our mission is to make athletes better. Our sustainability strategy sets forth our long-term commitment to finding new ways to drive performance through sustainable innovations that not only deliver a better product for athletes, but also a better world. We have always been focused on product innovation, and we are challenging ourselves to be more innovative to increase the sustainability, durability and recyclability of our products and to reduce the impact of our design, development and manufacturing processes on the environment. We are exploring more ways to use digital technology to elevate the experience of our customers and consumers while also reducing the impact of our operations on the environment. For example, we have created realistic, but fully virtual, digital showrooms to display products for upcoming seasons to our customers, allowing us to produce and ship fewer physical product samples.

Our sustainability strategy is centered around three interconnected pillars—our products, our teammates and our home field—and focuses on enabling materials innovation to bring about a more circular system, championing our teammates and communities across our entire value chain and leaving our planet and shared spaces bettered by our presence. Increasingly, we are working with our supply chain to embed sustainable practices, and be mindful about the sustainability profiles of key raw materials. In Fiscal 2021, we publicly announced certain environmental and sustainability goals for 2025, 2030 and 2050 that focus on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and increasing our annual sourcing of renewable electricity in our owned and operated facilities. These goals, which can be found on our website, are grounded in science and an assessment of where our operations have the most significant impact on the environment. 

Human Capital Management 

Under Armour is led by its purpose—We Empower Those Who Strive for More—and our teammates, who bring their different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives, are central to driving our long-term success as an organization and brand. Consistent with our purpose, we believe that our brand is stronger when our collective team is fully engaged and working together to support our athletes around the world. We also believe that having an engaged, diverse and committed workforce not only enhances our culture, it drives our business success, ultimately helping us to deliver the most innovative products that make athletes better. Our human capital management 

7
strategy is therefore focused on creating an inclusive workplace where our teammates can thrive by attracting, developing and retaining talent through a competitive total rewards program, numerous development opportunities and a diverse, inclusive and engaging work environment. 

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 17,500 teammates worldwide, including approximately 13,000 in our Brand and Factory House stores and approximately 1,300 at our distribution facilities. Approximately 7,100 of our teammates were full-time. Of our approximately 10,400 part-time teammates, approximately 29% were seasonal teammates. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion starts at the top with a highly skilled and diverse Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has ongoing oversight of our human capital management strategies and programs and regularly reviews our progress towards achieving our diversity, equity and inclusion goals.

We have set measurable goals for improving diversity amongst our team, including a commitment to increase the number of historically underrepresented teammates throughout the levels of leadership within our organization by 2023. These goals are publicly outlined on our corporate website, where we also publish our representation statistics annually. We are also committed to continuing to increase representation of women in key areas of our business particularly in leadership, commercial and technical roles globally. Our annual incentive plan for all teammates, including executives, incorporates performance measures in furtherance of our diversity, equity and inclusion goals.

As of December 31, 2021: 

•the race and ethnicity of our teammate population in the United States, including teammates in our Brand and Factory House stores and our distribution facilities, was 49% White, 23% Hispanic or Latino, 18% Black or African American, 6% Asian and 4% other; 

•the race and ethnicity of our "director" level and above positions in the United States was 75% White, 6% Hispanic or Latino, 8% Black or African American, 8% Asian and 3% other; and

•52% of our global teammates were women, and women represented 41% of our “director” level and above positions.

In addition to building a more diverse team, we believe fostering an inclusive and ethical culture is key to our values and who we are as an organization. We believe open lines of communication are critical to fostering this environment. This starts with “tone at the top” and we emphasize the importance of our Code of Conduct and encourage our teammates to “speak-up” when they have concerns. We require unconscious bias training for all of our corporate teammates and our retail and distribution facility leadership, including training focused on promoting diversity during our new-hire interview process. In Fiscal 2021, we continued a company-wide virtual series to facilitate meaningful conversations on anti-racism and racial justice issues. For our senior leadership, we require mandatory training on cultural competency and building inclusive environments. We also invest in professional development specifically for our historically underrepresented and women teammates to improve retention and advancement. We currently have nine teammate-led Teammate Resource Groups, which amplify business initiatives, provide networking opportunities, support community outreach and promote cultural awareness. In addition, we have an internal diversity, equity and inclusion council, known as the Global T.E.A.M. (Teammate Equity and Accountability Movement) Council, which consists of “director” level and above corporate teammates and focuses on fostering a diverse and inclusive work environment across our organization.

Total Rewards

Our total rewards strategy is focused on providing market competitive and internally equitable total rewards packages that allow us to attract, engage and retain a talented, diverse and inclusive workforce. In determining our compensation practices, we focus on offering competitive pay that is based on market data with packages that appropriately reflect roles and geographic locations. We believe in “pay for performance” and seek to design plans and programs to support a culture of high performance where we reward what is accomplished and how. In May 2021, we announced an increase in minimum pay rate for hourly teammates in the United States and Canada from a minimum of $10 per hour to $15 per hour ($15.25 Canadian dollars per hour in Canada), which went into effect on June 6, 2021. We are also committed to achieving pay equity within all teammate populations, and with the assistance of third-party experts, conduct an annual review of pay equity and market comparison data. When we identify opportunities, we take prompt actions to close any gaps.

Our total rewards programs, which are outlined on the careers page of our corporate website, are aimed at the varying health, financial and home-life needs of our teammates. In the United States, where approximately 69% of our workforce is located, in addition to market-competitive pay and broad-based bonuses, our full-time 

8
teammates are eligible for healthcare benefits; health savings accounts; flexible spending accounts; retirement savings plan; paid time off; family, maternity and paternity leave; adoption assistance; child and adult care resources; flexible work schedules; short and long term disability; life and accident insurance; tuition assistance; fitness benefits at on-site gyms or eligible fitness programs; commuter benefits; Under Armour merchandise discounts; and a Work-Life Assistance Program. We believe in promoting alignment between our teammates and stockholders. As such, these teammates are also eligible to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and corporate teammates within our “director” level and above positions receive restricted stock unit awards as a key component of their total compensation package. Outside of the United States, we provide similarly competitive benefit packages to those of our U.S. teammates but tailored to market-specific practices and needs.

We believe that giving back to the communities where we live and work is central to our culture. In addition to competitive time off benefits, our full-time teammates also receive 40 hours of additional paid time off each year for personal volunteer activities performed during working hours.

Talent Development and Engagement

Our purpose of empowering those who strive for more is embodied in our commitment to helping our teammates develop their skills, grow their careers and achieve their goals. We believe our investment in these areas enhances our teammate engagement, improves the efficiency and productivity of our work and ultimately drives better results for our business. We prioritize and invest in a wide range of training and development opportunities for teammates at all levels, including through both online and instructor-led internal and external programs. All of our teammates have access to an online learning platform and knowledge database, Armour U, which offers an extensive, regularly updated library of seminars on a variety of topics. We also offer resources to support individual development planning, including emphasizing development opportunities as part of teammates’ annual goal setting process.

We invest in developing the leadership strength and capabilities of people-leaders at all levels, including through trainings focused on how to effectively manage, communicate with and drive the performance of teams. Through our succession planning efforts, we further focus on talent development for key roles within our organization.

We believe these efforts keep our teammates engaged and motivated to do their best work. However, competition for employees in our industry is intense, and we regularly collect feedback to better understand and improve our teammate experience and identify opportunities to continually strengthen our culture. See “Risk Factors—Business and Operational Risks—Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees, and our continued ability to attract and retain highly talented new team members” included in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Health and Safety

In Fiscal 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to present unprecedented challenges to our business, our communities, our athletes and our teammates. As we managed through these challenges, we prioritized the health, safety and overall well-being of our teammates. We have a COVID-19 sick leave policy, which offers full-time and part-time teammates in the United States and Canada additional paid sick time if they are unable to work due to contracting COVID-19.

At each of our office, retail store and distribution house locations, we follow applicable local, state and national government regulations, laws and recommended guidance. At our distribution houses, which have remained open, we have implemented government-recommended COVID-19 prevention measures, including reworking all job areas to reduce close contact, implementing daily health screening questions and temperature checks, enhancing cleaning protocols, requiring face coverings and social distancing and adding physical distancing barriers and increased hand sanitizing stations. Following significant store closures during Fiscal 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, during Fiscal 2021, most of our Brand and Factory House retail stores remained open, subject to varying capacity constraints and other operating restrictions. In addition to requiring daily teammate wellness assessments, we have implemented COVID-19 prevention measures at these locations similar to those described above. With respect to our corporate teammates, many of our corporate offices (including our global headquarters) have reopened in a limited capacity with teammates permitted to return to work on a voluntary basis. However, the majority of our corporate teammates have continued to work partially, if not entirely, remotely. We offer resources for teammates working remotely, which are targeted at optimizing remote work environments and managing COVID-19 related challenges and address topics such as office ergonomics and mental and emotional health and well-being. During Fiscal 2021, we implemented new COVID-19 vaccine policies and procedures for our corporate teammates in the United States and Canada, as well as incentive programs for our retail and distribution teammates. We have 

9
provided the ability for our teammates to receive the vaccine by offering on-site vaccination clinics at our various facilities.
