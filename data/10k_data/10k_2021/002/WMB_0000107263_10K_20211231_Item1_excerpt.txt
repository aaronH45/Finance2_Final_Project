Service Assets, Customers, and Contracts

Key variables for our businesses will continue to be: 

•Obstacles to our expansion efforts, including delays or denials of necessary permits and opposition to hydrocarbon-based energy development;

•Producer drilling activities impacting natural gas supplies supporting our gathering and processing volumes;

•Retaining and attracting customers by continuing to provide reliable services;

•Revenue growth associated with additional infrastructure either completed or currently under construction;

•Prices impacting our commodity-based activities; 

•Disciplined growth in our service areas.

Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Assets

Our interstate natural gas pipelines, which are presented in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” are subject to regulation by the FERC and as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce are subject to regulation. The rates are established primarily through the FERC’s ratemaking process, but we also may negotiate rates with our customers pursuant to the terms of our tariffs and FERC policy.

Our interstate natural gas pipelines transport and store natural gas for a broad mix of customers, including local natural gas distribution companies, public utilities, municipalities, direct industrial users, electric power generators, and natural gas marketers and producers. Our interstate natural gas transmission businesses are fully contracted under long-term firm reservation contracts with high credit quality customers. These contracts have various expiration dates and account for the major portion of our regulated businesses. Additionally, we offer storage 

5

services and interruptible transportation services under shorter-term agreements. Transco’s and Northwest Pipeline’s three largest customers in 2021 accounted for approximately 26 percent and 52 percent, respectively, of their total operating revenues.

Gathering, Processing, and Treating Assets

Our gathering, processing, and treating operations are presented within our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico, Northeast G&P, and West reporting segments as described under the heading “Business Segments.”

Our gathering systems receive natural gas from producers’ crude oil and natural gas wells and gather these volumes to gas processing, treating, or redelivery facilities. Typically, natural gas, in its raw form, is not acceptable for transportation in major interstate natural gas pipelines or for commercial use as a fuel. Our treating facilities remove water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants, and collect condensate. We are generally paid a fee based on the volume of natural gas gathered and/or treated, generally measured in the Btu heating value.

In addition, natural gas contains various amounts of NGLs, which generally have a higher value when separated from the natural gas stream. Our processing plants extract the NGLs, which include ethane, primarily used in the petrochemical industry; propane, used for heating, fuel, and also in the petrochemical industry; and, normal butane, isobutane, and natural gasoline, primarily used by the refining industry.

Our gas processing services generate revenues primarily from the following types of contracts:

•Fee-based: We are paid a fee based on the volume of natural gas processed, generally measured in the Btu heating value. A portion of our fee-based processing revenue includes a share of the margins on the NGLs produced. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 90 percent of our NGL production volumes were under fee-based contracts.

•Noncash commodity-based: We also process gas under two types of commodity-based contracts, keep-whole and percent-of-liquids, where we receive consideration for our services in the form of NGLs. For a keep-whole arrangement we replace the Btu content of the retained NGLs with natural gas purchases, also known as shrink replacement gas. For a percent-of-liquids arrangement, we deliver an agreed-upon percentage of the extracted NGLs and retain the remainder. Retained NGLs are referred to as our equity NGL production. Per-unit NGL margins are calculated based on sales of our own equity volumes at the processing plants. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 10 percent of our NGL production volumes were under noncash commodity-based contracts. 

Generally, our gathering and processing agreements are long-term agreements, with terms ranging from month-to-month to the life of the producing lease. Certain contracts include cost of service mechanisms that are designed to support a return on invested capital and allow our gathering rates to be adjusted, subject to specified caps in certain cases, to account for variability in volume, capital expenditures, commodity price fluctuations, compression, and other expenses. We also have certain gas gathering and processing agreements with MVC, whereby the customer is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based on any shortfall between the actual gathered and processed volumes and the MVC for a stated period.

Demand for gas gathering and processing services is dependent on producers’ drilling activities, which is impacted by the strength of the economy, commodity prices, and the resulting demand for natural gas by manufacturing and industrial companies and consumers. Our gathering, processing, and treating businesses do not have direct exposure to crude oil prices. Our on-shore natural gas gathering and processing businesses are substantially focused on gas-directed drilling basins rather than crude oil, with a broad diversity of basins and customers served. Declines in crude oil drilling would be expected to result in less associated natural gas production, which could drive more demand for natural gas produced from gas-directed basins we serve. 

During 2021, our facilities gathered and processed gas and crude oil for approximately 220 customers. Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 75 percent of our gathering and processing fee revenues and NGL margins from our noncash commodity-based agreements. We believe counterparty credit concerns in our gathering 

6

and processing businesses are significantly mitigated by the physical nature of our services, where we gather at the wellhead and are therefore critical to a producer’s ability to move product to market. 

Gas and NGL Marketing

Prior to the organizational realignment described under the heading “Business Segments,” certain of our commodity marketing activities were presented within our West reporting segment, while those acquired in 2021 as part of our Sequent Acquisition, which includes the operations of Sequent Energy Management, L.P. and Sequent Energy Canada, Corp. acquired on July 1, 2021 (Sequent Acquisition), were reported within the Sequent segment. Beginning in January 2022, our NGL and natural gas marketing services are now presented primarily within our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment. We market natural gas and NGL products to a wide range of users in the energy and petrochemical industries. In 2021, our three largest natural gas marketing customers accounted for approximately 13 percent of our gross natural gas marketing sales, and our three largest NGL marketing customers accounted for approximately 46 percent of our NGL marketing sales.

Our gas marketing business markets natural gas from the production at our upstream properties and provides asset management and the wholesale marketing, trading, storage, and transportation of natural gas for a diverse set of natural gas utilities, municipalities, power generators, and producers, and moves gas to markets through transportation and storage agreements on strategically positioned assets. Our pipeline agreements connect with multiple pipelines that provide our customers with access to diverse sources of supply and various natural gas markets. The southeastern market served by our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment is the fastest growing natural gas demand region in the United States and expands our natural gas marketing activities, as well as optimizes our pipeline and storage capabilities with expansions into new markets.

We purchase natural gas for storage when the current market price paid to buy and transport natural gas plus the cost to store and finance the natural gas is less than an estimated, forward market price that can be received in the future, resulting in positive net product sales. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and over-the-counter (OTC) contracts are used to sell natural gas at that future price to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the stored natural gas is sold. Additionally, we enter into transactions to secure transportation capacity between delivery points in order to serve our customers and various markets. Commodity-based exchange-traded futures contracts and OTC contracts are used to capture the price differential or spread between the locations served by the capacity in order to substantially protect the natural gas revenues that will ultimately be realized when the physical flow of natural gas between receipt and delivery points occurs. 

Monthly demand charges incurred for the contracted storage and transportation capacity and payments associated with asset management agreements are substantially indirectly reimbursed by our customers. As we are acting as an agent, our natural gas marketing revenues are presented net of the related costs of those activities. In addition, all of our Sequent’s derivative activities qualify as held for trading purposes, which requires net presentation in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Prior to the integration in 2022 of our historical gas marketing business with the acquired Sequent gas marketing business, natural gas marketing revenues and costs for our historical business were reported on a gross basis. Following the integration in 2022, the entire natural gas marketing portfolio is considered held for trading purposes, and the related revenues are therefore presented net of the related costs of those activities in 2022.

Our NGL marketing business transports and markets our equity NGLs from the production at our processing plants, NGLs from the production at our upstream properties, and also NGLs on behalf of third-party NGL producers, including some of our fee-based processing customers, as well as the NGL volumes owned by RMM and Discovery. The NGL marketing business bears the risk of price changes in these NGL volumes while they are being transported to final sales delivery points. In order to meet sales contract obligations, we may purchase products in the spot market for resale.

We are exposed to commodity price risk. To manage this volatility, we use various contracts in our marketing and trading activities that generally meet the definition of derivatives. We enter into commodity-related derivatives to hedge exposures to natural gas and NGLs and retain exposure to price changes that can, in a volatile energy market, be material and can adversely affect our results of operations.

7

We experience significant earnings volatility from the fair value accounting required for the derivatives used to hedge a portion of the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio. However, the unrealized fair value measurement gains and losses are generally offset by valuation changes in the economic value of the underlying transportation and storage portfolio, which is not recognized until the underlying transportation and storage transaction occurs.

Crude Oil Transportation and Production Handling Assets

Our crude oil transportation operations, which are presented in our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico segment as described under the heading “Business Segments,” earn revenues primarily from a combination of fixed-monthly fees, contractual fixed or variable fees applied to production volumes, and contributions in aid of construction (CIAC) arrangements. Generally, fixed-monthly fees associated with production handling and export revenues are recognized on a units-of-production basis utilizing either contractually determined maximum daily quantities or expected remaining production. CIAC arrangements are recognized based on a units of production basis, utilizing expected remaining production. Our crude oil transportation business is supported mostly by major oil producers with long-cycle perspectives.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, continues to present our segments as they were historically defined before the organizational realignment on January 1, 2022. 

Transmission & Gulf of Mexico

This segment includes the Transco interstate natural gas pipeline that extends from the Gulf of Mexico to the eastern seaboard, the Northwest Pipeline interstate natural gas pipeline, as well as natural gas gathering, processing and treating, crude oil production handling, and NGL fractionation assets within the onshore, offshore shelf, and deepwater areas in and around the Gulf Coast states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. This segment also includes various petrochemical and feedstock pipelines in the Gulf Coast region.

Transco

Transco is an interstate natural gas transmission company that owns and operates a 9,800-mile natural gas pipeline system, which is regulated by the FERC, extending from Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the Gulf of Mexico through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to the New York City metropolitan area. The system serves customers in Texas and 12 southeast and Atlantic seaboard states, including major metropolitan areas in Georgia, North Carolina, Washington, D.C., Maryland, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.

At December 31, 2021, Transco’s system had a system-wide delivery capacity totaling approximately 18.6 MMdth/d. During 2021, Transco completed two fully-contracted expansions, which added more than 0.5 MMdth/d interim firm transportation capacity to the pipeline. In addition, we added more than 0.1 MMdth/d of interim firm transportation capacity to our pipeline which will continue until the Regional Energy Access expansion project is placed in service, please refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Company Outlook.” Transco’s system includes 59 compressor stations, four underground storage fields, and one LNG storage facility. Compression facilities at sea level-rated capacity total approximately 2.4 million horsepower.

Transco has natural gas storage capacity in four underground storage fields located on or near its pipeline system or market areas and operates two of these storage fields. Transco also has storage capacity in an LNG storage facility that it owns and operates. The total usable gas storage capacity available to Transco and its customers in such underground storage fields and LNG storage facility and through storage service contracts is approximately 194 MMdth of natural gas. At December 31, 2021, Transco’s customers had stored in its facilities approximately 140 MMdth of natural gas. Storage capacity permits our customers to inject gas into storage during the summer and off-peak periods for delivery during peak winter demand periods.

Northwest Pipeline

Northwest Pipeline is an interstate natural gas transmission company that owns and operates a 3,900-mile natural gas pipeline system, which is regulated by the FERC, extending from the San Juan basin in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado through Colorado, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington to a point on the Canadian border near Sumas, Washington. Northwest Pipeline provides services for markets in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, California, and Arizona, either directly or indirectly through interconnections with other pipelines.

At December 31, 2021, Northwest Pipeline’s system had long-term firm transportation and storage redelivery agreements with aggregate capacity reservations of approximately 3.8 MMdth/d. Northwest Pipeline’s system includes 42 transmission compressor stations having a combined sea level-rated capacity of approximately 473,000 horsepower.

REGULATORY MATTERS 

FERC

Our gas pipeline interstate transmission and storage activities are subject to FERC regulation under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (NGA) and under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, and, as such, our rates and charges for the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce, accounting, and the extension, enlargement, or abandonment of our jurisdictional facilities, among other things, are subject to regulation. Each of our gas pipeline companies holds certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by the FERC authorizing ownership and operation of all pipelines, facilities, and properties for which certificates are required under the NGA. FERC Standards of Conduct govern how our interstate pipelines communicate and do business with gas marketing employees. Among other things, the Standards of Conduct require that interstate gas pipelines not operate their systems to preferentially benefit gas marketing functions.

FERC regulation requires all terms and conditions of service, including the rates charged, to be filed with and approved by the FERC before any changes can go into effect. Our interstate gas pipeline companies establish rates through the FERC’s ratemaking process. In addition, our interstate gas pipelines may enter into negotiated rate agreements where cost-based recourse rates are made available. Key determinants in the FERC ratemaking process include:

•Costs of providing service, including depreciation expense;

16

•Allowed rate of return, including the equity component of the capital structure and related income taxes;

•Contract and volume throughput assumptions.

The allowed rate of return is determined in each rate case. Rate design and the allocation of costs between the reservation and commodity rates also impact profitability. As a result of these proceedings, certain revenues previously collected may be subject to refund.

We also own interests in and operate natural gas liquids pipelines that are regulated by various federal and state governmental agencies. Services provided on our interstate natural gas liquids pipelines are subject to regulation under the Interstate Commerce Act by the FERC, which has authority over the terms and conditions of service; rates, including depreciation and amortization policies; and initiation of service. Our intrastate natural gas liquids pipelines providing common carrier service are subject to regulation by various state regulatory agencies. 

FERC Updates Certificate Policy Statement and Issues Interim Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Policy Statement

On February 18, 2022, FERC issued two policy statements providing guidance for its pending and future consideration of interstate natural gas pipeline projects. The first policy statement is an Updated Certificate Policy Statement, which FERC will apply in pending and future certificate proceedings. This policy statement provides an analytical framework for how FERC will consider whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity and explains that FERC will consider all impacts of a proposed project, including economic and environmental impacts, together. The second policy statement is an Interim GHG Policy Statement, which sets forth how FERC will assess the impacts of natural gas infrastructure projects on climate change in its reviews under the National Environmental Policy Act and the NGA. FERC also seeks comment on all aspects of the interim policy statement, including the approach to assessing the significance of the proposed project’s contribution to climate change. While the guidance is subject to revision based on the comments received, FERC will begin applying the framework established in this policy statement to pending cases.

Pipeline Safety

Our gas pipelines are subject to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002, the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Jobs Creation Act of 2011 (Pipeline Safety Act), and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act (PIPES Act) of 2016 and 2020, which regulate safety requirements in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of interstate natural gas transmission facilities. The United States Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) administers federal pipeline safety laws.

Federal pipeline safety laws authorize PHMSA to establish minimum safety standards for pipeline facilities and persons engaged in the transportation of gas or hazardous liquids by pipeline. These safety standards apply to the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities affecting interstate or foreign commerce. PHMSA has also established reporting requirements for operators of gas and hazardous liquid pipeline facilities, as well as provisions for establishing the qualification of pipeline personnel and requirements for managing the integrity of gas transmission and distribution lines and certain hazardous liquid pipelines. To ensure compliance with these provisions, PHMSA performs pipeline safety inspections and has the authority to initiate enforcement actions.

In October 2019, PHMSA published a final rulemaking imposing new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas pipelines including, expanding certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas lines in high-population areas (also known as moderate consequence areas (MCAs)) that do not qualify as high-consequence areas (HCAs) and requiring maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) validation through re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested. PHMSA split this rule (Mega Rule), into three separate rulemaking proceedings. The first of these three rulemakings, relating to onshore gas transmission pipelines, imposes numerous requirements, including MAOP reconfirmation, material and component verification, the periodic assessment of additional pipeline mileage outside of HCAs, the reporting of exceedances of MAOP, and the consideration of seismicity as a risk factor in integrity management. The second 

17

of these three rulemakings contains new repair requirements for HCAs and non-HCAs, and requires operators to inspect pipelines within 72 hours of extreme weather events or natural disasters. Operators will have to install or enhance leak detection systems, and make modifications to their pipeline systems to accommodate inline inspection tools. The third of these three rulemakings provides PHMSA with the authority to issue emergency orders to address imminent hazards, such as unsafe conditions or faulty components used on pipes.

In accordance with the final rule, we have developed new procedures and updated our existing pipeline safety program to facilitate meeting all requirements within the time frames stated. 

We are also expecting additional regulations due to the PIPES Act of 2020 that became law in December 2020. The PIPES Act of 2020 reauthorized PHMSA’s pipeline safety program through September 2023. The new legislation includes mandates for PHMSA to publish final rules for advanced leak detection for gas pipelines, additional repair criteria for gas and hazardous liquids pipelines, updated operating and maintenance standards requirements applicable to large-scale liquefied natural gas facilities, and certain coastal waters and coastal beaches to be designated as unusually sensitive areas ecological resources for purposes of determining whether a hazardous liquid pipeline is in a high consequence area.

In November 2021, in accordance with the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, PHMSA issued a final rule for onshore gas gathering pipelines. All gas gathering pipelines, including previously unregulated pipelines, will be subject to PHMSA’s annual and incident reporting requirements. The rule limits the use of “incidental gathering pipelines” to 10 miles in length or less. The rule also creates a new category of regulated gas gathering pipelines that are located in rural locations and will be subject to certain reporting and safety standards. The rule adds 400,000 miles of gas gathering lines under PHMSA jurisdiction, including approximately 5,400 miles and 4,500 miles of our regulated and unregulated pipelines, respectively.

New regulations adopted by PHMSA may impose more stringent requirements applicable to integrity management programs and other pipeline safety aspects of our operations, which could cause us to incur increased capital and operating costs and operational delays. 

Pipeline Integrity Regulations

We have an enterprise-wide Gas Integrity Management Plan that we believe meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The rule requires gas pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for gas transmission pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we have identified HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs have been completed. We estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2022 associated with this program to be approximately $129 million. Management considers costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business and, therefore, recoverable through Northwest Pipeline’s and Transco’s rates.

We have an enterprise-wide Liquid Integrity Management Plan that we believe meets the PHMSA final rule that was issued pursuant to the requirements of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002. The rule requires liquid pipeline operators to develop an integrity management program for liquid transmission pipelines that could affect HCAs in the event of pipeline failure. The integrity management program includes a baseline assessment plan along with periodic reassessments expected to be completed within required time frames. In meeting the integrity regulations, we utilized government defined HCAs and developed baseline assessment plans. We completed assessments within the required time frames. We estimate that the cost to be incurred in 2022 associated with this program will be approximately $4 million. Ongoing periodic reassessments and initial assessments of any new HCAs are expected to be completed within the time frames required by the rule. Management considers the costs associated with compliance with the rule to be prudent costs incurred in the ordinary course of business.

Cybersecurity Matters

The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) issued Security Directive Pipeline-2021-01 (Security Directive 1) on May 26, 2021, which required that owners/operators of critical pipelines to (1) report cybersecurity incidents to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) within 12 hours; (2) appoints a cybersecurity coordinator to coordinate with TSA and CISA; and (3) conduct a self-assessment of cybersecurity practices, identify any gaps, and develop a plan and timeline for remediation. We fully complied with the requirements of Security Directive 1 within the timeframe required. On July 19, 2021, the TSA issued Security Directive Pipeline-2021-02 (Security Directive 2), which required owners/operators of critical pipelines to implement additional cybersecurity measures to prevent disruption and degradation to their infrastructure in response to a purported ongoing threat. We have evaluated the impacts of Security Directive 2 and made significant progress towards compliance. We are coordinating with the TSA to establish action plans and timelines to remain in compliance with Security Directive 2.

See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “A breach of our information technology infrastructure, including a breach caused by a cybersecurity attack on us or third parties with whom we are interconnected, may interfere with the safe operation of our assets, result in the disclosure of personal or proprietary information, and harm our reputation.”

State Gathering Regulations

Our onshore midstream gathering operations are subject to laws and regulations in the various states in which we operate. For example, the Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate the terms of service for our intrastate natural gas gathering business in Texas. Although the applicable state regulations vary widely, they generally require that pipeline rates and practices be reasonable and nondiscriminatory, and may include provisions covering marketing, pricing, pollution, environment, and human health and safety. Some states, such as New York and Ohio, have specific regulations pertaining to the design, construction, and operations of gathering lines within such state. 

Intrastate Liquids Pipelines in the Gulf Coast

Our intrastate liquids pipelines in the Gulf Coast are regulated by the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources, the Texas Railroad Commission, and various other state and federal agencies. These pipelines are also subject to the liquid pipeline safety and integrity regulations discussed above since both Louisiana and Texas have adopted the integrity management regulations defined in PHMSA.

OCSLA

Our offshore gas and liquids pipelines located on the outer continental shelf are subject to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which provides in part that outer continental shelf pipelines “must provide open and nondiscriminatory access to both owner and non-owner shippers.”

See Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “The operation of our businesses might be adversely affected by regulatory proceedings, changes in government regulations or in their interpretation or implementation, or the introduction of new laws or regulations applicable to our businesses or our customers,” and “The natural gas sales, transportation, and storage operations of our gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the FERC, which could have an adverse impact on their ability to establish transportation and storage rates that would allow them to recover the full cost of operating their respective pipelines and storage assets, including a reasonable rate of return.”

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS 

Our operations are subject to federal environmental laws and regulations as well as the state, local, and tribal laws and regulations adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate. We could incur liability to governments or third parties for any unlawful discharge of pollutants into the air, soil, or water, as well as liability for cleanup costs. Materials could be released into the environment in several ways including, but not limited to:

19

•Leakage from gathering systems, underground gas storage caverns, pipelines, processing or treating facilities, transportation facilities, and storage tanks;

•Damage to facilities resulting from accidents during normal operations;

•Damages to onshore and offshore equipment and facilities resulting from storm events or natural disasters;

•Blowouts, cratering, and explosions.

In addition, we may be liable for environmental damage caused by former owners or operators of our properties.

We believe compliance with current environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or current competitive position. However, environmental laws and regulations could affect our business in various ways from time to time, including incurring capital and maintenance expenditures, fines and penalties, and creating the need to seek relief from the FERC for rate increases to recover the costs of certain capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses.

For additional information regarding the potential impact of federal, state, tribal, or local regulatory measures on our business and specific environmental issues, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” — “Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations relating to climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, which may expose us to significant costs, liabilities, and expenditures that could exceed our expectations,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Environmental” and “Environmental Matters” in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 19 – Contingent Liabilities and Commitments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

COMPETITION

Gathering and Processing

Competition for natural gas gathering, processing, treating, transporting, and storing natural gas as well as NGLs transportation, fractionation, and storage continues to increase as production from shales and other resource areas continues to grow. Our midstream services compete with similar facilities that are in the same proximity as our assets.

We face competition from companies of varying size and financial capabilities, including major and independent natural gas midstream providers, private equity firms, and major integrated oil and natural gas companies that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store, and market natural gas and NGLs, as well as some larger exploration and production companies that are choosing to develop midstream services to handle their own natural gas.

Our gathering and processing agreements are generally long-term agreements that may include acreage dedication. Competition for natural gas volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms (products retained or fees charged), array of services provided, efficiency and reliability of services, location of gathering facilities, available capacity, downstream interconnects, and latent capacity. We believe our significant presence in traditional prolific supply basins, our solid positions in growing shale plays, our expertise and reputation as a reliable operator, and our ability to offer integrated packages of services position us well against our competition.

Regulated Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage

The market for supplying natural gas is highly competitive and new pipelines, storage facilities, and other related services are expanding to service the growing demand for natural gas. Additionally, pipeline capacity in many growing natural gas supply basins is constrained causing competition to increase among pipeline companies as they strive to connect those basins to major natural gas demand centers. 

In our business, we predominately compete with major intrastate and interstate natural gas pipelines. In the last few years, local distribution companies have also started entering into the long-haul transportation business through 

20

joint venture pipelines. The principle elements of competition in the interstate natural gas pipeline business are based on capacity available, rates, reliability, quality of customer service, diversity of supply, and proximity to customers and market hubs. 

We face competition in a number of our key markets and we compete with other interstate and intrastate pipelines for deliveries to customers who can take deliveries at multiple points. Natural gas delivered on our system competes with alternative energy sources used to generate electricity such as hydroelectric power, coal, fuel oil, and nuclear. Future demand for natural gas within the power sector could be increased by regulations limiting or discouraging coal use or could be adversely affected by laws mandating or encouraging renewable power sources.

Significant entrance barriers to build new pipelines exist, including federal and growing state regulations and public opposition against new pipeline builds, and these factors will continue to impact potential competition for the foreseeable future. However, we believe our past success in working with regulators and the public, the position of our existing infrastructure, established strategic long-term contracts, and the fact that our pipelines have numerous receipt and delivery points along our systems provide us a competitive advantage, especially along the eastern seaboard and northwestern United States.

Energy Management and Marketing Services

Our Gas & NGL Marketing Services segment competes with national and regional full-service energy providers, producers and pipelines marketing affiliates or other marketing companies that aggregate commodities with transportation and storage capacity.

For additional information regarding competition for our services or otherwise affecting our business, please refer to Part 1, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” - “The financial condition of our natural gas transportation and midstream businesses is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas supplies in the supply basins that we access and demand for those supplies in the markets we serve,” “Our industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results,” and “We may not be able to replace, extend, or add additional customer contracts or contracted volumes on favorable terms, or at all, which could affect our financial condition, the amount of cash available to pay dividends, and our ability to grow.”

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES

We are committed to maintaining an environment that enables us to attract, develop, and retain a highly skilled and diverse group of talented employees who help promote long-term value creation. 

Employees

As of February 1, 2022, we had 4,783 full-time employees located throughout the United States. Of this total, approximately 21 percent are women and more than 16 percent are ethnically diverse. During 2021, our voluntary turnover rate was 6.0 percent.

We encourage you to review our 2020 Sustainability Report available on our website for more information about our human capital programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website shall be deemed incorporated by references into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Workforce Safety

We continue to advance our safety-first culture by developing and empowering our employees to operate our assets in a safe, reliable, and customer-focused way. We strive to continuously improve safety and achieve better performance than the industry benchmark. When a safety hazard is recognized, every employee is empowered to stop work activities and make it right. For 2020 and 2021, safety and environmental-focused goals and related metrics comprise 10 percent of our annual incentive program for employees, providing an increased focus on activities that help us meet enterprise safety commitments.

21

For 2020 and 2021, these metrics include our High Potential Near Miss to Incident Ratio, emphasizing our safety focus on high potential hazard recognition and reinforcing the importance of incident prevention, and our environmental metric Loss of Primary Containment, focused on reducing greenhouse gases and considered a leading indicator to more significant process safety incidents. For 2021, both our high potential near miss to incident ratio and loss of primary containment events exceeded their respective established targets. 

For 2022, in addition to the above, we added a third goal related to methane emission reductions. These three goals now comprise 15 percent of our annual incentive program for employees.

Workforce Health, Engagement, and Development

Our employees are our most valued resource, are instrumental in our mission to safely deliver products that fuel the clean energy economy, and are the driving force behind our reputation as a safe, reliable company that does the right thing, every time. Cultivating a healthy work environment increases productivity and promotes long-term value creation.

We provide a comprehensive total rewards program that includes base salary, an all-employee annual incentive program, retirement benefits, and health benefits, including wellness and employee assistance programs. We provide employees with company-paid life insurance, disability coverage, and paid parental leave for both birth and non-birth parents. Our annual incentive program is a key component of our commitment to a performance culture focused on recognizing and rewarding high performance.

In order to attract and retain top talent, we create and are committed to maintaining a safe, inclusive workplace where employees feel valued, heard, respected, and supported in their personal and professional development. We offer robust corporate and technical training programs to support the professional development of our employees and add long-term value to our business. Additionally, we support strong employee engagement by encouraging open dialogue regarding professional development and succession planning. Performance is measured considering both the achieved results associated with attaining annual goals and observable skills and behaviors based on our defined competencies that contribute to workplace effectiveness and career success.

Additionally, we are committed to strengthening the communities where we operate through philanthropic giving and volunteerism. We support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math education initiatives, environmental conservation and first responder efforts, and the work of United Way agencies across the United States. 

The Compensation and Management Development Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the establishment and administration of our compensation programs, including incentive compensation and equity-based plans.

In response to the ongoing impact of coronavirus, including its variants (COVID-19), we took action to safeguard the health and safety of our employees, including allowing our employees to work remotely where possible, while implementing safety guidance and best practices designed to protect the health of those entering our facilities.

Diversity & Inclusion

We are committed to creating an inclusive culture, where diverse differences are embraced and employees feel valued, welcomed, appreciated, and compelled to reach their full potential. We believe that inclusion fosters innovation, collaboration, and drives business growth and long-term success. To create a culture of inclusion, we embrace, appreciate, and fully leverage the diversity within our teams, including gender, race and ethnicity, life experiences, thoughts, perspectives, and anything that makes us different from one another. We believe that incorporating our many differences into a team of people who are working toward the same goal gives us a competitive advantage. 

To create space for employees to share personal experiences and perspectives, and to appreciate and celebrate what makes people different, we offer Employee Resource Groups (ERGs). These groups are employee-led and 

22

based on similar interests and experiences, represent diverse communities and their allies, and are open to everyone. ERG members participate in community events, volunteer, lend professional and personal support to one another, and promote inclusion across the company. They also provide input to the leadership team. 

We are committed to helping all employees develop and succeed. We strive for diverse representation at all levels of the organization through our talent management practices and employee development programs, including required baseline diversity and inclusion training for all leaders across the company. Diversity metrics are reported monthly to our management team to identify trends and opportunities for improvement. 

Our Diversity and Inclusion Council - chaired by our chief executive officer and including members of the executive officer team, organizational and operational leaders, and individual employees - promotes policies, practices, and procedures that support the growth of a high-performing workforce where all individuals can achieve their full potential. The council serves as the governing body over enterprise diversity and inclusion initiatives, including a quarterly candid conversation meeting for all employees, 10 active ERGs, and annual awards that recognize an outstanding leader and an individual contributor who champion inclusion.

As of December 31, 2021, our Board of Directors includes 12 members, 11 of whom are independent members and approximately one-quarter of which are women. As part of the director selection and nominating process, the Governance and Sustainability Committee annually assesses the Board’s diversity in areas such as geography, gender, race and ethnicity, and age. We strive to maintain a board of directors with diverse occupational and personal backgrounds.
