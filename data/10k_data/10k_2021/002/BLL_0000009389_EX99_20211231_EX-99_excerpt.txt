Exhibit 99

​

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995

​

In connection with the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act), Ball is hereby filing cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause Ball’s actual results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball. Forward-looking statements may be made in several different contexts; for example, in the company’s Form 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), quarterly and annual earnings news releases, quarterly earnings conference calls hosted by the company, public presentations at investor and credit conferences, the company’s Annual Report and in other periodic communications with investors. As time passes, the relevance and accuracy of forward-looking statements may change; however, except as required by law, the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise. You are advised to consult any further disclosures and cautionary statements Ball makes on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports and other filings with the SEC. The Reform Act defines forward-looking statements as statements that express or imply an expectation or belief and contain a projection, plan or assumption with regard to, among other things, future revenues, income, earnings per share, cash flow or capital structure. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” “believes,” “targets,” “likely,” “foresees”, “positions” and similar expressions typically identify forward-looking statements, which are generally any statements other than statements of historical fact. These forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and you should therefore not place undue reliance upon such statements. Rather, these statements involve estimates, assumptions uncertainties and known and unknown risks, many of which are outside our control, and such statements are therefore qualified in their entirety by reference to the following important factors, among others (including those described in any “Risk Factors” section of our most current Form 10-K, 10-Q or other filings with the SEC), that could cause Ball’s actual results or performance to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of Ball:
