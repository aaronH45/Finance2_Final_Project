Item 1. BUSINESS

Overview. Teradata Corporation ("we," "us," "Teradata," or the "Company") is a provider of a leading connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics, focused on helping companies leverage all their data across an enterprise, at scale. In doing so, we help companies to find answers to their toughest business challenges. All of our 

4
efforts are in support of our purpose of transforming how businesses work and people live through the power of data. 

Teradata has broadened its market opportunity by evolving from an on-premises only, enterprise data warehouse company to a provider of a connected multi-cloud, data platform for enterprise analytics. We help our customers integrate and simplify their data and analytics ecosystem, streamline access and management of data, and use analytics to derive business value from diverse data types. Our target market focuses on organizations that are the world's most demanding, large-scale users of data.

The largest companies in the world have spent decades building mission-critical, complex, and large-scale on-premises data environments. However, these companies face significant challenges from ecosystems that have grown over time, including siloed data and conflicting and duplicative solutions, resulting in environments that are highly complex and expensive to maintain and manage. Despite these companies investing heavily in technology, people, and infrastructure, their employees are unable to effectively access the data they need to efficiently run their businesses or activate data to make decisions that will optimize their business outcomes. In addition, most of these organizations are also experiencing a dramatic increase in data volumes and complexity due to digital transformation. 

As companies seek greater agility and flexibility demanded by today’s digitalized and highly disruptive economy, they are turning to cloud infrastructures. By accessing a data and analytics platform integrated within a cloud-based ecosystem, companies can flexibly access and pay for capabilities on demand while being integrated with the elasticity of cloud. This provides companies the ability to deploy projects and initiatives with agility and expand as needed. Given the petabytes of data and the millions of queries executed daily on-premises, we expect that the journey to cloud will be a significant endeavor for our customers leading to hybrid ecosystems spanning on-premises and cloud for the foreseeable future. With companies pivoting to invest in the cloud, we believe it is essential for these enterprises to be able to integrate ecosystems across on-premises and multi-cloud environments, simplify access to data wherever it resides, and accommodate analytics at massive scale and speed. As a result, we believe that the market for our solutions and services is large and growing.

Our solution, Teradata Vantage™, is our data platform that allows companies to leverage all of their data across an enterprise, whether in public or private clouds, on-premises, or in a multi-cloud environment. It is designed to connect multiple sources of data to drive ecosystem simplification, deliver multi-dimensional scale and integration, and support customers on their journey to the cloud through an integrated migration. Teradata is a leader in enabling the migration of a company's data to a cloud based ecosystem by running the same software platform in all deployments (on-premises or cloud), providing software license portability, data and workload automation tools, as well as associated services.

Teradata Vantage also contains a secure, highly concurrent and resilient analytics engine that addresses the scalability demands of our target market, the global 10,000 enterprises. Vantage is an open platform offering full integration of datasets, tools, analytical languages and functions, including leading commercial and open source technologies. Teradata offers flexible purchase options for customers, via subscription offerings, or "pay for what you use" consumption pricing. These combined capabilities enable companies to reduce complexity, risk, and cost, while leveraging data as an asset in solving their business challenges and driving business outcomes, which can include, among other things:

•Digital identity management,

•Financial visibility,

•Resilient supply chains,

•Fraud prevention, and

•Operational resilience. 

Our business consulting services include a broad range of offerings, including support for organizations to establish a data and analytics vision, enable a multi-cloud ecosystem architecture, and identify and operationalize analytical opportunities to ensure their ecosystem investments deliver significant value. In addition, we offer robust support and maintenance services for our offerings.

5
Teradata operates from numerous locations within the United States with the primary locations being San Diego, California and Atlanta, Georgia. In addition, we have sales, services, research and development, and administrative offices located in 32 countries.

For the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, we had total revenues of $1.917 billion, of which approximately 54% was derived from the Americas region (North America and Latin America) and 46% from the International regions (Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific and Japan). For financial information about our segments and geographic information, see "Note 14-Segment, Other Supplemental Information and Concentrations" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

History. Teradata originated as a startup in a garage in Brentwood, California, and was incorporated in 1979 as a Delaware corporation, driven by the need for robust computing power to harness the value of aggregated data. After being acquired, Teradata eventually was spun off and became a publicly-traded company named Teradata Corporation (NYSE: TDC) on September 30, 2007.

Industry and Market Opportunity. Our view is that data and analytics continue to be a management priority for industry-leading companies. We believe that companies are facing significant ongoing increases in data volumes and proliferation of data silos. Furthermore, the agility provided by cloud-based technologies provides significant benefit, but also creates additional complexity, with the rise of ecosystems that must span multiple cloud and on-premises environments. These factors all contribute to the increased complexity, cost, and risk associated with managing data and analytic environments. This is particularly true for our target market of global enterprise companies, and we believe that these companies require tightly integrated solutions that can accommodate significant scale and speed. We are focused on both new customer acquisition as well as growth of software consumption within our large and established customer base.

As described in more detail below, we believe Teradata’s strategy positions us to address this large market opportunity within the growing multi-billion dollar data management and analytics markets. We believe our connected data platform will lead to reduced risk and cost for enterprises while enabling data insights and meaningful business value from analytics. We also believe our experience positions us to support these companies with the design and implementation of next generation secure, multi-cloud data and analytics ecosystems. We have tailored Teradata's offerings to provide flexibility and choice of deployment environments, whether on-premises or in one of the top public clouds, alongside portability of licenses, allowing companies to de-risk their investments.

Our Strategy. Teradata’s strategy is based on our differentiated value proposition for the top 10,000 largest enterprises in the world. Our strategy is to provide a multi-cloud data platform, Teradata Vantage. Teradata Vantage is a scalable, secure, highly concurrent and resilient data platform that is designed to help companies solve complex data challenges at scale. We provide a data management solution that enables enterprises to support their data and analytic ecosystems, and easily grow and scale. Furthermore, as demand shifts to the cloud, we provide customers with the ability to migrate their on-premises data environment to a cloud-based platform.

We believe we are differentiated by providing our platform offering across a secure, multi-cloud ecosystem. This includes the ability to simplify the management of an ecosystem that spans on-premises or private cloud platform instances, alongside deployments in any of the top public cloud offerings including Amazon Web Services ("AWS"), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. Furthermore, we augment these offerings with our "pay as you go" consumption pricing to provide flexibility for customers to expand capabilities on an as-needed basis. The multi-cloud capability and consumption pricing combine to enable our customers to de-risk their investments and buying decisions, as well as provide public cloud vendor flexibility. With cloud elasticity and our multi-dimensional scalability, customers can quickly grow their analytics to scale to provide robust business outcomes.

As customers increasingly grow their footprint in cloud, our strategy supports existing and new on-premises customers on that journey with the fastest path to migration that is enabled through license portability, the same software enabled whether on-premises or in the cloud, a data fabric that connects all environments, as well as data and workload migration tools and services. Through this differentiated set of offerings for our target market, we help customers build for the future, now. 

By prioritizing the fundamental capabilities of a modern multi-cloud data platform, we strive to reset expectations and market perceptions as to our cloud capabilities. We offer a competitive and compelling total cost of ownership 

6
by building out best-in-class capabilities that are designed to provide an easy experience for ingestion, exploration, development, consumption and operationalization of data and analytics. With an outstanding user experience and the flexibility of cloud, we are attracting new customers to grow from start, to enterprise scale, as well as migrating our existing customers to the extent they are ready to do so and at the pace they desire.

Furthermore, with increasingly fragmented ecosystems consisting of multiple data inputs, our strategy drives an open platform approach, enabling integration into cloud and partner ecosystems. This integration extends the data and analytical capabilities of our offerings, allowing our customers greater flexibility to leverage the tools of their choice, deployed on top of a scalable and robust data platform. By empowering customers and partners to build how they like, we believe that we enable hundreds of business outcomes and solutions. 

Our strategic objectives are to:

•Strengthen our multi-cloud data platform offering by building out next generation cloud capabilities;

•Reset market perceptions to establish Teradata’s position in the cloud market;

•Enable end-to-end business outcomes through a seamless user experience;

•Expand our product capabilities through deeper integration with cloud ecosystems;

•Focus on partner enablement to drive solution execution on Teradata Vantage; 

•Accelerate our transition to the cloud by supporting our customers on their migration journeys; 

•Deepen strategic public cloud service provider relationships;

•Expand our go-to-market reach by onboarding new customers, vertical investments, expanding customer success programs and strengthening our partner relationships; and

•Deliver operational excellence through efficient cost management and execution.

Our strategy is further supported by our commitment to be a responsible corporate citizen. We believe it is our responsibility to make a positive impact on and support important issues, such as addressing the climate crisis and environmental sustainability, promoting diversity, equity and inclusion and being a company that does not tolerate any form of racism, supporting communities where we live and work, protecting data privacy, and acting ethically in everything we do. We believe that we actively engage with our people in a way that is supportive of a culture where they can feel comfortable bringing their authentic and genuine selves to work.

Customers. Teradata concentrates our marketing and go-to-market efforts on enterprise companies, which we define as the 10,000 largest businesses in the world, which view data as a strategic asset, and we focus on both business users and technology buyers. We particularly focus on the following industries: Financial Services, Government, Healthcare, Manufacturing, Retail, Telecommunications, and Travel/Transportation. We believe that these industries provide a good fit for our analytic solutions and services as they typically have the greatest analytic potential with large and growing data volumes, as well as complex data management requirements, and large and varied groups of users. When looking at new customer acquisition, we aim to drive adoption of our Teradata Vantage software. In addition, we are engaging with our existing customer base to increase the awareness and use of Teradata's software, and in particular, supporting our customers with their journeys to the cloud and helping them exploit new uses of data and analytics to drive meaningful business outcomes.

We currently do not have any customer which represents 10% or more of our total revenue. We have been successful in converting customers from perpetual to subscription-based purchasing options, which results in more ratable revenue recognition. We believe this will increase the predictability of our revenue and the durability of our cash flows in the future. Due to the size and complexity of our sales transactions, however, our sales cycle can often be lengthy.

Seasonality. Historically, our new contract bookings and renewals are seasonal, in line with customer spending patterns, with lower volume typically in the first quarter and higher volume generally in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Such seasonality causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume, timing of invoices and subsequent collection, and mix of platform sales. Historically, cash provided by operating activities is higher in the first half of the year due to collections of the higher receivable balances at December 31 driven by the higher contract bookings in the fourth quarter and receipts from annual renewals of our maintenance support agreements. In addition, contract bookings in the third month of each quarter has historically been significantly higher than in the first and second months. These factors, among 

7
others as more fully described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect our ability to accurately predict financial results.

Sales, Marketing and Partners

Sales and Marketing. We primarily sell and market our solutions and services through a direct sales force. We have greater than 80% of our employees in customer-facing and/or revenue-driving roles (including sales, marketing, consulting, customer service, customer success, and product engineering).

We support our sales force with marketing and training programs that are designed to:

•Grow awareness and increase perception of Teradata as a multi-cloud leader, highlighting our technology leadership, differentiation, cloud, and analytics expertise; 

•Lead customers on their migration to the cloud with the benefits of multi-cloud and hybrid cloud capabilities;

•Create demand for, and adoption of, our Teradata Vantage data platform;

•Educate and enable the sales force with the skills and knowledge to deliver our value proposition; and 

•Provide a robust set of tools for use by our sales teams.

Teradata focuses our brand messaging on the Company’s strength as a provider of a connected multi-cloud data platform for enterprise analytics. To support the Company’s growth objectives, we employ a broad range of modern marketing strategies, including programs to inform, educate and generate demand with customers and prospects, as well as keep our leading technology position at the forefront of the media, industry analysts, academics, and other influencers. These strategies include targeted account-based marketing, our global website, digital marketing, demos and trials of our software, webinars, virtual conferences and events now, and physical events when again safe to do so post the global pandemic, public and media relations, social media, and an extensive customer reference program.

Strategic Partnerships. We seek to extend our sales and marketing reach by partnering with cloud service providers, alliance partners (including independent software vendors and open-source software distributors), leading global and regional systems integrators, consultants, and universities that we believe complement our differentiated offerings. Strategic partnerships are a key element in our ability to leverage the value and expand the scope of our data and analytics offering in the marketplace.

•Cloud Service Providers: Teradata has established partnerships with the top three global public cloud service providers: AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. We work to continuously strengthen these partnerships so that Teradata can provide companies around the globe access to Teradata’s Vantage offering in the public cloud, both in an As-A-Service or Do-It-Yourself model to accommodate customer preferences.

•Alliance Partners: Teradata has a focus on working collaboratively with independent software vendors in several areas, including tools, data and application integration solutions, data mining, analytics, business intelligence, and specific analytic and industry solutions. Our goal is to provide choices to our customers with partner offerings that are optimized and certified to work with Teradata Vantage to deliver end-to-end data and analytic solutions and to provide comprehensive capabilities that support the customer’s analytic ecosystem.

•Systems Integrators and Consultants: We also work with a range of systems integrators and consultants who engage in the design, implementation, and integration of data warehouse and analytic solutions and analytic applications for our joint customers. Our strategic partnerships with select global and regional consulting and systems integration firms provide broad industry and technology expertise in the design of business solutions that leverage Teradata technology to enable enterprise analytics.

Competition. We compete in a large and growing data management and analytics market that is attractive to both current and new competitors. Participants in our general market include traditional competitors such as IBM, Oracle, SAP, as well as new cloud-only data vendors (such as Amazon, Google, Snowflake), and open-source providers. We believe our focus on multi-cloud ecosystem simplification, providing solutions for the most scalable 

8
and complex workloads, and providing a product designed to achieve desired business outcomes of our customers, enables us to successfully compete within our target market. We believe that our Teradata Vantage platform is highly differentiated, delivers substantive scale and integration, and is uniquely positioned to provide significant business value to our customers. Furthermore, we provide our customers with the opportunity to de-risk their buying decisions with the ability to deploy across the top public clouds, private cloud and on-premises, coupled with flexibility in purchasing and portable licensing. For more information on competition, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report.

We believe that the principal competitive factors for our products and services include: data and analytics experience; business outcome delivery; multi-cloud offerings and experience; customer references; technology leadership; product quality; performance, scalability, availability, and manageability; support and consulting services capabilities; management of technologies in a complex analytical ecosystem; industry knowledge; and total cost of ownership. We believe we have a competitive advantage in providing complete, integrated, and optimized data and analytic capabilities that address customers’ business, technical, and architectural requirements. Our differentiation is especially strong in our target market of the world’s leading enterprises and their mission-critical, complex, large-scale environments and requirements.

Research and Development ("R&D"). We remain focused on designing and developing data warehouse technologies that anticipate our customers' evolving needs and support our customers in solving their most complex business challenges. Our teams are focused on extending our Teradata Vantage data platform to have consistent and differentiated capabilities for our customers’ multi-cloud and hybrid ecosystems. This includes simplifying the journey to cloud, as well as enabling a transformative cloud experience. With a focus on opening up the platform, we are building out deep integration with cloud data and analytic ecosystems, including advanced analytics and artificial intelligence tools. Furthermore, with a strong focus on partnerships, our R&D team is extending our platform to enable deeper partner integration with a broader range of solution and services providers. 

We believe our extensive and talented R&D workforce is one of our core strengths. Our R&D team is located in multiple locations around the world to take advantage of global engineering talent. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant R&D expenditures, which may include complementary strategic acquisitions, to help support the flow of innovative, high-quality cloud-based data and analytic offerings with a superior user experience, as well as services, which are vital to our leading competitive position. For information regarding the accounting and costs included in R&D activities, see "Note 1-Description of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.

Intellectual Property and Technology. The Company owns 632 patents in the United States. The Company also is the exclusive licensee of four additional patents in the United States and counterpart patents in foreign countries. Many of the patents that we own are licensed to others, and we are licensed to use certain patents owned by others. While our portfolio of patents and patent applications in aggregate is of significant value to our Company, we do not believe that any individual patent is by itself of material importance to our business.

In addition, the Company owns copyrights and trade secrets in our code base that comprises all of the Teradata software offerings, including analytic data platforms and analytic applications. Teradata’s software offerings reflect the investment of hundreds of person-years of development work.

The source code versions of our offerings are protected as trade secrets and, in all major markets, as unpublished copyright works. We take great efforts to protect our rights in all software offerings and related intellectual property; however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful. The Company owns the Teradata® word and logo trademarks, which are registered in the United States and in many foreign countries, as well as other trade names, service marks, and trademarks.

Sources of Materials. Our hardware components are assembled and configured by Flex Ltd. ("Flex"). Our platform line is designed to leverage the components from manufacturers that we believe are industry leaders. Our data storage devices and memory components utilize industry-standard technologies but are selected and configured to work optimally with our software and hardware platform. Flex also procures a wide variety of components used in the assembly process on our behalf. Although many of these components are available from multiple sources, Teradata utilizes preferred supplier relationships to better ensure more consistent quality, cost and delivery. Typically, these preferred suppliers maintain alternative processes and/or facilities to ensure business continuity of 

9
supply. Given our strategy to outsource product assembly activities to Flex and to source certain components from single suppliers, a disruption in production at Flex or at a supplier, a global shortage of components, commodity, transportation, and/or inflationary pressures could impact the timing or profitability of customer shipments. In addition, a significant change in the forecasts to any of these preferred suppliers could result in purchase obligations for components that may be in excess of demand. Although the Company has not experienced significant disruptions in its supplier relationships due to the COVID-19 pandemic, inflationary challenges, or otherwise, the ongoing pandemic and current inflation environment could present potential supply chain uncertainty, and the Company has implemented programs to mitigate these potential risks. For more information, see Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Annual Report.

Human Capital

Teradata’s people management objectives are to attract, retain, and develop the highest quality of diverse and inclusive talent, which allows our employees to thrive while positioning us to execute our Company strategy and drive profitable growth. Our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and innovative talent in all functional areas of our Company, with a heightened focus on sales and cloud talent. Competition for acquiring top talent and retaining our highly skilled people is intense throughout the IT industry. Our programs are designed to align to our core principles and focus on meaningful work, enabled management, a positive and inclusive workplace environment, career growth opportunities, and transparent and trustworthy leadership. We also provide complete flexibility to our workforce to choose whether they will work remote or hybrid, as well as offering competitive pay, and comprehensive health and wellness benefits and programs.

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 7,200 employees globally, with approximately 30% employed in the United States and 70% across the rest of the world. Our global workforce is critical to our overall business strategy across target markets. During fiscal 2021, our overall headcount decreased slightly as we continue to align our talent needs to drive our Company’s cloud-first and profitable growth strategy.

Culture Transformation. At Teradata, we transform how businesses work and people live through the power of data. We are deliberate in ensuring our culture supports our purpose and strategy. We embody our core principles in all we do; and we recognize and reward behavior aligned to our core principles. We believe every employee plays a role in transforming our culture to meet the needs of the future. We are committed to work, learn, and grow together to help ensure our success. 

We are committed to the following Core Principles to make sure we are fulfilling our purpose and truly bringing our brand to life:

•Accountability to Each Other

•Agility in Execution, and

•Customer and Market Driven.

We value every member of the team because bringing together different voices makes us stronger and accelerates the momentum we need to create true transformation together.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Teradata’s core strength is our people, and creating an inclusive workplace where everyone feels safe and welcome being their genuine and authentic selves is a key focus for us. We are an equal opportunity employer, committed to sustaining a world-class team by providing an environment that is intentionally inclusive and fully encourages and leverages diversity in all aspects of our business.

We have many people and culture initiatives, with a strong focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI").

•Our executive team and employee allies have signed a pledge committing to DEI and anti-racism. 

•We have a DEI Advisory Board to support the Company’s mission to eradicate racism and inequality in the workplace. 

•We provide resources and tools for our employees to help them engage within culturally- and geographically-dispersed work teams to enable a culture of growth, learning, and collaboration.

•We continue to empower our Inclusion Communities, which are networks of employees who unite based on shared characteristics, life experiences, or common interests. These communities are designed to provide support, networking and enhanced career and personal development. These networks include Teradata 

10
Alliance of Black Employees, Blend (a community for employees in India), Veterans Community, Teradata Pride, HISPA (Hispanic and Latin Allies), Women of Teradata, Green Agenda, Terabytes (work-life integration), Toastmasters International, and Asian and Pacific Islander Inclusion Community.

•In further support of the communities where we operate and live, we offer a global Diversity in Technology Scholarship Program for underrepresented minorities and women who are pursuing STEM-related degrees; and

•Teradata earned a score of 100 out of 100 in the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index 2022 (CEI), a benchmarking survey and report that measures corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ equality.

We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to the Company’s success, and we will continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of underrepresented minorities and women in technology.

Health, Safety, and Wellness. We are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs. Continuing in 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took several actions to promote the health and well-being of our employees, as described below under "COVID-19 Update" in Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis Of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A"). 

Compensation and Benefits. A key to our attraction, retention, and engagement strategies are the robust compensation and benefit programs we provide that are designed to meet the varied and evolving needs of a global and diverse workforce. In addition to our competitive base pay, these programs (which vary by country/region) include sales incentives, annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Savings Plan with a company match, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, and paid parental leave. As an example of our commitment to DEI, we ensure that all of our benefits provide coverage for domestic partners.

Talent Development. Teradata is committed to supporting the professional development of our employees by providing resources and tools that enable employees to manage their careers. Our talent programs provide employees with the resources to develop their careers, build leadership skills, and lead within their organizations. We have launched on-demand learning resources, such as LinkedIn Learning and Country Navigator, which give employees flexibility in when and how they learn. Our Learning Labs focus on understanding Culture Transformation and our Core Principles, Inclusive Leadership, and Building Your Personal Brand. We also provide executive and leadership development programs to help develop leaders at all levels.

Community Engagement. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace. We support local STEM education programs to ensure emerging leaders in our communities have opportunities to explore their interests. Our Teradata Cares program empowers our employees to help build strong and vibrant communities, improve quality of life, and make a positive difference where we live and work through volunteerism and giving. We support our employees’ giving and volunteer efforts by providing matching donations for employee contributions to qualified not-for-profit agencies, project grants, Annual Days of Caring, and supporting communities where we have employee populations. To further enable employees to support the charity of their choice, we afford every employee four days a year, during normal working hours, for volunteer efforts of their choice. 

Properties and Facilities. Our corporate headquarters is located in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2021, we operated 58 facilities in 32 countries throughout the world. We own our San Diego complex, while all other facilities are leased.
