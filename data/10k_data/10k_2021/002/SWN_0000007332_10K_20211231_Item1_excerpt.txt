PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we”, “our”, “us”, “the Company” or “Southwestern”) is an independent energy company engaged in exploration, development and production activities, including the related marketing of natural gas, associated natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and oil produced in our operations. Southwestern is a holding company whose assets consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and whose business is conducted substantially through, its subsidiaries. Currently we operate exclusively in the United States. Our common stock is listed and traded on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “SWN.”

Our Business Strategy

We aim to deliver economic returns and optimize our ability to generate free cash flow through responsible natural gas development. As we develop our core positions in the Appalachian and Haynesville natural gas basins in the U.S., we will concentrate on:

•Creating Value. We seek to create value for our stakeholders by allocating capital that is focused on earning economic returns; delivering free cash flow; upgrading the quality, depth and capital efficiency of our drilling inventory; and converting resources to proved reserves.

•Financial Strength. We intend to protect our financial strength by lowering our leverage ratio and total debt; extending the weighted average years to maturity of our debt; lowering our cost of debt; deploying hedges to protect against downward price movement; covering our costs and meeting other financial commitments; and maintaining a strong liquidity position.

•Focus on Execution. We are focused on operating effectively and efficiently with HSE and ESG as core values; building on our data analytics, operating execution, strategic sourcing, vertical integration and large-scale asset development expertise; further enhancing well performance, optimizing well costs and reducing base production declines; growing margins and securing flow assurance through commercial and marketing arrangements.

•Capturing the Tangible Benefits of Scale. We strive to create a competitive advantage through strategic transactions that we believe will enhance enterprise returns and deliver financial synergies and operational economies. We believe these transactions lower the risk of our business, expand our opportunity set, increase business optionality and build upon our demonstrated record of asset integration.

Our Company’s formula, “The Right People doing the Right Things, wisely investing the cash flow from our underlying Assets will create Value+,” guides how we conduct our business:

We strive to attract and retain strong talent, to work safely, to act ethically with steadfast vigilance for the environment and the communities in which we live and operate, and to apply technical skills to grow and develop our asset base. We believe these practices will enhance long-term value for our shareholders.

During 2021 we executed on this strategy by:

•Integrating the natural gas and liquids assets acquired in our November 2020 merger with Montage Resources Corporation (the “Montage Merger”), which expanded our operations in Appalachia;

•Expanding our operations into the Haynesville with the Indigo Merger and GEPH Merger. This expansion lowered our enterprise business risk, deepened our economic drilling inventory, expanded our business opportunity set and optionality and enabled immediate cost structure savings;

•Lowering our costs through drilling, completions, operational and administrative efficiencies and optimizing gathering and transportation;

•Focusing on delivering operational results, such as improved well productivity and economics from enhanced completion techniques, optimization of surface equipment and managing reservoir drawdown as well as base production declines;

•Announced and began implementing responsibly sourced gas certification and continuous emissions monitoring of Appalachia production;

•Maintaining a multi-year hedging program to protect cash flow from adverse price changes;

•Lowering our cost of debt, expanding our liquidity, extending the weighted average years to maturity of our debt and improving our credit ratings through financings to fund the cash consideration for the Indigo Merger and GEPH Merger (as defined below) and associated liability management; and

•Publishing our 8th Annual Corporate Responsibility report (available at www.swn.com).

Note that the information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this filing.

The bulk of our operations, which we refer to as “Exploration and Production” (“E&P”), are focused on the finding and development of natural gas and associated NGL and oil reserves. We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we refer to as “Marketing.”

Exploration and Production

Overview

Our primary business is the exploration and production of natural gas as well as associated NGLs and oil in our core positions in the Appalachia and Haynesville natural gas basins in the U.S. We are currently focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Louisiana. Our operations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio (herein referred to as “Appalachia”) are primarily focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and liquids reservoirs. Our operations in Louisiana (herein referred to as “Haynesville”) are primarily focused on the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas reservoirs.

•Our E&P segment recorded operating income of $2,583 million in 2021, compared to an operating loss of $2,864 million in 2020. Our operating loss in 2020 included $2,825 million of non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments. Excluding the impact of ceiling test impairments, operating income (loss) increased $2,622 million compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a 144% increase in our weighted average realized commodity prices, excluding derivatives, and a 41% increase in production volumes, of which 80% was related to the Montage Merger and the Indigo Merger (as defined herein).

•Our E&P segment cash flow from operations was $1,718 million in 2021, compared to $372 million in 2020. E&P segment cash flow from operations increased $1,346 million as a 30% increase in our net weighted average realized commodity prices, including settled derivatives, and a 41% increase in production volumes was only partially offset by a 46% increase in operating costs and expenses.

Oilfield Services Vertical Integration

We provide certain oilfield services that are strategic and economically beneficial for our E&P operations when our E&P activity levels and market pricing support these activities. This vertical integration lowers our well costs, dampens inflationary pressures, promotes operating efficiency, enables quick reaction to rapid changes in market conditions and helps to mitigate certain operational and environmental risks. These services include drilling, completions and water management and movement. As of December 31, 2021, we operated a fleet of drilling rigs and have leased a pressure pumping spread with a total capacity of 51,000 horsepower along with additional supporting pump down equipment with a total capacity of 36,000 horsepower. These assets provide us greater flexibility to align our operational activities with commodity prices. In 2021, we provided drilling rigs for 74 drilled wells.

Our Proved Reserves

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of pre-tax PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows (“standardized measure”), or after-tax PV-10 amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, pre-tax PV-10 is based on a pricing methodology and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, pre-tax PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the pre-tax PV-10 amount is the discounted amount of estimated future income taxes. See “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)” to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information about the calculation of standardized measure.

(2)Our existing tax attributes, including net operating losses and remaining depreciable tax basis related to our natural gas and oil properties, more than offset our future net operating income, resulting in no tax effect to our PV-10 calculation for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Our year-end 2021 reserve estimates totaled 21.1 Tcfe with an after-tax PV-10 of $18.7 billion. Our reserve estimates and the after-tax PV-10 measure, or standardized measure, are highly dependent upon the respective commodity price used in our reserve and after-tax PV-10 calculations.

•Our reserves increased 76% in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to the reserves acquired from Indigo and GEPH as well as an increase in commodity pricing.

•Our after-tax PV-10 value increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in the SEC 12-month backward-looking commodity prices as well as higher reserve levels resulting from the recent acquisitions.

•We are the designated operator of approximately 98% of our reserves, based on the pre-tax PV-10 value of our proved developed producing reserves, and our reserve life index was approximately 12.6 years at year-end 2021, using an estimate of full year production from our recently acquired Indigo and GEPH properties.

The difference in after-tax PV-10, or standardized measure, and pre-tax PV-10 (a non-GAAP measure which is reconciled in the 2021 Proved Reserves by Category and Summary Operating Data table below) is the discounted value of future income taxes on the estimated cash flows.

We believe that the pre-tax PV-10 value of the estimated cash flows related to our estimated proved reserves is a useful supplemental disclosure to the after-tax PV-10 value. Pre-tax PV-10 is based on prices, costs and discount factors that are comparable from company to company, while the after-tax PV-10 is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. We understand that securities analysts use pre-tax PV-10 as one measure of the value of a company’s current proved reserves and to compare relative values among peer companies without regard to income taxes. We refer you to “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a discussion of our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, to the risk factor “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report, and to “Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report for a discussion of the risks inherent in utilization of standardized measure and estimated reserve data.

Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices can reduce the value of our assets, both by a direct reduction in what the production could be sold for and by making some properties uneconomic, resulting in decreases to the overall value of our reserves and potential non-cash impairment charges to earnings. Further non-cash impairments in future periods could occur if the trailing 12-month commodity prices decrease as compared to the average used in prior periods.

The following table provides an overall and categorical summary of our natural gas, oil and NGL reserves, as of year-end 2021 based on average year prices, and our well count, net acreage and PV-10 as of December 31, 2021, and sets forth 2021 annual information related to production and capital investments for each of our operating areas:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other acreage consists primarily of properties in Colorado. 

(2)We have no reserves from synthetic gas, synthetic oil or nonrenewable natural resources intended to be upgraded into synthetic gas or oil. We used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methodologies in determining estimates of material properties, including performance and test date analysis, offset statistical analogy of performance data, volumetric evaluation, including analysis of petrophysical parameters (including porosity, net pay, fluid saturations (i.e., water, oil and gas) and permeability) in combination with estimated reservoir parameters (including reservoir temperature and pressure, formation depth and formation volume factors), geological analysis, including structure and isopach maps and seismic analysis, including review of 2-D and 3-D data to ascertain faults, closure and other factors.

(3)Other capital investments includes $5 million related to our water infrastructure project, $17 million related to our E&P service companies and $3 million related to other developmental activities.

(4)Excludes 884 wells in Appalachia and 191 wells in Haynesville in which we only have an overriding royalty interest. These wells were included in the December 31, 2021 reserves calculation.

(5)Excludes 30,744 net acres of minerals owned, of which 4,259 acres are leased by others. Minerals in Louisiana are subject to prescription beginning in 2024. The minerals underlying the Haynesville area are subject to expiration in 2027 if no drilling or production occurs on the associated acreage.

(6)Excludes exploration licenses for 2,518,519 net acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a moratorium since 2015. In 2021, we were granted a further extension of the licenses through March 2026. However, we cannot assure that the licenses will be extended past that date.

(7)Excludes 20,187 net acres of company-owned minerals.

(8)Pre-tax PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure. We believe that the presentation of pre-tax PV-10 is relevant and useful to our investors as supplemental disclosure to the standardized measure of discounted future cash flows (standardized measure), or after-tax PV-10 amount, because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes and our current tax structure. While the standardized measure is dependent on the unique tax situation of each company, pre-tax PV-10 is based on a pricing methodology and discount factors that are consistent for all companies. Because of this, pre-tax PV-10 can be used within the industry and by creditors and securities analysts to evaluate estimated net cash flows from proved reserves on a more comparable basis. The difference between the standardized measure and the pre-tax PV-10 amount is the discounted amount of estimated future income taxes. See “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures (Unaudited)” to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information about the calculation of standardized measure.

(9)Includes future asset retirement obligations outside of Appalachia and Haynesville.

(10)Based upon pre-tax PV-10 of proved developed producing activities.

Lease Expirations

The following table summarizes the leasehold acreage expiring over the next three years, assuming successful wells are not drilled to develop the acreage and leases are not extended:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)We have no reported proved undeveloped locations expiring in 2022.

(2)The leasehold acreage expiring includes 16,596 net acres in 2022, 6,914 net acres in 2023 and 6,350 net acres in 2024 can be extended for an average 5.0 years. 

(3)Exploration licenses were extended through March 2026 but have been subject to a moratorium since 2015. We fully impaired our investment in New Brunswick in 2016.

We refer you to “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves as well as our standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows related to our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves. We also refer you to the risk factor “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

Presented below is a summary of changes in our proved undeveloped reserves for 2020 and 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Primarily due to changes associated with the analysis of updated data collected in the year.

Performance, production and price revisions consist of revisions to reserves associated with wells having proved reserves in existence as of the beginning of the year. Extensions, discoveries and other additions include new reserves locations added in the current year.

•As of December 31, 2021, we had 9,813 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves, all of which we expect will be developed within five years of the initial disclosure as the starting reference date. During 2021, we invested $388 million in connection with converting 1,153 Bcfe, or 30%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2020 into proved developed reserves and added 3,511 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. Additionally, we added 3,692 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves through the Indigo Merger and GEPH Merger. These additions were partially offset by a 24 Bcfe net decrease due to price, performance and production revisions.

•As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,787 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. During 2020, we invested $674 million in connection with converting 1,487 Bcfe, or 24%, of our proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2019 into proved developed reserves and added 474 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves. As a result of the commodity price environment in 2020, we had downward price revisions of 3,288 Bcfe. These reductions were partially offset by a 567 Bcfe increase due to performance and production revisions.

•Our proved reserves as of December 31, 2021 included no proved undeveloped reserves that had a positive present value on an undiscounted basis in compliance with proved reserve requirements but did not have a positive present value when discounted at 10%.

We expect that the development costs for our proved undeveloped reserves of 9,813 Bcfe as of December 31, 2021 will require us to invest an additional $5.6 billion for those reserves to be brought to production. Our ability to make the necessary investments to generate these cash inflows is subject to factors that may be beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors “Natural gas, oil and NGL prices greatly affect our revenues and thus profits, liquidity, growth, ability to repay our debt and the value of our assets” and “Significant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates 

Our proved reserve estimates as of December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021 included in this Annual Report were prepared by our internal reservoir engineers under the supervision of our management, in accordance with petroleum engineering and evaluation standards published by the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and definitions and guidelines established by the SEC. These proved reserve estimates have been audited by our independent engineers, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”).

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements 

Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team for that property. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers, who are not part of the asset management teams, and by our Director of Reserves, who is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Director of Reserves has more than 27 years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the estimation of natural gas and oil reserves, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining us in 2018, our Director of Reserves served in various reservoir engineering roles for EP Energy Company, El Paso Corporation, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, Schlumberger and H.J. Gruy & Associates, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who has more than 33 years of experience in petroleum engineering including the estimation of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves in multiple basins in the United States, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining Southwestern in 2017, our Chief Operating Officer served in various engineering and leadership roles for EP Energy Corporation, El Paso Corporation, ARCO Oil and Gas Company, Burlington Resources and Peoples Energy Production, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

We engage NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-002699. Within NSAI, the two technical persons primarily responsible for auditing our proved reserves estimates (1) have over 24 years and over 20 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and petroleum engineering, respectively; (2) have over 13 years and over 20 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, respectively; (3) each has a college degree; (4) each is a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas or a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas; (5) each meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; and (6) each is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. The financial data included in the reserve estimates is also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Our proved reserves estimates, as internally reviewed and audited by NSAI, are submitted for review and approval to our President and Chief Executive Officer. Finally, upon his approval, NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors, with whom final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests. A copy of NSAI’s report has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.

Our Reserve Replacement

The reserve replacement ratio measures the success of an E&P company in adding new reserves to replace the reserves that are being depleted by its current production volumes. We believe the reserve replacement ratio is an important analytical measure used by investors and peers in the E&P industry to evaluate performance results and long-term prospects. Reserve replacement represents the net change in reserves, net of production, divided by our current year production, as shown in our supplemental reserve table disclosures. The reserve replacement ratio is a statistical indicator that has limitations, including its predictive and comparative value. As an annual measure, the reserve replacement ratio can be limited because it may vary widely based on the extent and timing of new discoveries and the varying effects of changes in prices and well performance. In addition, because the reserve replacement ratio does not consider the cost or timing of future production of new reserves or the type of reserves, such measure may not be an adequate measure of value creation.

Excluding the Haynesville acquisitions, we organically replaced 382% of our production volumes in 2021 with 4,231 Bcfe of proved reserve additions and performance revisions. Our recently acquired properties in the Haynesville separately accounted for 61% of the increase in total reserves in 2021, as compared to the prior year. The following table summarizes the changes in our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves for the year ended December 31, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other reserves and acreage consists primarily of properties in Colorado.

Our ability to add reserves depends upon many factors that are beyond our control. We refer you to the risk factors “Significant capital investment is required to replace our reserves and conduct our business” and “If we are not able to replace reserves, our production levels and thus our revenues and profits may decline.” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report and to “Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements” in this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these factors and other risks.

Our Operations

Appalachia

Appalachia represented 89% of our total 2021 net production and 73% of our total reserves as of December 31, 2021. Given that we began operating in the Haynesville in the latter part of 2021 as a result of the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger, we expect the percentage of production represented by our operations in Appalachia to decrease in 2022. In 2021, our production increased by 228 Bcfe. Our reserves in Appalachia increased by 3,538 Bcf, as net additions of 3,962 Bcfe, net upward price revisions of 415 Bcfe and net upward performance revisions of 270 Bcfe were only partially offset by production of 1,108 Bcfe. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 768,050 net acres in Appalachia and had a total of 1,527 wells on production that we operated. Below is a summary of Appalachia’s operating results for the latest two years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2021 had an average royalty interest of 14.75%.

(2)Excludes 884 and 686 wells as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(3)Excludes 16 and 54 wells as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(4)Excludes $5 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to water infrastructure.

(5)Average completed well cost and average lateral length for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 include wells in the Marcellus and Utica formations.

19

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements 

For 2021 as compared to 2020:

•Our average completed well cost per foot decreased primarily due to increased lateral lengths and improved operational execution.

Our ability to bring our Appalachia production to market depends on a number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. We refer you to “Marketing” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of our gathering and transportation arrangements for Appalachia production.

Haynesville

On September 1, 2021, we acquired our initial Haynesville properties through the Indigo Merger. Our Haynesville production volumes reflect four months of production from these properties. On December 31, 2021, we acquired additional Haynesville properties through our GEPH Merger. Our reported Haynesville reserves as of December 31, 2021 reflects this addition. Haynesville represented 11% of our total 2021 net production and 27% of our total reserves as of December 31, 2021. Given that we began operating in the Haynesville in the latter part of 2021 as a result of these mergers, we expect the percentage of production represented by our operations in the Haynesville to increase in 2022. In 2021, our production in Haynesville was 132 Bcfe. Our reserves in Haynesville were 5,621 Bcfe as of December 31, 2021, as the acquisition of 5,753 Bcfe in 2021 was only partially offset by production of 132 Bcfe. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 256,727 net acres in Haynesville and had a total of 761 wells on production that we operated. Below is a summary of our Haynesville operating results for 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Our undeveloped acreage position as of December 31, 2021 had an average royalty interest of 22%.

(2)Excludes 191 as of December 31, 2021 in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(3)Excludes 17 wells as of December 31, 2021 in which we have only an overriding royalty interest.

(4)Average completed well cost and average lateral length for wells placed to sales following the Indigo Merger on September 1, 2021 includes wells drilled and completed by previous operator. The GEPH Merger closed on December 31, 2021, and no wells acquired from GEPH were placed to sales in 2021.

Our continued ability to bring our Haynesville production to market will depend on a number of factors including the construction of and/or the availability of capacity on gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. We refer you to “Marketing” within Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of our gathering and transportation arrangements for Haynesville production.

Other

Excluding 2,518,519 acres in New Brunswick, Canada, which have been subject to a government-imposed drilling moratorium since 2015, we held 650 net undeveloped acres for the potential development of new resources as of December 31, 2021 in areas outside of Appalachia and Haynesville. This compares to 9,764 net undeveloped acres held at year-end 2020 in areas outside of Appalachia and Haynesville, excluding the New Brunswick acreage.

New Brunswick, Canada. We currently hold exclusive licenses to search and conduct an exploration program covering 2,518,519 net acres in New Brunswick. In 2015, the provincial government in New Brunswick imposed a moratorium on hydraulic fracturing until it is satisfied with a list of conditions. In response to this moratorium, we were granted an extension of the licenses to March 2021. In May 2016, the provincial government announced that the moratorium would continue indefinitely. Given this development, we fully impaired our investment in New Brunswick in 2016. In 2021, we were granted a further extension of the licenses through March 2026. Unless and until the moratorium is lifted, we will not be able to develop these assets.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

In November 2020, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger with Montage Resources Corporation (“Montage”), pursuant to which Montage merged with and into Southwestern (the “Montage Merger”). At the effective time of the Montage Merger, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of common stock in Montage in exchange for 1.8656 shares of our common stock per share of Montage common stock. The Montage Merger increased our footprint in West Virginia and Pennsylvania and expanded our operations into Ohio.

On September 1, 2021, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ikon Acquisition Company, LLC (“Ikon”), Indigo Natural Resources LLC (“Indigo”) and Ibis Unitholder Representative LLC, pursuant to which Indigo merged with and into Ikon, a subsidiary of Southwestern, and became a subsidiary of Southwestern (the “Indigo Merger”). The outstanding equity interests in Indigo were cancelled and converted into the right to receive (i) $373 million in cash consideration, and (ii) 337,827,171 shares of Southwestern common stock. Additionally, we assumed $700 million in aggregate principal amount of Indigo’s 5.375% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Indigo Notes”). The shares of Southwestern common stock had an aggregate dollar value equal to $1,588 million, based on the closing price of $4.70 per share of Southwestern common stock on the NYSE on September 1, 2021. The Indigo Merger diversified our operations by expanding our portfolio into the Haynesville and Bossier formations, deepened our inventory of economic wells, reduced our enterprise risk profile and gave us additional exposure to the LNG and other markets on the U.S. Gulf Coast.

On December 31, 2021, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger with GEP Haynesville, LLC (“GEPH”), pursuant to which we acquired GEPH for aggregate consideration of approximately $1,732 million, consisting of a combination of $1,269 million cash and 99,337,748 shares of our common stock, with GEPH becoming our wholly owned subsidiary (the “GEPH Merger” and, together with the Montage Merger and the Indigo Merger, the “Mergers”). The shares issued as consideration had an aggregate dollar value equal to approximately $463 million based on the closing price of $4.66 per share of Southwestern common stock on the NYSE on December 31, 2021. The GEPH Merger furthered the benefits of the Indigo Merger and enhanced our scale and operating and marketing optionality in the Haynesville.

Sales, Delivery Commitments and Customers

Sales. The following tables present historical information about our production volumes for natural gas, oil and NGLs and our average realized natural gas, oil and NGL sales prices:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The increase in production volumes in 2021 resulted primarily from a 228 Bcfe increase in net production in Appalachia and 132 Bcf of production from our recently-acquired Haynesville properties. Production for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included 185 Bcfe and 28 Bcfe, respectively, from our acreage acquired through the Montage Merger.

Sales of natural gas, oil and NGL production are conducted under contracts that reflect current prices and are subject to seasonal price swings. We are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for these commodities, including changes that may be induced by the effects of weather on demand for our production. We regularly enter into various derivative and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected production to support certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of adverse price movements. We limit derivative agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings, and our policies prohibit speculation.

As of December 31, 2021, we had the following commodity price derivatives in place on our targeted future production:

As of February 25, 2022, we had the following commodity price derivatives in place on our targeted 2022 and future production:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We intend to use derivatives to limit the impact of adverse price movements on a large portion of expected future production volumes to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow. We refer you to Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” for further information regarding our derivatives and risk management as of December 31, 2021.

During 2021, the average price we received for our natural gas production, excluding the impact of derivatives and including the cost of transportation, was approximately $0.53 per Mcf lower than average NYMEX prices, an improvement of 28% over the prior year differential. Differences between NYMEX and price realized (basis differentials) are due primarily to locational differences and transportation cost. 

The tables below present the amount of our future natural gas production in which the impact of basis volatility has been limited through derivatives and physical sales arrangements as of December 31, 2021:

We refer you to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities.

Delivery Commitments. As of December 31, 2021, we had natural gas delivery commitments of 1,224 Bcf in 2022 and 730 Bcf in 2023 under existing agreements. These amounts are well below our expected 2022 natural gas production from Appalachia and Haynesville and expected 2023 production from our available reserves, which are not subject to any priorities or curtailments that may affect quantities delivered to our customers or any priority allocations or price limitations imposed by federal or state regulatory agencies, or any other factors beyond our control that may affect our ability to meet our delivery commitments other than those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part I of this Annual Report. We expect to be able to fulfill all of our short-term and long-term delivery commitments to provide natural gas from our own production of available reserves; however, if we are unable to do so, we may have to purchase natural gas at market to fulfill our obligations.

Customers. Our E&P production is marketed primarily by our Marketing segment. Our customers include LNG exporters, major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one purchaser accounted for 12% of our revenues. If we had completed the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger at the beginning of 2021, this same purchaser would have accounted for approximately 16% of our revenues. A default or operational disruption on this account could have a material impact on the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one purchaser accounted for 10% of our revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.

Competition

All phases of the natural gas and associated liquids industry are highly competitive. We compete in the acquisition and disposition of properties, the search for and development of reserves, the production and marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs, and the securing of labor, services and equipment required to conduct our operations. Our competitors include major oil and natural gas companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers. Many of these competitors have financial and other resources that substantially exceed those available to us. Consequently, we will encounter competition that may affect both the price we receive and contract terms we must offer. We also face competition in accessing pipeline and other services to transport our product to market. Likewise, there are substitutes for the commodities we produce, such as other fuels for power generation, heating and transportation, and those markets in effect compete with us.

We cannot predict whether and to what extent any regulatory changes initiated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or the FERC, or any other new energy legislation or regulations will achieve the goal of increasing competition, lessening preferential treatment and enhancing transparency in markets in which our natural gas production is sold. Similarly, we cannot predict whether legal constraints that have hindered the development of new transportation infrastructure, particularly in the northeastern United States, will continue. However, we do not believe that we will be disproportionately affected as compared to other natural gas and oil producers and marketers by any action taken by the FERC or any other legislative or regulatory body or the status of the development of transportation facilities.

Regulation

Producing natural gas, oil and NGL resources and transporting and selling production historically have been heavily regulated. For example, state governments regulate the location of wells and establish the minimum size for spacing units. Permits typically are required before drilling. State and local government zoning and land use regulations may also limit the locations for drilling and production. Similar regulations can also affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market. Regulations additionally govern the handling, transport and disposal of the water involved in our development efforts. In addition, various suppliers of goods and services may require licensing.

Currently in the United States, the price at which natural gas, oil or NGLs may be sold is not regulated. Congress has imposed price regulation from time to time, and there can be no assurance that the current, less stringent regulatory approach will continue. In 2015, the federal government repealed a 40-year ban on the export of crude oil. The export of natural gas continues to require federal permits. Broader freedom to export could lead to higher prices. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and the rules that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, (the “CFTC”), the SEC, and certain other regulators have issued thereunder regulate certain swaps, futures and options contracts in the major energy markets, including for natural gas, oil and NGLs.

Producing and transporting natural gas, oil and NGLs is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

Marketing

We engage in marketing activities which primarily support our E&P operations and generate revenue through the marketing of natural gas, oil and NGLs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Marketing operating income increased $59 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to a $56 million increase in the marketing margin, as well as a $1 million increase in gas storage gains and $2 million in non-performance damages received, both recorded in other operating revenues.

•Marketing revenues increased in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to a 113% increase in the price received for volumes marketed and a 404 Bcfe increase in marketed volumes.

•The margin generated from marketing activities increased $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a 36% increase in volumes marketed and a corresponding reduction in third-party purchases and sales, which were used in 2020 to optimize our transportation folio, due to increased affiliated volumes available for marketing.

Marketing

We attempt to capture opportunities related to the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs primarily involving the marketing of our own equity production and that of royalty owners in our wells. Additionally, we manage portfolio and locational, or basis, risk, acquire transportation rights on third-party pipelines and, in limited circumstances, purchase third-party natural gas to fulfill commitments specific to a geographic location.

Appalachia. Our transportation portfolio for all products in Appalachia is highly diversified, allows us to capitalize on strengthening markets, including city-gate markets, and provides production flow assurance. Agreements with Rover Pipeline LLC and Mountaineer Xpress / Gulf Xpress pipelines allow us to access growing high-demand markets in the U.S. Gulf Coast region while low-cost transportation on other northeast pipelines allows us to capture in-basin pricing, and our agreements with Rover Pipeline LLC and Rockies Express Pipeline LLC provide access to Midwest markets. In addition to our natural gas transportation, we have ethane take-away capacity that provides direct access to Mont Belvieu pricing. Certain of our capacity agreements contain multiple extension and reduction options that allow us to right-size our transportation portfolio as needed for our production or to capture future market opportunities. The table below details our firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 25, 2022:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)We have extension options and potential contract renewal capacity of 120,000 MMBtu per day for 2023 and 160,000 MMBtu per day for 2024 for Appalachia.

Haynesville. Our transportation portfolio for Haynesville allows for access to the U.S. Gulf Coast and LNG corridor markets. Agreements with ETC Tiger, Gulf South and Enable Line CP provide transport to the Southeast Supply Header (“SESH”) and Perryville Hub, a central trading location with high demand and amply liquidity, while Acadian, Midcoast and LEAP pipelines deliver to the growing LNG corridor, with direct access to LNG shippers at sales prices close to Henry Hub pricing. Our diversified transportation portfolio provides flow optionality and allows for advantageous pricing year-round as the Haynesville

maintains stability in basis throughout the year. The table below details our natural gas firm transportation, firm sales and total takeaway capacity over the next three years as of February 25, 2022:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Demand Charges

As of December 31, 2021, our obligations for demand and similar charges under the firm transportation agreements and gathering agreements totaled approximately $10.5 billion, $872 million of which related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and additional construction efforts. We also have guarantee obligations of up to $869 million of that amount. We regularly monitor our proved reserves to ensure sufficient availability to fully utilize our firm transportation commitments.

In the first quarter of 2019, we agreed to purchase firm transportation with pipelines in Appalachia starting in 2021 and running through 2032 totaling $327 million in total remaining contractual commitments, of which the seller has agreed to reimburse us for $100 million.

We refer you to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details on our demand charges and the risk factor “Our business depends on access to natural gas, oil and NGL gathering, processing and transportation systems and facilities. Changes to access and cost of these systems and facilities could adversely impact our business and financial condition. Our commitments to assure availability of transportation could lead to substantial payments for capacity we do not use if production falls below projected levels,” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

Competition

Our marketing activities compete with numerous other companies offering the same services, many of which possess larger financial and other resources than we have. Some of these competitors are other producers and affiliates of companies with extensive pipeline systems that are used for transportation from producers to end users. Other factors affecting competition are the cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand and the cost of and proximity to pipelines and other transportation facilities. We believe that our ability to compete effectively within the marketing segment in the future depends upon establishing and maintaining strong relationships with customers.

Customers

Our marketing customers include LNG exporters, major energy companies, utilities and industrial purchasers of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one purchaser accounted for 12% of our revenues. If we had completed the Indigo Merger and the GEPH Merger at the beginning of 2021, this same purchaser would have accounted for approximately 16% of our revenues. A default or operational disruption on this account could have a material impact on the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one purchaser accounted for 10% of our revenues. No other purchasers accounted for more than 10% of consolidated revenues.

Regulation

The transportation of natural gas, oil and NGLs is heavily regulated. FERC regulates the rates and the terms and conditions of transportation service provided by interstate natural gas, crude oil and NGL pipelines. State governments typically must authorize the construction of pipelines for intrastate service. Moreover, the rates charged for intrastate transportation by pipeline are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Currently, all pipelines we own are intrastate and immaterial to our operations.

State and local permitting, zoning and land use regulations can affect the location, construction and operation of gathering and other pipelines needed to transport production to market, and the lack of new pipeline capacity can limit our ability to reach relevant markets for the sale of the commodities we produce.

The transportation of natural gas and oil is also subject to extensive environmental regulation. We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part I of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or

feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

Other

We currently have no significant business activity outside of our E&P and Marketing segments.

Environmental Regulation

General. Our operations are subject to laws and regulations governing protection of the environment and natural resources in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations require permits for drilling wells and the maintenance of bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, and also regulate the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. We maintain insurance for clean-up costs in limited instances arising out of sudden and accidental events, but otherwise we may not be fully insured against all such risks. Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Certain laws and legal principles can make us liable for environmental damage to properties we previously owned, and, although we generally require purchasers to assume that liability, there is no assurance that they will have sufficient funds should a liability arise. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes may result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal or cleanup requirements. We do not expect continued compliance with existing requirements to have a material adverse impact on us, but there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future. We refer you to “Other – Environmental Regulation” in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Annual Report and the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report for a discussion of the impact of environmental regulation on our business.

The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental and worker health and safety laws and regulations to which we are subject.

Generation and Disposal of Wastes.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended, also known as CERCLA or the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of a site where the release occurred, as well as persons that transported or disposed, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.” However, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been considered from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. If such measures were enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste.

The Clean Water Act, as amended, or CWA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other natural gas and oil waste into regulated waters. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants to regulated waters and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. The CWA and similar state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of pollutants and unauthorized discharges of reportable quantities of oil and other hazardous substances. The EPA has adopted regulations requiring certain natural gas and oil exploration and production facilities to obtain permits for storm water discharges. Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans.

Index to Financial Statements 

The Oil Pollution Act, as amended, or OPA, and regulations promulgated thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills into regulated waters. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill. Oil accounted for 3% of our total production in 2021 and 4% in 2020 and 2019.

We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration for and production of natural gas and oil. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us and/or on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. Under CERCLA, the CWA, RCRA and analogous state laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.

Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act, as amended, restricts emissions into the atmosphere. Various activities we conduct as part of our operations, such as drilling, pumping and the use of vehicles, can result in emissions to the environment. We must obtain permits, typically from local authorities, to conduct various regulated activities. Federal and state governmental agencies are taking steps to regulate methane and other emissions from oil and natural gas activities, and further regulation could increase our costs or restrict our ability to produce. For example, on November 15, 2021, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposed rule under the Clean Air Act’s New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”), known as Subpart OOOOa, which is intended to reduce methane emissions from new and existing oil and gas sources. The proposed rule would make the existing regulations in Subpart OOOOa more stringent and create a Subpart OOOOb to expand reduction requirements for new, modified, and reconstructed oil and gas sources, including standards focusing on certain source types that have never been regulated under the CAA (including intermittent vent pneumatic controllers, associated gas, and liquids unloading facilities). In addition, the proposed rule would establish “Emissions Guidelines,” creating a Subpart OOOOc that would require states to develop plans to reduce methane emissions from existing sources that must be at least as effective as presumptive standards set by the EPA. Under the proposed rule, states would have three years to develop their compliance plan for existing sources and the regulations for new sources would take effect immediately upon issuance of a final rule. The EPA is expected to issue both a supplemental proposed rule, that may expand or modify the current proposed rule, and final rule by the end of 2022. In addition, although methane emissions are not currently regulated at the federal level, we are required to report emissions of various greenhouse gases, including methane.

Threatened and Endangered Species. The Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection of threatened and endangered species may have the effect of prohibiting or delaying us from obtaining drilling and other permits and may include restrictions on road building and other activities in areas containing the affected species or their habitats. Based on the species that have been identified and listed to date, we do not believe there are any species protected under the Endangered Species Act that would materially and adversely affect our operations at this time.

Hydraulic Fracturing. We utilize hydraulic fracturing in drilling wells as a means of maximizing their productivity. It is an essential and common practice in the oil and gas industry used to stimulate the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids from dense and deep rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves using water, sand, and certain chemicals to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation to allow the flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore.

In the past several years, there has been an increased focus on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, both in the United States and abroad. In the United States, hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but federal agencies have started to assert regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. In addition to the EPA’s Subpart OOOO regulations discussed above, the EPA finalized pretreatment standards that prohibit the indirect discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned treatment works. Based on our current operations and practices, management believes such rules will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view may change in the future.

29

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements 

In addition, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. A number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing. For example, the EPA released a report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations.

Some states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, public disclosure, waste disposal and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations or otherwise seek to ban fracturing activities altogether. In addition to state laws, local land use restrictions, such as city ordinances, may restrict or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general and/or hydraulic fracturing in particular. In the event state, local, or municipal legal restrictions are adopted in areas where we are currently conducting, or in the future plan to conduct, operations, we may incur additional costs to comply with such requirements that may be significant in nature, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from the drilling and/or completion of wells.

Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process has led to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and gas production activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques. Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil, natural gas, and associated liquids including from the development of shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing. The adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs and time, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, various officials and candidates at the federal, state and local levels, including past presidential candidates, have proposed banning hydraulic fracturing altogether. We refer you to the risk factor “We, our service providers and our customers are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities” in Item 1A of Part I of this Annual Report.

In addition, concerns have been raised about the potential for seismic activity to occur from the use of underground injection control wells, a predominant method for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities. New rules and regulations may be developed to address these concerns, possibly limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations and increasing the cost of disposal in others. We utilize third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. These third parties may operate injection wells and may be subject to regulatory restrictions relating to seismicity, which could result in increased costs for their services to dispose of waste water from our operations. 

Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Climate Change. In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their greenhouse gas emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established on a case-by case basis. One of our subsidiaries operates compressor stations, which are facilities that are required to adhere to the PSD or Title V permit requirements. EPA rulemakings related to greenhouse gas emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources.

The EPA also has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include certain of our operations. Although Congress from time to time has considered legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. However, the United States House of Representatives passed H.R. 5376, known as the Build Back Better Act on November 3, 2021. The House version of the bill targets methane emissions from oil and gas sources by proposing to implement fees for excess methane leaking from wells, storage sites and pipelines as well as fees for new producing and non-producing oil and gas leases and offshore pipelines. The United States Senate did not pass the House version of the Build Back Better Act, and it is unclear whether any portions of the bill will become law. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of states, including states in which we operate, have enacted or passed measures to track and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and regional greenhouse gas cap-and-trade 

30

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements 

programs. Most of these cap-and-trade programs require major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances, with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall greenhouse gas emission reduction goal is achieved. These reductions may cause the cost of allowances to escalate significantly over time.

The adoption and implementation of regulations that require reporting of greenhouse gases or otherwise limit emissions of greenhouse gases from our equipment and operations could require us to incur increased operating costs, including costs to monitor and report on greenhouse gas emissions, install new equipment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. In addition, these regulatory initiatives could drive down demand for our products, stimulating demand for alternative forms of energy that do not rely on combustion of fossil fuels that serve as a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. While some new laws and regulations are prompting power producers to shift from coal to natural gas, which has a positive effect on demand, regulatory incentives or requirements to conserve energy, use alternative sources or reduce greenhouse gas emissions in product supply chains could reduce demand for the products we produce.

In December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions (the “Paris Agreement”). The Paris Agreement entered into effect in November 2016 after more than 70 nations, including the United States, ratified or otherwise indicated their intent to be bound by the agreement. On June 1, 2017, the prior administration announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which withdrawal became effective on November 4, 2020. However, on January 20, 2021, the current administration issued written notification to the United Nations of the United States’ intention to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which became effective on February 19, 2021. In addition, in September 2021, the current administration publicly announced the Global Methane Pledge, a pact that aims to reduce global methane emissions at least 30% below 2020 levels by 2030. Since its formal launch at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (“COP26”), over 100 countries have joined the pledge. To the extent that the United States and other countries implement or impose climate change regulations on the oil and gas industry, it could have an adverse effect on our business.

The Company is committed to responsible energy development, and we recognize stakeholder concerns about climate change. We also understand that regulations and practices aimed at protecting the environment, and specifically reducing greenhouse gas emissions, can affect our business. We consider addressing these issues as part of our risk management process. We have published a climate change scenario analysis as a part of our 2021 Corporate Responsibility Report (which covers the year 2020 and is not incorporated by reference into this filing). This report and our corporate responsibility reporting is informed by recommendations from the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures framework.

Employee Health and Safety. Our operations are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or OSHA, and comparable state statutes, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens.

Canada. Our activities in Canada have, to date, been limited to certain geological and geophysical activities and now are subject to a moratorium. If and when the moratorium ends and should we begin drilling and development activities in New Brunswick, we will be subject to Canadian federal, provincial and local environmental regulations.

Human Capital

We aim to provide a safe, healthy, respectful and fair workplace for all employees. We focus our actions to ensure our people are engaged and have the tools and skills to work safely and to be successful. 

Workplace Culture/Respect, Diversity, and Inclusion.  Southwestern Energy is committed to respect in the workplace.

organizations, working to build a diverse and local talent pool by encouraging diversity in science, technology, engineering and math education. We intend to continue to support and expand diversity initiatives within our organization.

Our Human Rights Policy, which is consistent with the International Labour Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, underscores our commitment to our workforce and extends to vendors and contractors. 

Employee Engagement. Our human capital management objectives include identifying, recruiting, training, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. Our employee development programs aim to provide Company employees with the right tools, training and resources to be successful. We offer a range of development solutions targeted at meeting individual employees’ needs, including technical and non-technical training programs. We also measure employee engagement and enablement through a bi-annual survey, which is administered by a third-party vendor, and then create and implement an action plan based on feedback from the survey.

We aim to offer and maintain market competitive compensation and benefit programs for all of our employees in order to attract and retain superior and diverse talent. Compensation is based on several primary factors, including performance, skills, years of experience, time in position and market data.

Employee Health and Safety. Southwestern Energy leaders, including senior management, are evaluated in part on and held accountable for the HSE performance of their teams. HSE considerations are important factors in our business decisions, and we work to foster a true “ONE Team” culture, where our employees and contractors work together to uphold the same high safety standards.

Our response to COVID-19 throughout the pandemic has been driven by our long-standing commitment to safety. We formed a cross-functional Incident Response Team (“IRT”) in March 2020 to manage and oversee prolonged company-wide response and mitigation efforts. The IRT continues to meet at least weekly and advise senior management. Our employees and contractors remain subject to increased safeguards, including mask requirements, social distancing, isolation and quarantine procedures, dynamic office closures and remote work protocols, rapid cleaning response protocols, temperature screenings at office locations and modified protocols as necessary based on continuous monitoring of relevant data and guidance. We have also provided additional benefits to our employees, which include making the COVID-19 vaccine available to employees and their families who want it, COVID-19 testing for all office and field employees and their families and paid time off for non-exempt workers required to isolate or quarantine, and we continue to recommend that our employees receive COVID-19 booster vaccinations.

As of December 31, 2021, we had 938 total employees, a 4% increase compared to year-end 2020. None of our employees were covered by a collective bargaining agreement at year-end 2021. We believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
