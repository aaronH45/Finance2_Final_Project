ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Business Overview

What We Do

Citrix is an enterprise software company focused on helping organizations deliver a consistent and secure work experience no matter where work needs to get done — in the office, at home, or in the field. We do this by delivering a digital workspace solution that provides unified, reliable and secure access to all work resources (apps, content, etc.) and simplifies work execution and collaboration across every work channel, device, and location. Our Workspace solutions are complemented by our general work solutions, such as content collaboration and collaborative work management solutions, and our App Delivery and Security solutions, which deliver the applications and data employees need across any network with security, reliability and speed. 

Citrix believes that work is not a place —work is about business outcomes. We have helped organizations with digital transformation for many years. The challenges and complexities created by the proliferation of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)-based applications and the emergence of hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure environments are now combined with the realities brought upon by the global COVID-19 pandemic—realities such as long-term remote and flexible work models and an increased need for risk mitigation and business continuity. 

As a result, we believe organizations are accelerating their cloud and IT modernization plans to better position themselves to address these new challenges and embrace the opportunity that may arise from empowering secure, distributed, and more productive work for their teams. To do this, organizations may rely on Citrix solutions for business agility, employee productivity, security and compliance, as well as cost and efficiency. Citrix solutions are focused on employee empowerment and are designed to provide end-users with the simplicity of a common user experience while ensuring information technology, or IT, administrators are able to deliver applications and data with the security and controls necessary to protect the enterprise and its customers.

Our Business Transformation

Citrix's business continues to evolve in the following ways:

•Perpetual to Subscription: Our business model has shifted away from selling perpetual licenses towards subscription, or recurring contracts in the form of SaaS, on-premise term, and consumption-based agreements; and

•On-Premise to Cloud: As the share of applications and data continues to move rapidly from on-premise data centers to the cloud, our product development and engineering resources have increasingly focused on delivering cloud-based solutions.

Citrix was incorporated in Delaware on April 17, 1989. 

Agreement and Plan of Merger

On January 31, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Picard Parent, Inc., or Parent, Picard Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, or Merger Sub, and, for certain limited purposes detailed in the Merger Agreement, TIBCO Software, Inc., or TIBCO, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Citrix, with Citrix as the surviving corporation (we refer to this transaction as the Merger). Parent and Merger Sub were formed by TIBCO, an indirect subsidiary of an affiliate of Vista Equity Partners, or Vista, a leading global investment firm focused exclusively on enterprise software, data and technology-enabled businesses. Vista is partnering with Evergreen Coast Capital Corp., an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management L.P. that focuses on making investments exclusively in technology and technology-enabled services businesses, to acquire Citrix in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $16.5 billion, including the assumption of Citrix debt. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, upon the closing of the Merger, our stockholders will receive $104.00 in cash per share. The Merger is expected to close mid-year 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of the Merger Agreement by our stockholders and receipt of regulatory approvals. Upon completion of the Merger, our shares of common stock will no longer trade on the Nasdaq, and Citrix will become a private company.

Solutions and Services

We offer digital workspace solutions and services that enable companies to deliver hybrid work by providing consistent, secure and reliable access to the systems and information employees need to do their best work, no matter where work needs to get done — in the office, at home, or in the field. Our offerings empower organizations to accelerate business performance by harnessing technology to enhance employee engagement, boost productivity, and drive innovation.

Workspace

The Citrix Workspace platform supports today’s remote and hybrid work environment with a broad range of features and functionalities that tie together the myriad of applications that reside within enterprises. Citrix Workspace provides secure access to employees, helps minimize distractions and improve focus, enabling them to do their best work, elevating employee productivity and employee engagement, and improving an enterprise’s security profile. Citrix Workspace delivers a unified, secure and intelligent workspace with single sign-on access to all the applications and content employees use in one unified platform. Citrix Workspace enables IT administrators to proactively manage security threats in complex, distributed, hybrid, multi-cloud and multi-device environments, and it empowers IT administrators to deliver applications to end users more securely than operating them natively. Intelligent analytics and user behavior insights are derived to enable enhanced security, management, orchestration, and automation of workspaces and application delivery.

 Citrix Workspace comes with ready integrations with widely-used business applications, including Salesforce, Workday, SAP Ariba and SAP Concur, ServiceNow, Microsoft Outlook and Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and is compatible with identity and access management providers, including Okta, Ping, Radius, and GoogleID. Citrix Workspace can be delivered in public cloud infrastructure, on-premise, running in a customers’ datacenter, or in hybrid deployment models. Pricing for the Citrix Workspace platform is tiered based on the level of functionalities provided. 

Capabilities offered as part of the platform include: 

•Citrix Workspace - delivers an intelligent experience that customizes and streamlines user workflows by enabling organizations to organize, guide and automate work, tasks and functions, and allows end users to perform actions across various applications directly within the Citrix Workspace.

•Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops - gives employees the freedom to work anywhere on any device while cutting IT costs and securely delivering Windows, Linux, Web and SaaS apps, and full virtual desktops. Services are available as a turnkey desktop-as-a-service solution running on a range of public cloud platforms including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (“GCP”) to a host of other deployment options, including hybrid, or on-premise.

•Citrix Analytics for Security - continuously assesses the behavior of Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops users and Citrix Workspace users and applies actions to protect sensitive corporate information. The aggregation and correlation of data across networks, virtualized applications and desktops, and content collaboration tools enables the generation of valuable insights and more focused actions to address user security threats. 

•Citrix Analytics for Performance - uses machine learning to quantify user experience, providing end-to-end visibility and enabling capacity planning and proactive response to performance degradation.

•Citrix Content Collaboration - provides a secure, cloud-based file sharing, digital transaction and storage solution built to give users enterprise-class data services across all corporate and personal devices.

•Citrix Secure Workspace Access - provides an end-to-end solution to implement Zero Trust principles (i.e., required verification of all users whether inside or outside of a network), avoiding the gaps left from relying on assorted point solutions. It reduces the attack surface by protecting the user and the apps inside the workspace, where work actually gets done.

•Citrix Secure Internet Access - provides a solution that protects direct internet access for branch and remote workers using unsanctioned apps. 

•Collaborative Work Management - removes workplace complexities by providing a single source of truth for people, teams, and organizations to collaborate and perform at their best. It is an intelligent and versatile work management platform that can be easily configured for any use case to put teams in control of their digital workflows, enabling them to focus on the most important work, maximize potential, and accelerate business growth.

Customers 

Our customers are businesses of all sizes and include the largest enterprises and institutions in the world spanning every major industry vertical, including healthcare, financial services, technology, manufacturing, consumer, and government agencies. Our largest customers are often our longest tenured customers.

Technology Relationships

We have a number of technology relationships in place to accelerate the delivery of secure hybrid work. These relationships include cross-licensing, original equipment manufacturer (OEM), resell, joint reference architectures, and other arrangements that result in integrated solutions that enable our customers to accelerate their IT modernization, enable secure distributed work and boost worker productivity and engagement.

Microsoft

For over 30 years, Citrix and Microsoft have maintained a strategic partnership spanning product development, go-to-market initiatives and partner development, enabling our mutual customers’ secure, high-performance delivery of applications, desktops and data to their employees. Together, Citrix and Microsoft offer solutions and services that aid and accelerate the transition from on-premise IT infrastructure and practices to emerging hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud delivery models.

Together, Citrix and Microsoft enable a consistent and optimal flexible work experience. These joint solutions enable customers to simplify and speed their transition to the cloud and are sold through direct sales teams, the Azure Marketplace and a robust community of channel partners. 

8

Google

Citrix and Google Cloud have been strategic partners for over a decade. We offer end-to-end user experience solutions for Citrix Workspace with GCP, Chrome Enterprise, and Google Workspace, as well as complementary App Delivery and Security. These solutions enable companies to deliver unified access to all of the apps employees need and prefer to use on Google devices and operating systems.

Global System Integrators

We continue to invest in partnerships with Global System Integrators who provide solutions and services that build on Citrix Workspace and Citrix App Delivery and Security solutions to improve employee experience and engagement, including Capgemini, Deloitte, DXC, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard Enterprises, IBM and Wipro. These partnerships help our customers develop effective digital workspace strategies that enable them to deliver a consistent work experience across work channels and locations.

Citrix Ready Partner Program

We also provide an easy way for our customers to locate compatible solutions and our channel partners to evaluate and deploy joint offerings through our Citrix Ready program. The Citrix Ready Partner Program is a technology partner program that helps software and hardware vendors of all types develop and integrate their products with Citrix technology. It includes partners like Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), Cisco, Google, and Microsoft and hundreds of other technology companies. Hybrid work has opened a whole new set of security concerns that companies must address. To help them do it, we expanded the Citrix Ready Workspace Security Program to include Zero Trust solutions from trusted and verified partners. This expansion allows companies to simplify the selection of vendors and leverage their existing investments to design a modern security framework that delivers Zero Trust outcomes.

Research and Development 

Our research and development efforts focus on developing new functionalities across our solutions, while continuing to invest in purposeful improvements to our core technologies. We solicit extensive feedback concerning product development from customers and through our channel distributors and partners, as well as our alliance partners. We believe that our global software development teams and our core technologies represent a significant competitive advantage for us. As of December 31, 2021, we held a worldwide portfolio of approximately 4,000 patents and had approximately 2,300 additional patent applications pending. We incurred research and development expenses of $581.6 million in 2021, $538.1 million in 2020 and $518.9 million in 2019. 

Sales, Marketing and Services 

We market and license our solutions through multiple channels worldwide, including selling through resellers, direct and over the Web. Our partner community comprises thousands of value-added resellers, or VARs, known as Citrix Solution Advisors, value-added distributors, or VADs, system integrators, or SIs, independent software vendors, or ISVs, OEMs, and Citrix Service Providers, or CSPs. Distribution channels are managed by our worldwide sales and services organization. Partners receive training and certification opportunities to support our portfolio of solutions and services.

We reward our partners that identify new business, and provide sales expertise, services delivery, customer education, technical implementation and support of our portfolio of solutions through our incentive program. We continue to focus on increasing the productivity of our existing partners, while also adding new transacting partners, building capacity through targeted recruitment, and introducing programs to increase partner mindshare, limit channel conflict, and increase partner loyalty to us.

As our customers shift workloads to the cloud, we have been cultivating a global base of technology partners within our CSP program. Our CSP program provides subscription-based services in which the CSP partners host software services to their end users. Our CSP partners, consisting of managed service providers, ISVs, Citrix Solution Advisors, hosting providers and telcos, among others, license certain of our offerings on a monthly consumption basis. With our software, these partners then create differentiated offerings of their own, consisting of cloud-hosted applications and cloud-hosted desktops, which they manage for various customers, ranging from SMBs to enterprise IT. Besides supplying technology, we are actively engaged in assisting these partners in developing their hosted businesses either within their respective data centers or leveraging public cloud infrastructure by supplying business and marketing assistance.

Online marketplaces, including Cloud Marketplaces and Cloud Service Brokers have become a strategic channel for customers to streamline the discovery, acquisition, deployment, and operations of services enabling them to adapt quickly to 

9

changing market conditions. Growth in the use of online marketplaces has been driven by the increased focus on cloud services and the increase in demand for work-at-home, business continuity, and remote access to services and data.

We are present in three key cloud marketplaces, AWS, Azure and Google, that enable customers to easily deploy licenses acquired through multiple channels, quickly acquire new services and software, and expand as their needs grow. We provide both public and private options to drive customer and partner success. 

Engagement with SIs and ISVs continues to be a substantial part of our strategic roadmap within large enterprise and government markets. Our integrator partnerships include organizations such as DXC, Fujitsu, IBM, Wipro and others, who all deliver consultancy or global offerings powered by Citrix solutions. The ISV program maintains a strong representation across targeted industry verticals including healthcare, financial services and telecommunications. Members in the ISV program include Allscripts, Cerner Corporation and Epic Systems Corporation. For all of our channels, we regularly take actions to improve the effectiveness of our partner programs and further strengthen our channel relationships through management of non-performing partners, recruitment of partners with expertise in selling into new markets and forming additional strategic global and national partnerships.

Our corporate marketing organization provides an integrated global approach to sales and industry event support, digital and social marketing, sales enablement tools and collateral, advertising, direct mail, industry analyst relations and public relations coverage to market our solutions. Our efforts in marketing are focused on generating leads for our sales organization and our indirect channels to acquire net new accounts and expand our presence with existing customers, as well as building general brand awareness in the market. Our partner development organization actively supports our partners to improve their commitment and capabilities with Citrix solutions. Our customer sales organization consists of field-based sales engineers and corporate sales professionals who work directly with our largest customers, and coordinate integration services provided by our partners. Additional sales personnel, working in central locations and in the field, provide support including recruitment of prospective partners and technical training with respect to our solutions.

In fiscal year 2021, 2020 and 2019, one distributor accounted for 17%, 17% and 15% respectively, of our total net revenues. The Company's arrangements with the distributor consist of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its respective subsidiaries, each of which covers different countries or regions. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for information regarding our revenue recognition policy.

International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for 49.7% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021, 50.5% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, and 48.2% of our net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. For detailed information on our international revenues, please refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Segment Revenue

We operate under one reportable segment. For additional information, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Operations

For our cloud-based solutions, we primarily use Microsoft Azure, AWS and GCP, as well as other infrastructure-as-a-service providers in combination with co-located hosting facilities. For our App Delivery and Security products, we use independent contractors to provide a redundant source of manufacture and assembly capabilities. Independent contractors provide us with the flexibility needed to meet our product quality and delivery requirements. We have manufacturing relationships that we enter into in the ordinary course of business, primarily with Flextronics, under which we have subcontracted the majority of our hardware manufacturing activity, generally on a purchase order basis. These third-party contract manufacturers also provide final test, warehousing and shipping services. This subcontracting activity extends from prototypes to full production and includes activities such as material procurement, final assembly, test, control, shipment to our customers and repairs. Together with our contract manufacturers, we design, specify and monitor the tests that are required to meet internal and external quality standards. Our contract manufacturers produce our products based on forecasted demand for our solutions. Each of the contract manufacturers procures components necessary to assemble the products in our forecast and test the products according to our specifications. We dual-source our components; however, in some instances, those sources may be located in the same geographic area. Accordingly, if a natural disaster occurs in one of those areas, we may need to seek additional sources. Products are then shipped to our distributors, VARs or end-users. If the products go unsold for specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for products ordered to meet our forecast or 

10

customer orders. In 2021, we did not experience any material difficulties or significant delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products.

While it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized orders, at any given time, we have confirmed product license orders that have not shipped and are unfulfilled. Backlog includes the aggregate amounts we expect to recognize as point-in-time revenue in the following quarter associated with contractually committed amounts for on-premise subscription software licenses, as well as confirmed product license orders that have not shipped and are wholly unfulfilled. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amount of backlog was not material. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance.

We believe that our fourth quarter revenues and expenses are affected by a number of seasonal factors, including the lapse of many corporations' fiscal year budgets and an increase in amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans due to compensation plan accelerators that are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. Historically, our revenue for the fourth quarter of any year is typically higher than the revenue for the first quarter of the subsequent year. In addition, our European operations usually generate lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. This seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues on a sequential basis. 

Competition 

We sell our solutions in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. As the markets for our solutions and services continue to develop in response to the pandemic, additional companies, including those with significant market presence in the computer appliances, software, cloud services and App Delivery and Security industries, have entered the markets in which we compete and further intensified competition, and will continue to do so. As a result, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future, and we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See our “Technology Relationships” discussion above and “Risk Factors” below. 

Workspace

Our primary competitors for various components of and services delivered through our Workspace offering include VMware, Okta, Box, Dropbox, Amazon Web Services, or AWS, Nutanix, Ivanti, Asana, Atlassian, Monday.com, Adobe, Smartsheet, Google Cloud and Microsoft. We believe Citrix Workspace and our services, including Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops, alongside our work solutions which include Collaborative Work Management and Citrix Content Collaboration, are differentiated by the completeness of the offerings, and the advanced technology and integrated end-user experience, as compared to competitive offerings by others. Compared to its competitors, we believe the Citrix digital work platform is differentiated by its ability to handle even the most complex workflows in a secure, integrated, intelligent and scalable way for any individual, team, department, or organization.

App Delivery and Security

Our hardware products compete in traditional data-center-deployed application environments against other established competitors, including F5 Networks, Radware, A10 Networks and Cisco. In addition, for cloud-integrated and software-centric use cases, large cloud providers, such as AWS and Microsoft Azure, provide customers with competitive application delivery controller solutions built into their public cloud platforms. We continue to expand our open source integrations with leading companies to enhance feature capability and invest in go-to-market resources to market our application delivery solutions to our existing customer base and new potential customers. 

Technology and Intellectual Property

We believe that innovation is a core Citrix competency. Our success is dependent upon our solutions, which are based on intellectual property and core proprietary and open source technologies. These technologies include innovations that optimize the end-to-end user experience, through cloud-managed workspaces and analytics, in virtual desktop and virtual application environments, and enhance App Delivery and Security capabilities to deliver a holistic and secure content collaboration and mobile computing experience.

We have been awarded numerous domestic and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. Certain of our technology is also protected under copyright laws. Additionally, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and proprietary information agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We have established proprietary trademark rights in markets across the globe, and own hundreds of U.S. and foreign trademark 

11

registrations and pending registration applications for marks comprised of or incorporating the Citrix name. See our “Research and Development” discussion above and “Risk Factors” below.

Our People

We believe Citrix solutions enable a better way to work and embrace the power of human difference, and we are guided by our core values of Integrity, Respect, Curiosity, Courage and Unity. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 9,700 employees, of which approximately 41% were in the United States and 59% were in our international locations. We have a broad base of diverse talent in more than 44 countries, and we believe that attracting, developing and retaining the best talent is critical to our success and achievement of our strategic objectives. Our voluntary attrition rate was approximately 17% during fiscal year 2021.

Leadership and Governance

Our Executive Vice President and Chief People Officer is responsible for developing and executing the company’s human capital strategy. This includes directing our global policies and programs for leadership and talent development, compensation, benefits, staffing and workforce planning, human resources systems, skills training and organizational development, workplace strategies, and ensuring effective and efficient internal company operations. Our Chief People Officer is also responsible for developing and integrating our diversity, equity and inclusion priorities and strategy, and we have a dedicated team of people with executive leadership participation to implement such strategies.

Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversees our company-wide compensation programs and practices. Our Interim Chief Executive Officer and President and Chief People Officer regularly update our Board of Directors and the Compensation and Human Capital Committee on human capital matters.

Compensation and Benefits

Our team is global, and we offer competitive and meaningful compensation and benefits programs that meet the diverse needs of our employees, while also reflecting local market practices. In addition to competitive salaries and bonuses, we offer a robust employment total rewards package that promotes employee well-being and includes retirement planning, health care, extended parental leave and paid time off.

Equity-based compensation is also a key component in attracting, retaining and motivating our employees. We grant equity-based compensation to a significant portion of our employees. We also provide the opportunity for equity ownership through our employee stock purchase plan.

Additionally, we offer benefits to support our employees’ physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health and encourage healthy behaviors. 

Growth, Development and Engagement

At Citrix, we have a strong focus on career development and building the capabilities of our team members. We invest in our employees by offering a wide range of development opportunities that promote learning and growth, various mentoring and coaching programs, a large library of on-demand, virtual and in-person courses that support professional and technical skills development and our tuition reimbursement program. We also believe in building organizational capability through practicing a growth mindset and continuously listening to our employees in order to create desirable employee experiences. We survey our employees frequently, providing managers and teams with highly actionable data that allows us to focus on making improvements in areas that have the largest impact on engagement and team success.

Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging

Diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging have long been a part of our culture, and we work to continually expand our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives. We have an employee-run committee focused on diversity, inclusion and belonging initiatives, which are supported by our executive leadership team. For example, we expanded our Daring Dialogue series to include discussions on mental health, faith in the workplace, and disability and accessibility. We also launched the Citrix Employee Relief Fund to help employees and contractors through extreme financial hardships and set Environmental, Social, and Governance goals for our executive leaders, supporting them with strategies and plans to effect change within their organizations. Our learning series, “I AM Citrix”, shares best practices, builds understanding and offers support to employees as we champion inclusiveness and belonging across the enterprise. The program helps employees deepen their understanding of the culture of inclusion at Citrix, reinforces skills and concepts to support behavior change that encourage an inclusive work environment and creates meaningful connections through open dialogue.

12

Our employee resource groups (ERGs) support underrepresented groups of employees and are an important component of our diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging efforts, addressing topics like career development, mentoring, recruiting and interviewing candidates, advocacy and networking. As of December 31, 2021, we had ten ERGs with 29 chapters across nine offices in seven countries.

In 2021, we continued to advance our equity strategy with the objectives of supporting black students and businesses, modifying our people processes to promote racial equity, transparently sharing data as we progress on our journey, and personal learning about systemic racism. Some of our accomplishments included, launching two mentoring programs, implementing several career landing page websites, expanding the scope of our pay equity analysis to include stock, and growing our external sponsorships to support the recruitment and development of Black students.

COVID-19 Response

During the COVID-19 pandemic, our primary focus has been on the safety and well-being of our employees and their families. A large majority of our workforce worked remotely and successfully throughout 2021. For offices that re-opened, we leveraged the advice and recommendations of medical experts to implement new protocols to ensure the safety of our employees, including face coverings, temperature checks, health certifications, social distancing and capacity limits. We supported our employees through programs and benefits provided throughout the year, pivoting all of our people programs and practices to enable business continuity in the current environment.

Importantly, our response to the COVID-19 pandemic reflects our belief that work is a measure of output and accomplishment—not a place—and flexible work means people are most productive when they match their work environment to the outcomes they are trying to deliver. Our success in implementing this work philosophy during the pandemic has driven an evolution in our flexible work approach.

Sustainability

Climate Change

We believe that our solutions facilitate customers’ transition to long-term and flexible work models, helping customers to accelerate their sustainability goals by decreasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions - driving down corporate office space needs, enabling a shift from energy-intensive desktops and high-performance processors to more energy-efficient devices. 

As companies implement commitments to dramatically reduce GHG emissions in response to regulation and/or business trends, this may include optimizing IT practices that lead to an increase in demand for our remote working and cloud services. Our cloud-based and remote workforce solutions enable customers to safeguard against potential operational disruptions that may be caused by climate-related extreme weather events. These climate impacts can hold significant consequences for company operations, in particular for those in the technology sector. Our cloud-based solutions enable our customers to address concerns around business continuity as a result of climate-related disruptions.

Climate Change Governance

As part of its oversight function, the Audit Committee regularly reviews the compliance policies and processes by which our exposure to certain significant areas of risk—including climate-related risk—is assessed and managed.

Our Chief Financial Officer regularly reviews and approves updates and decisions related to our climate change and environmental sustainability strategy, such as investments in programs and initiatives that advance Citrix's emissions reduction and renewable energy strategy.

We encourage you to review our Sustainability Report for more detailed information regarding our human capital and sustainability programs, strategy and initiatives. Nothing in our Sustainability Report shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
