ITEM 7A - QUANTITATIVE

 AND QUALITATIVE

 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We

 are

 exposed

 to

 market

 risk

 stemming

 from

 changes

 in

 interest

 and

 foreign

 exchange

 rates

 and

 commodity

 and

 equity

 prices. 

Changes

 in

 these

 factors

 could

 cause

 fluctuations

 in

 our

 earnings

 and

 cash

 flows.

 In

 the

 normal

 course

 of

 business,

 we

 actively 

manage

 our

 exposure

 to

 these market

 risks

 by entering

 into various

 hedging

 transactions,

 authorized

 under

 established

 policies

 that 

place controls

 on these

 activities. The

 counterparties

 in these

 transactions are

 generally

 highly rated

 institutions. We

 establish

 credit 

limits for

 each counterparty.

 Our hedging

 transactions include

 but are

 not limited

 to a variety

 of derivative

 financial instruments.

 For 

information

 on

 interest

 rate,

 foreign

 exchange,

 commodity

 price,

 and

 equity

 instrument

 risk,

Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report. 

VALUE

 AT RISK 

The

 estimates

 in

 the

 table below

 are

 intended

 to measure

 the

 maximum

 potential

 fair value

 we

 could

 lose

 in one

 day

 from

 adverse 

changes

 in

 market

 interest

 rates,

 foreign

 exchange

 rates,

 commodity

 prices,

 and

 equity

 prices

 under

 normal

 market

 conditions.

 A 

Monte Carlo

 value-at-risk (VAR)

 methodology was

 used to

 quantify the

 market risk

 for our

 exposures. The

 models assumed

 normal 

market conditions and used a 95 percent confidence level. 

The

 VAR

 calculation

 used

 historical

 interest

 and

 foreign

 exchange

 rates,

 and

 commodity

 and

 equity

 prices

 from

 the

 past

 year

 to 

estimate the

 potential volatility

 and correlation

 of these

 rates in

 the future.

 The market

 data were

 drawn from

 the RiskMetrics™

 data 

set.

 The

 calculations

 are

 not

 intended

 to

 represent

 actual

 losses

 in

 fair

 value

 that

 we

 expect

 to

 incur.

 Further,

 since

 the

 hedging 

instrument (the derivative) inversely correlates

 with the underlying exposure, we would

 expect that any loss or gain in the fair

 value of 

our

 derivatives

 would

 be

 generally

 offset

 by

 an

 increase

 or

 decrease

 in

 the

 fair

 value

 of

 the

 underlying

 exposure.

 The

 positions 

included

 in the

 calculations were:

 debt; investments;

 interest rate

 swaps; foreign

 exchange forwards;

 commodity swaps,

 futures, and 

options; and

 equity instruments.

 The calculations

 do not

 include the

 underlying foreign

 exchange

 and commodities

 or equity-related 

positions that are offset by these market-risk-sensitive instruments.

The table below

 presents the estimated maximum

 potential VAR

 arising from a

 one-day loss in

 fair value for

 our interest rate, foreign 

currency, commodity,

 and equity market-risk-sensitive instruments outstanding as of May 29,

 2022.
