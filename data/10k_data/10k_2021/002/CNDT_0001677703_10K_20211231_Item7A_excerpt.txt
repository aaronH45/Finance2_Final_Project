ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

We are exposed to market risk from foreign currency exchange rates, which could affect operating results, financial position and cash flows. We manage our exposure to this market risk through our regular operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, using derivative financial instruments. We utilized derivative financial instruments to hedge economic exposures, as well as reduce earnings and cash flow volatility resulting from shifts in market rates. We also hedge the cost to fund material non-dollar entities by buying currencies periodically in advance of the funding date. This is accounted for using derivative accounting.

Recent market events have not caused us to materially modify or change our financial risk management strategies with respect to our exposures to foreign currency risk. Refer to Note 12 â€“ Financial Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on our financial risk management. 

Foreign Exchange Risk Management

Assuming a 10% appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2021, the potential change in the fair value of foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities in each entity would not be significant because all material currency asset and liability exposures were economically hedged as of December 31, 2021. A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against all currencies from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2021 would have an impact on our cumulative translation adjustment portion of equity of approximately $77 million. The net amount invested in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, primarily in the U.K. and Europe, and translated into U.S. Dollars using the year-end exchange rates, was approximately $772 million at December 31, 2021.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The consolidated weighted-average interest rates related to our total debt for 2021 approximated 3.10% for 2021 Term A Loan due 2026, 5.00% for 2021 Term B Loan due 2028, 6.04% for 2021 Senior Notes due 2029, 2.58% for our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility maturing 2026 and 5.01% for finance lease obligations. As of December 31, 2021, $880 million of our total debt of $1,440 million carried variable interest rates. The fair values of our fixed rate financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates and at December 31, 2021, a 10% increase in market interest rates would decrease the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $19 million. A 10% decrease in market interest rates would increase the fair values of such financial instruments by approximately $20 million.
