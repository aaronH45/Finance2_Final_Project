PART I

Item 1. Business

Fluor Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in September, 2000. However, through our predecessors, we have been in business for over a century.

Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "FLR".

Fluor Corporation is a holding company that owns many subsidiaries, as well as interests in joint ventures. Acting through these entities, we are one of the larger global professional services firms providing EPC, fabrication and modularization, and project management services, on a global basis. We provide these services to our clients in a diverse set of industries worldwide including production and fuels, chemicals, LNG, nuclear project services, infrastructure, advanced technologies, life sciences and mining and metals. We are also a service provider to the U.S. federal government and governments abroad.

During the first quarter of 2021, we began operating our business through four segments. These segments include: Energy Solutions, Urban Solutions, Mission Solutions and Other. Fluor Constructors International, Inc., which is organized and operates separately from the rest of our business, provides unionized management and construction services in the United States and Canada, both independently and as a subcontractor on projects for Fluor.

In January 2021, we outlined four strategic priorities for driving value creation for our shareholders:

•Drive growth across our portfolio, by growing markets outside of the traditional oil and gas sector, including energy transition, advanced technology and life sciences, high-demand metals, infrastructure and nuclear and civil, defense and intelligence for governments;

•Pursue contracts with fair and balanced commercial terms, focusing on more favorable, risk-adjusted agreements that reward Fluor for value;

•Reinforce financial discipline, maintaining a solid balance sheet by generating predictable cash flow and earnings; and

•Foster a high-performance culture with purpose, by advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and promoting social progress and sustainability.

In 2021, we completed a number of transactions in support of our strategic priorities. In May 2021, we sold the North American portion of our construction equipment business, AMECO. Additionally, in May 2021, we issued 600,000 shares of Series A 6.5% cumulative perpetual CPS in a private transaction. We used the majority of the net proceeds of this offering to complete a tender offer in which we purchased a cumulative $483 million of our outstanding 2023 and 2024 Notes. In 2021, we also redeemed $26 million of outstanding 2023 and 2024 Notes in open market transactions. For further information on these transactions please see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In December 2021, we announced that NuScale, in which we are the majority investor, signed a merger agreement with Spring Valley Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company ("Spring Valley"). Spring Valley is acquiring an approximately 20% interest in NuScale. The proposed transaction is anticipated to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions. Upon completion of the merger, we estimate that we will own approximately 60-70% of the combined company and expect that we will continue to consolidate it.

Competitive Strengths

As a world-class provider of technical and professional services, we believe that we bring capital efficient business solutions that combine excellence in execution, safety, cost containment and experience to our clients. In that regard, we believe that our business advantages and global positioning provide us with significant competitive strengths:

Safety. One of our core values is our constant focus on safety. Maintaining a safe and secure workplace is a key business driver for us and our clients. In our experience, whether in an office or at a jobsite, a safe environment decreases risks, provides for the well-being of all workers, enhances morale, improves productivity, reduces project cost and generally improves client relations. We believe that our commitment to safety is one of our most distinguishing features.

Global Execution Platform. As one of the larger publicly traded EPC companies, we have a global footprint with employees located throughout the world. Our global presence enables us to build local relationships to capitalize on opportunities as well as mobilize quickly to project sites around the world and to draw on our local knowledge and talent 

3
pools. We continue to form strategic alliances with local partners, leverage our supply chain expertise and emphasize local training programs. We also provide services from our distributed execution centers on a cost-efficient basis.

Excellence in Execution. We believe that our ability to execute, maintain and manage complex projects, large or small and often in geographically challenging locations, gives us a distinct competitive advantage. We strive to complete our projects meeting or exceeding all client specifications. We have continued to shift toward data-driven execution, which we expect will enhance our ability to meet our clients' needs.

Market Diversity. We serve multiple markets across a broad spectrum of industries around the globe. Our market diversity helps to mitigate the impact of the cyclicality in the markets we serve and allows us to strive for more consistent growth. We believe that maintaining a good mixture within our entire business portfolio permits us to both focus on our more stable business markets and to capitalize on cyclical markets when the timing is appropriate.

Client Relationships. We actively pursue relationships with new clients while also building on our long-term relationships with existing clients. We believe that long-term relationships with existing clients serve us well by allowing us to better understand and be more responsive to their requirements. Regardless of whether our clients are new or have been with us for many decades, our ability to successfully foster relationships is a key strength.

Risk Management. We believe we have the ability to assess, mitigate and manage project risk, especially in difficult locations or circumstances. We have an experienced management team, and utilize a systematic and disciplined approach towards identifying, assessing and managing risks. We believe that our risk management approach helps us control costs and meet clients' schedules.

Sustainability. Our sustainability mission envisions meeting the needs of our clients while conducting business in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. We consistently apply prudent governance principles to the benefit of current and future generations, thereby creating value for all stakeholders. Every day, we help clients safeguard the environment, conserve energy, protect lives, and strengthen the economies and social structures of communities in which our employees work and live.

General Operations

Our services fall into five broad categories (outlined below). Our services can range from basic consulting activities, often at the early stages of a project, to complete design-build, operations and maintenance contracts.

•In engineering and design, we develop solutions to address our clients’ most complex problems. Our engineering services range from traditional engineering disciplines such as piping, mechanical, electrical, control systems, civil, structural and architectural to advanced engineering specialties including process engineering, chemical engineering, simulation, integrated automation processes and interactive 3-D modeling. Through our design solutions, we can provide clients with varied offerings which can include front-end engineering, conceptual design, estimating, feasibility studies, permitting, process simulation, technology and licensing evaluation, scope definition and siting.

•Our procurement offerings include procurement and supply chain solutions aimed at improving product quality and performance while also reducing project cost and schedule. Our clients draw upon our global sourcing and supply expertise, global purchasing power, technical knowledge, processes, systems and experienced global resources. Our procurement activities include strategic sourcing, material management, contracts management, buying, expediting, supplier quality inspection and logistics.

•In construction, we mobilize, execute, commission and demobilize projects on a self-perform and subcontracted basis. Generally, we are responsible for the completion of a project, often in difficult locations and under challenging circumstances. We are frequently designated as program manager, and serve as such in cases where the client has facilities in multiple locations, complex phases in a single project location, or a large-scale investment in one facility.

•We also provide a variety of fabrication and modularization services, including integrated engineering and modular fabrication and assembly, as well as modular construction and asset support services to clients around the globe from our joint venture yards. By operating our own yards in key regions of the world, we help our clients achieve cost and schedule savings by reducing on-site craft needs and shifting work to inherently safer and more controlled work environments.

4
•We offer operations and maintenance services intended to improve the performance and extend the life of our clients’ facilities. This may include the global delivery of services to include facility management, technical facility operations, plant readiness, commissioning, start-up and maintenance technology, small capital projects, turnaround and outage services and recapitalization of facilities and infrastructure. Among other things, we can provide key management, staffing and management skills to clients on-site at their facilities. These activities also include routine and outage/turnaround maintenance services, general maintenance and asset management, emissions reduction technologies and services, and restorative, repair, predictive and prevention services.

•Project management involves managing all aspects of the effort to deliver projects on schedule and within budget, and is critical on every project. We are often hired as the overall program manager on large complex projects where various contractors and subcontractors are involved and multiple activities need to be integrated to ensure the success of the overall project. Our services include logistics, development of project execution plans, detailed schedules, cost forecasts, progress tracking and reporting, and the integration of EPC efforts. Project management is accountable to the client to deliver the safety, functionality and financial performance requirements of the project.

Business Segments

Energy Solutions

Our Energy Solutions segment focuses on opportunities in the production and fuels, chemicals, LNG and nuclear project services markets. We provide solutions to the energy transition markets, including asset decarbonization, carbon capture, renewable fuels, waste-to-energy, green chemicals, hydrogen, nuclear power and other low-carbon energy sources. At the same time, we continue to serve the traditional oil, gas and petrochemical industries with full project life-cycle services, including expansion and modernization projects as well as sustaining capital work. While we perform work on projects that range greatly in size and scope, we believe that one of our distinguishing features is our global strength and experience to perform very large projects in difficult locations. As energy and chemicals projects have become more challenging geographically, geopolitically or otherwise, we believe that clients will continue to look to us to manage their complex projects based on our size, strength, global reach, experience, technical expertise and proven track record.

With each specific project, our role can vary. We may be involved in providing front-end engineering, program management and final design services, construction management services, self-perform construction, or oversight of other contractors, and we may also assume responsibility for the procurement of materials, equipment and subcontractors. We have the capacity to design, fabricate and construct new facilities, upgrade, modernize and expand existing facilities, and rebuild facilities following fires and explosions. We also provide consulting services ranging from feasibility studies to process assessments to project finance structuring.

In production and fuels, we execute projects for the oil and gas production, processing and refining industries, including an increasing component of energy transition. In the upstream sector, our typical projects involve the production, processing and transporting of oil and gas, including the development of infrastructure associated with major new fields and pipelines. We are also involved in offshore production facilities and in gas processing projects. In the downstream sector, our clients have been modernizing and modifying existing refineries to increase capacity, improve margins and improve environmental performance. We are active in the repurposing of existing refining facilities for the production of renewable fuels. We are also focused on other transition markets, such as carbon capture and sequestration, blue and green hydrogen, ammonia and other low carbon solutions, as an increasing number of clients and countries implement stronger sustainable energy goals.

We have been very active for several decades in the chemicals and petrochemicals market, with major projects in the ethylene-based markets as well as in a variety of specialty chemicals. The most active markets have been in the United States, Middle East and Asia, where there is significant demand for chemical products. We are also active in battery chemicals projects and we are engaging with clients on implementing lower carbon solutions on their existing and new facilities.

We have participated in a wide variety of LNG developments, including liquefaction, floating LNG facilities and regasification terminals. Our work in LNG has included feasibility studies, technology evaluations, technical audits, process equipment optimization and selection, basic design, project specifications development, permitting support, front-end engineering and design, detailed EPC and start-up assistance.

In the nuclear project services market, we provide a full range of services for small modular reactor technologies and operations support for existing nuclear power facilities and managing waste. Through our relationship with NuScale, we can offer a complete project solution for carbon free power by utilizing NuScale's proprietary SMR technology, a market that is gaining significant momentum with the push to more sustainable energy sources.

Urban Solutions

Our Urban Solutions segment provides EPC and project management services to the advanced technologies, life sciences, mining and metals, and infrastructure industries, as well as professional staffing services.

For the advanced technologies market, we provide program management and EPC services to a wide variety of companies on a global basis. Our experience spans a wide variety of market segments, including advanced materials, data storage and computing, fast-moving consumer goods, food and beverage, semiconductors, smart batteries and specialty products. We specialize in designing projects that incorporate lean manufacturing concepts while also satisfying client sustainability goals.

In life sciences, we provide front end studies and EPC services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, medical devices and animal health industries. We also specialize in providing validation and commissioning services where we not only bring new facilities into production, but we also extend the life, or improve efficiencies, of existing facilities. We believe the ability to complete projects on a large-scale basis, especially in a business where time to market is critical, enables us to better serve our clients and is a key competitive advantage.

In mining and metals, we provide a full range of services to our clients who produce a variety of commodities, including bauxite, copper, gold, iron ore, diamond, alumina, aluminum and phosphates. We have the experience required to support the increasing demand for battery metals, including lithium, platinum and nickel, due to urbanization and the transition to clean energy. We also serve the fertilizer industry and provide services in the downstream metals market. Our services include conceptual and feasibility studies through detailed EPC, commissioning and startup support. Many of these opportunities are being developed in remote and logistically challenging environments, such as the Andes Mountains, Western Australia and Africa. We believe we are one of the few companies with the size, regional presence and experience to execute large scale mining and metals projects in these difficult and remote locations. 

We are an industry leader in developing infrastructure projects such as roads, highways, bridges and rail for governments, with particular interest in large, complex projects. We provide a broad range of services including consulting, design, planning, financial structuring, engineering and construction. We also provide long-term operation and maintenance services for transit and highway projects. Our projects may involve the use of public/private partnerships, which allow us to develop and finance deals in concert with public entities for projects such as toll roads and rail lines that would not have otherwise been undertaken with public funding alone. Continuing urbanization and the replacement and expansion of aging infrastructure in North America continues to drive project opportunities.

Historically, we have also offered a full range of services to the power industry including EPC, program management, startup and commissioning and technical services to utilities, independent power producers, original equipment manufacturers and other third parties. In recent years, this has become an increasingly smaller component of our business, though some projects remain in our portfolio. 

The segment's staffing services are provided through TRS Staffing Solutions®. TRS is a global enterprise of staffing specialists that provides the company and third-party clients with technical, professional and craft resources either on a contract or permanent placement basis.

Mission Solutions

Mission Solutions is a provider of high-end technical solutions to the U.S. and other governments. The segment's nuclear and civil business holds a tier 1 position with differentiated expertise in managing complex national security missions across the Department of Energy and the National Nuclear Security Administration. We deliver solutions for nuclear security and operations, nuclear waste management and laboratory management. Additionally, we are an industry leader in nuclear remediation at governmental facilities providing site management, environmental remediation, and decommissioning of facilities and have been successful in addressing environmental and regulatory challenges associated with legacy and operational nuclear sites. We also provide services to commercial nuclear clients. In civil services, we are a partner to FEMA for disaster recovery and are one of their top contractors.

In defense, we deliver operations and maintenance, global logistics, EPC, life support and operations of mission critical facilities across U.S. military service organizations. We can rapidly mobilize people and equipment to deliver solutions across the globe and in the harshest environments. We believe we can deliver the solutions to our military clients no matter how remote the location or how quickly services are required. From life support and logistics services for special forces across Africa, to building and managing facilities for Afghan evacuees in the U.S., to building a runway on Ascension Island, we believe we have the people, tools and skills to provide services that are unmatched among our peers.

6
For our intelligence clients, we have more than 600 cleared personnel providing critical infrastructure solutions such as data center management, operations and maintenance of secure facilities and technology platform services. We construct and renovate secure facilities for the intelligence community in more than 20 countries, and support both enduring and contingency missions. We believe we are trusted by our clients to ensure their mission success. 

Other

Our Other segment includes the operations of NuScale, in which we are the majority investor. NuScale has developed an NRC standard design approved SMR technology, which we believe will be a leader in the development of light water, passively safe SMRs, providing us with significant future project opportunities.

Discontinued Operations

The sale of the North American portion of our AMECO equipment business was completed in May 2021. In the first quarter of 2021, we also committed to a plan to sell our Stork business. Both Stork and the remaining AMECO operations are reported as Disc Ops for all periods presented.

AMECO provides integrated construction equipment, tool, scaffolding and fleet service solutions to the company and third-party clients in a focused number of locations around the world for construction projects and client production assets. Stork provides asset maintenance and asset integrity services to the oil and gas, chemicals, life sciences, power, mining and metals, consumer products and manufacturing industries.

Other Matters

Backlog

Backlog represents the total amount of revenue we expect to record in the future based upon contracts that have been awarded to us. Backlog is stated in terms of gross revenues and may include significant estimated amounts of third-party, subcontracted and pass-through costs.

Backlog in the engineering and construction industry is a measure of the value of work to be performed on contracts already awarded and those in progress.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________________________________________________________________________

(1)The temporary staffing business in the Urban Solutions segment does not report backlog or new awards based on the nature of its business. For projects related to proportionately consolidated joint ventures, we include only our percentage ownership of each joint venture's backlog.

(2)Includes backlog of $1.1 billion and $1.8 billion for projects in a loss position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Although backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm, cancellations, deferrals or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange 

7
fluctuations and project deferrals, as appropriate. The terms and conditions of some contracts include elements of both lump-sum and reimbursable contracts. Also, certain contracts may be converted from reimbursable to lump-sum. Due to additional factors outside of our control, such as changes in project schedules, we cannot accurately predict the exact timing that our December 31, 2021 backlog will be earned as revenue. Accordingly, backlog is not necessarily indicative of future earnings or revenues and no assurances can be provided that we will ultimately realize revenue on our backlog.

The following table sets forth our changes in consolidated backlog:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) During 2021, we removed $2 billion from backlog due to the cancellation of a steel project and a chemicals project.

In 2022, we expect to perform approximately 50% of our total backlog reported as of December 31, 2021, which is in line with the last three years. 

Types of Contracts

While the basic terms and conditions of the contracts that we perform may vary considerably, we typically perform our work under two types of contracts: (a) reimbursable contracts and (b) lump-sum or guaranteed maximum contracts. In some markets, we are seeing hybrid contracts containing both lump-sum and reimbursable elements. As of December 31, 2021, the following table summarizes contract type within our ending backlog:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In accordance with industry practice, most of our contracts are subject to termination at the discretion of our client. In such situations, our contracts typically provide for the payment of fees earned through the date of termination and the reimbursement of costs incurred including demobilization costs.

Under reimbursable contracts, the client reimburses us based upon negotiated rates and pays us a pre-determined fee, or a fee based upon a percentage of the cost incurred in completing the project. Our profit may be in the form of a fee, a simple markup applied to labor cost incurred in performing the contract, or a combination of the two. The fee element may also vary. The fee may be an incentive fee based upon achieving certain performance factors, milestones or targets; it may be a fixed amount in the contract; or it may be based upon a percentage of the cost incurred. In some cases, reimbursable contracts may be converted into lump-sum contracts.

Our Mission Solutions segment, primarily acting as a prime contractor or a major subcontractor for a number of government programs, generally performs its services under reimbursable contracts subject to applicable statutes and regulations. In many cases, these contracts include incentive fee arrangements. The programs may span many years and may be implemented by awards under multiple contracts. Some of our government contracts are known as indefinite delivery indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) agreements. Under these arrangements, we work closely with the government to define the scope and amount of work required based upon an estimate of the maximum amount that the government desires to spend. While the scope is often not initially fully defined or does not require any specific amount of work, once the project scope is determined, additional work may be awarded to us without the need for further competitive bidding.

Under lump-sum contracts, we typically bid based upon specifications provided by the client. This type of contracting presents risks because it requires us to predetermine the work to be performed, the project execution schedule and all costs associated with the work. Another type of lump-sum contract is a negotiated fixed-price contract, under which we are selected as contractor first, and then we negotiate price with the client. Negotiated fixed-price contracts frequently occur in single-responsibility arrangements where we perform some of the work before negotiating the total price for the project. Another type of lump-sum contract is a unit price contract under which we are paid a set amount for every “unit” of work 

8
performed. If we perform well under these types of contracts, we can benefit from cost savings. However, if the project does not proceed as originally planned, we may not be able to recover cost overruns except in certain situations.

Guaranteed maximum price contracts are reimbursable contracts except that the total fee plus the total cost cannot exceed an agreed upon guaranteed maximum price. We can be responsible for some or all of the total cost of the project if the cost exceeds the guaranteed maximum price. Where the total cost is less than the negotiated guaranteed maximum price, we may receive the benefit of the cost savings based upon a negotiated agreement with the client.

Some of our contracts, regardless of type, may operate under joint ventures or other teaming arrangements. Typically, we enter into these arrangements with reputable companies with whom we have worked previously. These arrangements are generally made to strengthen our market position or technical skills, or where the size, scale or location of the project directs the use of such arrangements.

Competition

We are one of the world’s larger providers of engineering, procurement, construction, fabrication and modularization, operations, maintenance and asset integrity, and project management services. The markets served by our business are highly competitive and, for the most part, require substantial resources and highly skilled and experienced technical personnel. A large number of companies compete against us, including U.S.-based companies such as AECOM, Amentum Services, Inc., Bechtel Group, Inc., EMCOR Group, Inc., Jacobs Engineering Group, Inc., KBR, Inc., Kiewit Corporation, Granite Construction, Inc. and Quanta Services, Inc., and international-based companies such as ACS Actividades de Construccion y Servicios, Balfour Beatty plc, Chiyoda Corporation, Hyundai Engineering & Construction Company, Ltd., JGC Corporation, McDermott International, Inc., Petrofac Limited, SNC-Lavalin Group, Inc., Samsung Engineering, Stantec Inc., Technip Energies N.V., Wood Group plc, and WorleyParsons Limited.

Competition for our Energy Solutions and Urban Solutions segments is based on an ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely and cost-efficient manner. We believe our engineering, procurement, fabrication and construction business derives its competitive strength from our market diversity, excellence in execution, reputation for quality, technology, cost-effectiveness, worldwide procurement capability, project management expertise, geographic coverage, ability to meet client requirements by performing construction on either a union or an open shop basis, ability to execute complex projects of varying sizes, strong safety record and lengthy experience with a wide range of services and technologies.

In Urban Solutions, temporary staffing is a highly fragmented market with over 1,000 companies competing globally. The key competitive factors in this business line are price, service, quality, client relationships, breadth of service and the ability to identify and retain qualified personnel and geographic coverage.

In our Mission Solutions segment, key competitive factors are primarily centered on performance, qualified personnel and the ability to provide the design, engineering, planning, management and project execution skills required to complete complex projects in a safe, timely, cost-efficient and compliant manner. 

Raw Materials

The principal products we use in our business include structural steel, metal plate, concrete, cable and various electrical and mechanical components. These products and components are subject to raw material (aluminum, copper, nickel, iron ore, etc.) availability and pricing fluctuations, which we monitor on a regular basis. We have access to numerous global supply sources; however, the availability and cost of these products, components and raw materials may vary significantly from year to year due to various factors including the logistics market, client demand, producer capacity, inflation, market conditions and specific material shortages.

Compliance with Government Regulations, Including Environmental, Safety and Health Matters

We provide services at sites throughout the world. Work at some of these sites involves activities related to nuclear facilities, hazardous waste, hydrocarbon production, distribution and transport, the military and infrastructure. Some of our work can be performed adjacent to environmentally sensitive locations such as wetlands, lakes and rivers. We also contract with governments to remediate hazardous materials, including chemical agents, as well as to decontaminate and decommission nuclear sites. These activities can require us to manage, handle, remove, treat, transport and dispose of toxic, radioactive or hazardous substances, and are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.

We believe that we are compliant with all environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. We further believe that any accruals with respect to future environmental costs are adequate and that any future costs will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations. Some factors, however, could result in additional expenditures or the provision of additional accruals in expectation of such expenditures. These include the imposition of more stringent 

9
requirements under environmental laws or regulations, new developments or changes regarding site cleanup costs or the allocation of such costs among potentially responsible parties, or a determination that we are potentially responsible for the release of hazardous substances at sites other than those currently identified.

Human Capital Management

We have built a high-performance culture with purpose and foster a diverse and inclusive workplace as a business imperative because people are our single greatest asset. A high performance culture, where everyone is treated fairly and respectfully and has equal access to opportunities based on capabilities and performance, regardless of background, raises both the individual and collective performance of our company. Our culture drives employee engagement, productivity and a sustainable competitive advantage.

The following summarizes our human capital information as of December 31, 2021:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The number of craft and hourly employees can vary in relation to the number, size and phase of execution of our projects. We have employees in the following regions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Health and Safety

Safety is one of our core values. We are committed to taking care of our employees and preventing injuries in our offices and project locations. Our robust programs and procedures help us mitigate the hazards inherent in the work we do. We are committed to fostering a caring, preventative culture founded on proactive action by engaged employees. We call this Safer TogetherSM. Our 2021 safety performance (calculated in accordance with OSHA record keeping requirements) resulted in a total case incident rate of 0.37 with COVID cases included (or 0.33 with COVID cases excluded), which both outperformed our goal of less than 0.40 (excluding COVID cases) and well below the comparable industry benchmarks.

In response to COVID, we implemented a number of measures to protect the well-being of our employees and mitigate COVID transmission within our offices and on our projects. In 2020, we established a global COVID task force and implemented actions to empower remote working, restrict non-essential business travel, enhance sanitation at our offices and project sites, and other return-to-work measures. In 2021, the global COVID task force continued to provide guidance for our sites and offices as the pandemic progressed and regulations changed in various locations. We promoted our existing employee assistance program to support employee well-being with a focus on mental health. We also issued an updated workplace flexibility policy for our employees who are not required to be onsite or in the office.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We are committed to advancing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I"). We believe that every voice matters, and we value DE&I at every level of our organization. We encourage diversity of cultures, innovation and perspectives as we build inclusive, high-performance teams. We listen actively, respect one another and foster an environment with a sense of pride and belonging. We engage and partner with stakeholders who represent and support gender, generation, sexual orientation, mental and physical ability, race and ethnic diversity. We encourage knowledge sharing among our employees and stakeholders. 

We are focused on delivering four key impact pillars to advance DE&I:

•Champion an inclusive culture;

10
•Recruit, develop and retain talent; 

•Enhance employee experience; and

•Improve social progress and impact.

We work with a variety of outreach, community and education organizations, including a range of universities. In 2021, we added three historically Black colleges and universities ("HBCUs") to Fluor’s Global University Sponsorship Program ("GUSP"). We announced that we will provide up to $1 million, including matching donations over three years, to North Carolina Agricultural & Technical State University, Prairie View A&M University in Texas and Tuskegee University in Alabama.

We are committed to strengthening our talent pipeline by expanding diversity in recruiting. We post our job openings internally and externally to reach a broad, diverse pool of candidates from all backgrounds. We have implemented a balanced slate candidate selection practice, which enables the identification of diverse candidates for positions across our offices and business lines.

We have established six regional inclusion councils to drive region-specific diversity and inclusion. In addition, we currently have four employee resource groups ("ERGs"): Black Employee Alliance (“BEA”), Emerging Leaders Group ("ELG"), Graduates Advancing to Professionalism ("GAP") and Growing Representation & Opportunity for Women ("GROW"). ERGs are a critical component of strengthening our culture of inclusion by encouraging employee engagement, attracting and retaining talent and offering allyship of shared identity individuals to share new ideas, insights and perspectives.

Development Opportunities

One of our top priorities is to provide ongoing training and development for our employees through multiple venues, including Fluor University, our online learning platform. Employees can select from among a wide variety of self-paced, online, virtual and instructor-led training courses. Topics range from our internally developed Fluor University courses focused on discipline-specific training, to commercially available technical learning and general knowledge topics, such as leadership, business acumen, communication and inclusive management. In 2021, our employees earned more than 55,000 credit hours through Fluor University. We have also developed several programs to help employees advance their careers, including Fluor Fellows for our technical experts and Mentoring Circles. In 2021, we also launched a new career development website.

Community Responsibility

Part of building a high-performance culture with purpose is offering employees robust and enriching opportunities to help build a better future. For more than 40 years, our employee volunteer program, Fluor Cares, has given employees a conduit for giving back to the communities where we live and work. In 2021, we launched a rebranded Fluor Cares 2.0 platform which consolidated both employee giving and volunteerism under the Fluor Cares banner and expanded the program to include 13 countries. The company match of 25 percent was expanded to several new cause categories, offering millions of nonprofit organizations to which employees can contribute. Despite lingering COVID protocols, our employees volunteered their time to hundreds of charitable organizations and causes.

We remained true to our legacy of giving back even as a variety of natural disasters, regional unrest and the continuing impact of COVID impacted lives and communities in far-reaching and profound ways. In 2021, Fluor and our employees pledged money to provide critical relief and support to those in need. Donations included emergency relief and resettlement support for more than 7,000 Afghan evacuees and contributions to help victims of tornadoes in the Midwest, wildfires in California and the super typhoon in the Philippines. We also provided more than 865,000 meals as well as clothing and warm blankets for more than 2,700 families around the globe.
