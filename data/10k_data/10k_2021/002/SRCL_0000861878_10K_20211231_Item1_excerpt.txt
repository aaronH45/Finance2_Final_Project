Portfolio Optimization 

On September 1, 2021, we entered into an agreement and completed the sale of our RWCS operations in Japan for proceeds of $11.3 million. Revenues of operations in Japan were approximately 1% of our consolidated annual revenues for 2020, which are reported in International in the RWCS revenue service category.

On December 6, 2021, we entered into an agreement and completed the sale of our Environmental Solutions operations in Canada for proceeds of $24.4 million. Revenues of our Canada Environmental Solutions operations were approximately 1% of our consolidated annual revenues for 2020, which are reported in North America in the RWCS revenue service category.

On December 31, 2021, we acquired a Midwest-based regulated waste business for total purchase consideration of $43.4 million. This acquisition strengthens our independent customer base in North America, allowing us to leverage a strong portfolio of customers to increase overall route density in the Midwest region. The acquired business is anticipated to contribute less than 1% to the RWCS revenue service category for 2022.

Customers

Our service offerings appeal to a wide range of business customers. The majority of our customers are healthcare businesses (hospitals, physician and dental practices, outpatient clinics, long-term care facilities, etc.). We also provide services to retailers, manufacturers, financial services providers, professional services providers, governmental entities and other businesses. Additionally, we expanded into temporary COVID-19 testing and vaccination centers and with our non-health care PPE disposal services into distribution centers and grocery stores. While we manage large volumes of waste and other materials, the average volume per customer site is relatively small.

No single customer accounted for more than 1.5% of our total revenues and our top ten customers collectively accounted for approximately 8.5% of total revenues. No single customer accounted for more than 2.9% of our total accounts receivable and our top ten outstanding customer balances accounted for approximately 10.6% of total accounts receivable. We have developed a strong and loyal customer base, with an estimated revenue retention rate of approximately 90% (based on our internal customer attrition analysis) and have been able to leverage these customer relationships to provide additional services. 

As of December 31, 2021, Regulated Waste and Compliance Services are provided to customers in the U.S., Brazil, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Spain and the U.K. Secure Information Destruction Services under the Shred-it® brand are provided in the U.S., Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Singapore and the U.K. Secure Information Destruction Services are also provided in the United Arab Emirates through a joint venture. 

In the U.S. and elsewhere, the healthcare industry is evolving to meet competing demands for increased healthcare coverage of a growing and aging population and economic pressures to reduce healthcare costs. As a result of these dynamics, hospital networks are consolidating physician practices into their networks, independent practices are consolidating together, while other customers are leveraging GPOs to reduce healthcare costs.

We are headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois.

Our Key Business Priorities

Following its founding in 1989, Stericycle grew rapidly through acquisitions as the regulated waste industry developed. Growth from regulated waste acquisitions helped us achieve scale of infrastructure, route density and a leadership position in many of the markets we serve. We also leveraged acquisitions to enter new regional and international geographies and added additional services to our portfolio. As we grew and evolved, we operated without centralization and the efficiencies that come from an integrated, modern corporate structure and associated information systems until we shifted our focus to our five key business priorities in 2019. 

We have since advanced our transformation focusing our efforts on the following five key business priorities.

•Quality of revenue – The services we offer help our customers meet complex regulations. Our expertise, infrastructure and service levels provide a differentiated and premium brand value to the customers we serve. As such, we are focused on improving the quality of revenue we deliver through customer focus, pricing for value we provide, and standardizing contracts.

•Operational efficiency, modernization, and innovation – Our day-to-day operations are shifting toward a standardized and centralized operating model to optimize processes, drive efficiencies and improve both safety and service. Additionally, our Engineering team is focused on driving cost efficiencies through work measurement, asset optimization, use of technology, enhanced operational and capital planning, and expanded strategic sourcing.

•ERP implementation – Stericycle acquired more than 500 companies without fully integrating certain acquisitions onto centralized information technology platforms. The resulting disparate operating and information systems created significant operational inefficiencies and manual processes. We expect the implementation of the ERP will make it easier for our customers to do business with us, drive improved operating margins through daily decisions using real-time information insights, simplify and enhance financial and operational transparency for greater accountability, aid in strategic planning, and streamline operational processes.

•Debt reduction and leverage improvement – As a result of the debt accumulated from our historic acquisition strategy, debt structure and debt leverage improvement are a key focus as we aim to increase the strength of our balance sheet, continue to invest in our business, and develop a more comprehensive capital allocation strategy. 

•Portfolio optimization – We continue to focus on where our core businesses can be successful geographically. To achieve this, we remain committed to pursuing the divestitures of service lines and geographies that are not as profitable, have limited growth potential, are not vertically integrated, are not essential to our RWCS and SID Revenue categories, and/or present the opportunity to reduce debt. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate growth opportunities for our core business through smaller accretive tuck-in acquisitions.

Regulated Waste and Compliance Services

Collection and Transportation

The collection process for regulated waste streams begins at the customer location with waste segregation. To assure regulatory compliance, we educate our customers and will not accept material from customers unless it complies with our waste acceptance protocols and is properly stored or packaged in containers that we have either supplied or approved and is appropriately labeled.

Our team members then collect containers at the customer location via our fleet of vehicles. The majority of collected waste is then transported directly to one of our processing facilities or to one of our transfer stations until it’s transported to a processing facility. Our use of transfer stations in a "hub and spoke" configuration improves the efficiency of our collection and transportation operations by expanding the geographic area that a particular processing facility can serve, thereby increasing the utilization of the facility and the volume of waste that it processes.

Processing and Disposal of Regulated Waste

Upon arrival at a processing facility, containers or boxes of regulated waste undergo a quality control process to verify that they do not contain any unacceptable substances. Any container or box that is discovered to contain unacceptable waste goes through a corrective action process which could include redirecting the waste, returning the waste to the customer and/or notifying the appropriate regulatory authorities. From there, regulated waste is processed using one of several treatments or processing technologies, predominantly at one of our facilities:

•Autoclaving: Autoclaving is the primary method of regulated waste treatment. This process relies on steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens and render materials non-infectious.

•Alternative Technologies: We use several different non-incineration alternatives to autoclaves, predominantly outside of the U.S. The processes used by these technologies are similar, as the regulated waste is heated to a specified temperature for a required time to kill the pathogens and render materials noninfectious. This is not always under pressure. Depending on local requirements, the waste may be shredded before or after treatment to render it unrecognizable. 

•Incineration: While Stericycle strives to use alternative, non-incineration methods for treating medical waste, incineration remains a regulatory requirement and/or a best practice in certain geographies or for certain types of medical waste that need to be chemically destroyed. Incineration burns regulated waste at elevated temperatures and reduces it to ash. Incineration reduces the volume of waste and it is the recommended treatment and disposal option for some types of regulated waste such as anatomical waste, residues from chemotherapy procedures and non-hazardous pharmaceutical waste. Air emissions from incinerators can contain certain byproducts that are subject to federal, state and in some cases, local regulation. In some circumstances, the ash byproduct of incineration may be regulated. 

Upon completion of the particular treatment process, the resulting waste or incinerator ash is transported for disposal in a landfill owned by unaffiliated third parties. 

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 9

Table of ContentsPART I

In several of our incineration facilities, we use different types of waste-to-energy solutions as part of our processes. Stericycle has four incinerators with steam turbines that are able to generate electricity and reduce the amount of power required from utilities at each site. In the U.K., several of our incinerators export steam to hospitals, where they are co-located, to be used for facility or hot water heating, steam sterilization, and/or laundry services. Similar to exported steam, two of our U.K. incinerators export hot water to nearby hospitals. In the U.K. and Ireland, after medical waste has gone through the alternative treatment process, it is sent for beneficial reuse. This treated waste is sent to cement producers and used as an alternative fuel for cement kilns.

Communication Solutions

Our Communication Solutions provides live voice, online and automated services to assist hospitals and IDNs in scheduling and communicating with their patients. Our platform offers online self-scheduling opportunities for both appointments and classes and events to patients as well as access to live voice agents to assist in the same capacities. Additionally, we offer live voice support for post discharge services, physician referrals, and marketing campaigns. Our automated patient engagement allows for tailored communication to patients over Short Message Service (SMS), email and outbound Interactive Voice Response (IVR) in support of appointment reminders, preparation instructions, office closures, and health and wellness campaigns. 

Providing this service requires information management systems to route calls, store and quickly retrieve live voice protocols or client data, send automated communications, or provide easily accessible reporting and activity details to our customers, all while integrating with our clients' Electronic Health Record (EHRs) and Customer Relationship Management systems. 

Secure Information Destruction

We leverage a combination of off-site and on-site document destruction methods for one-time or recurring paper shredding, x-ray and hard drive destruction. Approximately 70% of collected documents for secure destruction in 2021 were sent off-site to geographic consolidating shredding facilities for secure destruction. The remainder of collected documents are shredded on-site with shredding equipment in our vehicles. For both methods, our service offerings leverage cross-cut shredding technology to enhance the security level of destruction and can provide secure chain-of-custody and Proof of Service. 

Shredded paper is then baled to be sold as SOP for recycling. SOP consists of paper typically generated by offices that contains primarily white paper. It’s a higher value recyclable than mixed paper, old newspapers or magazines. In 2021, Stericycle collected and delivered approximately 529,000 tons of SOP for recycling into paper products. The volume of recycled paper in 2021 is lower year-over-year primarily because of pandemic related impacts. During 2021, the average annual SOP price was $140 per ton, as reported by Fastmarkets RISI, an increase of 25.1% over 2020.

Our Business Model and Key Business Attributes

Regulated Business-to-Business Operations

We focus on providing business-to-business services in areas of operations that are highly regulated. By helping our customers maintain compliance with complex regulations, we protect people and brands, promote health and safeguard the environment. Governmental legislation and regulation require the proper handling and disposal of items such as regulated waste and personal confidential information. Regulated waste can be defined as any material subject to government-imposed guidelines for handling the material for transportation or disposal.

•Regulated Medical Waste: Regulated medical waste generated from procedures including any items saturated with blood or other potentially infectious materials (OPIM), such as bandages, gauze, or PPE, are considered regulated medical waste or red bag waste.

•Trace Chemotherapy Waste: Chemotherapy waste includes empty chemo drug vials, syringes and needles, spill kits, IV tubing and bags, contaminated gloves and gowns, materials from spill cleanups, or bodily fluids/waste.

•Pathological Waste: Pathological waste such as human or animal body parts, organs, tissues, and surgical specimens (decanted of formaldehyde, formalin, or other preservatives) are packaged separately. 

•Sharps Waste: Sharps waste such as needles, scalpels, blades, and pipettes that have come in contact with blood, body fluids, or microorganisms.

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 10

Table of ContentsPART I

•Pharmaceutical Waste: Pharmaceutical waste may be hazardous or nonhazardous and consists of expired, recalled, or otherwise unused pharmaceuticals.

•Controlled Substances Waste: Safely disposing of controlled substances waste immediately after patient administration to mitigate diversion and protect the environment.

•Healthcare Hazardous Waste: Healthcare hazardous waste includes prevalent and well-known waste streams and other wastes generated in smaller quantities that require proper attention, such as flammable liquids, xylene, formalin, aerosols, and universal waste.

•Maritime Waste: Maritime waste include airport and seaport generated waste including gray water, black water, bilge water, sludge, solid waste, recyclable solid waste, RCRA hazardous waste, APHIS waste, and universal waste.

•COVID-19 Waste Disposal: Medical waste and PPE waste generated through the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare and non-healthcare facilities, including vaccine disposal, testing and temporary healthcare sites, and non-healthcare PPE disposal.

•Personal Confidential Information: Personal confidential information includes documents and e-media containing protected healthcare information, financial information, or other confidential information.

Growing Markets

The services we offer, especially our core services of regulated waste and compliance and secure information destruction, are growing or have historically grown prior to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth is driven by multiple factors:

•Aging Population:  The average age of the population in the countries in which we operate is rising, driving increases in healthcare and the quantity of regulated wastes generated.

•Enforcement of Waste Regulations: We operate in a highly regulated business where penalties for violations can be costly and high profile, thereby impacting a business’ overall reputation. We believe that many businesses are unaware either of the need for proper training of employees or of applicable regulatory requirements, and we seek to help businesses fill this gap.

•Regulation of Privacy and Information Security and Concerns over Data Breaches:  The secure information destruction total addressable market has been driven, in part, by the need for compliance with increasing government regulation and increasing general concern with privacy and information security. Recent regulatory changes reflecting this increased regulatory focus include the European GDPR; California, Colorado, and Virginia’s comprehensive consumer privacy legislation; Canada Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act; moreover, the majority of states are working on comprehensive consumer privacy legislation.

•Market Expansion Due to Increased Outsourcing: With regard to Communication Solutions, we believe market growth will come from increased reliance on outsourcing services by those businesses within the marketplace that currently do not use an outside vendor for patient engagement.

•Increased Business Focus on Sustainability:  Businesses continue to realize that a focus on sustainability is increasingly essential to operating efficiently and meeting the increasing demands and expectations of customers and stakeholders for environmental responsibility. Such pressures are driving proper disposal of pharmaceuticals, recycling efforts, shred-all policies for paper and other initiatives supported by our services.

Stable and Recurring Customer Needs Supported by Long-term Contracts

The services we provide most often require service on a routine and scheduled basis. The majority of our customer relationships include long-term contracts ranging from three to five years in length. We have developed a strong and loyal customer base, with a revenue retention rate of approximately 90% (based on our internal customer attrition analysis) in 2021.

Established Network of Processing and Transportation Locations

Our infrastructure network results in an expansive operational network with alternate transportation, treatment and destruction options for our customers. The scale of our network also provides us the ability to be the single-source provider for customers with multiple locations across the country and gives us the flexibility to quickly redirect 

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 11

Table of ContentsPART I

services or operations to another location if the need arises due to severe weather, power outages, or other disruptions. 

In 2021, our Engineering team completed a long-term plan focused on our global facility network. Our goal is to optimize our facilities with a strategic and standardized operating model. We are analyzing processing capabilities, plant and transportation equipment needs, team member requirements, and potential customer implications or benefits. This planning process also provided opportunities to focus on reducing our environmental impact by optimizing our transportation network to reduce miles driven and overall greenhouse gas impact. We anticipate modernizing our plant equipment with new efficient technology that will also lessen our overall energy consumption per operating cycle. In 2021, we opened three new facilities (California, Ireland, and United Kingdom) and completed five autoclave upgrades, representing the initial steps in modernizing our global facility network which we plan to expand in future periods.

Routing Logistics

While we manage large volumes of waste and secure information for destruction, the average volume per customer site is relatively small and the resulting revenue per stop is low. As such, route logistics and route efficiency are a core focus. Our transportation network provides us with an advantage compared to our competition in many of the markets we serve. Additionally, we have continued to focus on route density and optimizing routing at both the individual truck and geographic market level. We expect that the ERP implementation will provide greater visibility to data which will enable routing efficiencies.

Industry Leadership and Expertise

Based on our infrastructure and revenues, we maintain a global leadership position across many of our services lines, including regulated waste and secure information destruction. We have experienced team members who have a deep understanding of the industries they serve, the regulatory climate and the evolving needs of the customers we serve. We collaborate regularly with a wide range of stakeholders and interest groups. In 2014, we were tasked by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to dispose of waste from the Ebola outbreak. Stericycle also provided essential regulated medical waste disposal during the 2003 SARs outbreak and the 2009 H1N1 outbreak. Starting in 2020 and continuing throughout 2021, the Company took a leadership position related to the management of pandemic waste, supporting our customers and providing industry expertise regarding the effective management of COVID-19 waste. We proactively work with organizations like the CDC, DEA, OSHA, EPA and many other government and regulatory bodies, including law enforcement. Our experts are frequent speakers at hospital networks and industry trade associations and actively engage in numerous community meetings each year.

Human Capital Management

Workforce Overview 

As of December 31, 2021, we employed over 15,000 active team members, 97% of which were full-time employees. The efforts and dedication of our team members around the globe enable us to protect what matters each day. Additionally, we have approximately 1,380 global contingent workers supplementing our staff to fill temporary positions or as a part of a temporary-to-permanent recruiting program.

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 12

Table of ContentsPART I

Our voluntary turnover rate for 2021, excluding turnover due to divestitures, averaged approximately 26%, compared to approximately 22% during 2020, directionally consistent with resignation rates in the United States. To ensure best success for recruitment and hiring in North America during 2021, we ended our reliance on third-party recruiting agencies and built an internal strategy and team of experienced talent acquisition professionals. Additionally, we increased advertising investment, which included leveraging new social media campaigns to reach a wider applicant pool, and implemented market-based wage adjustments to bolster recruiting and retention.

At the close of 2021, 12.7% of our total global workforce was covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We are a party to 13 collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. and Canada, covering approximately 500 employees, or approximately 4.6% of our total U.S. and Canadian workforce. We have additional agreements and works councils covering approximately 1,500 employees outside of North America. During 2021, we experienced four work stoppages for a combined total of 83 idle days during which we continued to provide services.

At Stericycle, “We Commit to Safety Always” is one of our core values and a foundational element supporting how we operate as a company. We have developed and continue to focus on improving a comprehensive safety program to protect our team and drive our safety performance.

We have made meaningful advancements in the development and performance of our EHS organization. During 2021, we demonstrated year-over-year improvement in all of our key safety metrics. We remain committed to safety performance improvement and kicked off a multi-faceted Safety Task Force during December 2021 to pursue key safety improvements more aggressively across the organization.

1 Vehicle Incidents includes any incident, regardless of severity involving a vehicle owned, leased or operated by Stericycle, excluding vehicle fires. Data reported for 2020 is different from that presented in Stericycle’s 2020 Form 10-K primarily due to the inclusion of additional countries in which we operate. Stericycle is now able to report vehicle incidents for all but four countries in which we operate.

2 TRIR and LWIR reported for 2020 is different from that presented in Stericycle’s 2020 Form 10-K as the data was normalized for divestitures that occurred in 2021.  

Our safety improvement journey includes a comprehensive focus on centralized procedures, processes and monitoring as well as investment in new training programs to increase safety awareness. During 2021, our safety program expansion included the following: 

•We continued the global expansion of our award-winning SWAT (Steer, Watch, Anticipate and Take Action) defensive driving training; 

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 13

Table of ContentsPART I

•We launched a new, centrally coordinated Global EHS Audit Program focused on conducting comprehensive, unscheduled audits of facility operations. 

•We completed initial Corporate Facility Risk Assessments at all of our operational facilities. This assessment process was developed to analyze ten risk categories to proactively identify and address potential areas of safety and compliance risk.

Diversity and Inclusion 

We are committed to driving engagement and inclusivity to bring out the best in our team and our company.

In 2021, 23% of our global workforce were women with a slightly higher proportion of women holding senior management and middle management roles (31% and 32%, respectively, compared to 29% and 30%, respectively, during 2020). In the U.S., 54% of our team members were from federally designated racial or ethnic minority categories at the close of 2021, compared to 53% in 2020. We are reporting only on U.S. racial and ethnic diversity, as the U.S. is our largest country of operation and because of the complexity of global ethnic and racial diversity reporting given the variations in racial and ethnic designations by country. 

*Based primarily on self-identification at the time of joining Stericycle.

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 14

Table of ContentsPART I

During 2021, approximately 64% of all U.S.-based new hires in 2021 were racial or ethnically diverse, compared to approximately 61% during 2020. When promoting from within, approximately 49% of promotions during 2021 were filled by racially or ethnically diverse individuals, compared to 52% in 2020. Additionally, we hired just over 200 team members during 2021 who identified as U.S. Veterans.

We also encourage and support employee resource groups (ERG) to help drive engagement and representation. We have five employee resource groups supporting women, black or African Americans, Latin Americans, Veterans, and the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) community. We routinely leverage our ERGs to address important social topics with our team members through “Let’s Talk About It” video discussion. Additionally, during 2021, our ERGs provided educational communications to our team members; hosted speaker events; led company celebrations for Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, Pride Month, Asian American and Pacific Islander Month, Veterans Day, and other days of diversity awareness or celebration; and provided mentoring programs for women and veterans.

During 2021, we expanded our on-going market-based compensation analyses to include assessing pay equity factors. We are committed to the ongoing and routine assessment of the competitiveness and equity of our team members’ compensation.

Work-from-Home and Protecting Our Team as the Pandemic Continued

As the COVID-19 pandemic continued in 2021, we continued to monitor best practices as presented by the CDC, OSHA, the DOT, and regulatory agencies around the world for both proper regulated waste management and team member health and safety. We maintained the many numerous protocols introduced during 2020 specifically to reduce the exposure and the potential for spreading of COVID-19 among our front-line, operations team members, including rigorous facility cleaning protocols, use of proper protective equipment, staggered shift times, and dedicated trucks to specific drivers. Most of our administrative and office-based team members continued working from home for all of 2021. Our increased pandemic-related communication efforts designed to keep team members connected became standard operating practice. In addition to COVID-19 safety updates and vaccine information from our EHS team, our ongoing communications included monthly global leadership conference calls to review performance and priorities, weekly video messages from the executive team members, monthly global manager meetings, and leadership development training programs and resources. 

Our Operating Environment

Competition

The industries and markets in which we operate are highly competitive on pricing and barriers to entry are low. Our competitors consist of many different types of service providers, including national, regional and local companies. Some of these companies provide only a portion of the services of Stericycle for example, just collection and transportation, but not treatment of regulated waste or regulated waste compliance services, but not a sharps management program. In the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, another source of competition is on-site management.

For regulated waste, some large-quantity waste generators, particularly hospitals, may choose an onsite autoclave or other treatment process. For secure information destruction, many businesses may choose to use small, on-site shredders for their documents. In both regulated waste and secure information destruction, there is no other competitor in North America with Stericycle’s overall scale, breadth of services, national transportation network and comprehensive treatment network.

Governmental Regulation

Stericycle’s RWCS and SID services are subject to numerous regulations, which are regularly evolving. We are subject to substantial regulations enacted and enforced by governments within the U.S. and the international jurisdictions in which we conduct operations. In many countries there are multiple regulatory agencies at the local and national level that oversee our customers and/or our services. The regulatory requirements with which we must comply, vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws governing our domestic and international operations generally consist of statutes, legislation and regulations concerning environmental protection; employee and public health and safety; transportation; document destruction and management; data privacy; ethical business conduct; and the management of regulated waste streams, including regulations that govern the definition, generation, segregation, handling, packaging, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated waste.

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 15

Table of ContentsPART I

This regulatory framework imposes a variety of compliance requirements, including requirements to obtain and maintain government permits or other authorizations. We maintain governmental permits, registrations and licenses to conduct our business throughout the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our permits vary by jurisdiction based upon our activities within that jurisdiction and on the applicable laws and regulations of that jurisdiction. These permits grant us the authority to, among other things, construct and operate transfer and processing facilities; transport regulated waste within and between relevant jurisdictions; and handle particular regulated substances. Our permits, registrations and licenses may be subject to modification or revocation by the issuing authority and, in some jurisdictions, are subject to periodic renewal. Permit issuance or renewal may also be subject to public participation. 

Various international laws and regulations related to data privacy and the protection of confidential information also apply to Stericycle’s RWCS and SID services, including HIPAA and the CCPA in the U.S. and the GDPR in Europe. In addition, international regulations governing ethical business practices apply to our business, including but not limited to, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Brazilian Clean Companies Act. These laws may apply to our business on both a global and local basis and ban unethical behavior such as the payment of bribes to government officials for the purpose of gaining an improper business advantage, improper maintenance of our books and records, as well as other financial transparency requirements. 

Environmental Protection

Our business is subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations in the geographies in which we operate. Generally, the environmental laws that we are subject to regulate the handling, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste, the release or potential release of hazardous substances into the environment, the discharge of pollutants into waterways and the emission of pollutants into the air. The principal environmental laws that govern our operations in the U.S. are the federal Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, in addition to state laws and regulations governing regulated waste. Examples of environmental laws applicable to our international operations include the Waste Framework Directive, Environmental Liabilities Directive, Industrial Emissions Directive and the Shipments of Waste Regulations in the EU, Lei 12.305/2010 (Lei Ordinária) Institui A Política Nacional De Resíduos Sólidos in Brazil and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and related regulations in Canada.

Employee Health and Welfare

We are subject to numerous regulations promulgated to protect and promote employee health and welfare through the implementation and enforcement of standards designed to prevent illness, injury and death in the workplace. The primary U.S. federal laws relating to employee health and welfare applicable to our business are overseen by OSHA, which establishes specific employer responsibilities including engineering controls, administrative controls, training, policies and programs complying with the regulations and recordkeeping and reporting, all in an effort to ensure a safe workplace. Various OSHA standards apply to almost all aspects of our operations and govern such matters as exposure to blood-borne pathogens, hazard communication, and personal and protective equipment.

Examples of employee health and welfare laws applicable to our international operations include the European Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (Directive 89/391 EEC) and various provisions of the Canada Labour Code and related occupational safety and health regulations in the provinces and territories of Canada.

Transportation

Various laws regulating the transportation of waste and other potentially hazardous materials also apply to the services we provide. In the U.S., the DOT has established regulations which deal with two different aspects of transportation: hazardous materials transport and safety in transportation. These regulations are defined within the PHMSA and the FMCSA. We are regularly subject to roadside inspections. These inspections have a cumulative effect on our compliance history and require us to remain in good standing so as not to jeopardize our permits.

Examples of transportation laws applicable to our international operations include the Directive on the Inland Transportation of Dangerous Goods in the EU, and the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act, and related regulations in Canada, and globally the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code, and the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations.

Controlled Substances

Our service offerings for the treatment and disposal of controlled substance pharmaceutical waste, from both the healthcare industry and individual consumers, are subject to numerous laws and regulations governed by various 

2021 10-K Annual ReportStericycle, Inc. • 16

Table of ContentsPART I

regulatory agencies, including the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). These regulations typically require facilities to obtain licenses or registrations, and meet other certain obligations for approval to collect, transport, treat and dispose of pharmaceutical waste containing controlled substances. These regulations can have very prescriptive requirements for security, recordkeeping and reporting. Like other regulatory schemes, registrations/licenses must be kept current, and facilities may be subject to inspection or enforcement.

U.S. and Foreign Local Regulation for Waste Management

We conduct business in all 50 U.S. States and Puerto Rico. Because the EPA does not promulgate regulations for regulated waste at a national level, each state has its own regulations related to the handling, treatment and storage of regulated waste. Many states have followed requirements similar to the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 or have placed regulated waste regulations under solid waste regulations. Regulated garbage (sometimes referred to as “APHIS waste” taken from the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service) is another area of regulatory requirements we are subject to pursuant to regulations promulgated by the USDA and U.S. Custom and Border Protection. The USDA typically inspects our facilities receiving such APHIS waste on a quarterly basis.

In each state where we operate a processing facility or a transfer station, we are required to comply with varying state and local laws and regulations which may also require a specific operating plan. In addition, many local governments have ordinances and regulations, such as zoning or wastewater regulations that affect our operations. Similarly, our international operations are subject to regulations enacted and enforced at the provincial, municipal, and local levels of government in addition to the national regulations with which we must comply.

Insurance and Self-Insurance

The regulated waste industry involves potentially significant risks of statutory, contractual, tort and common law liability claims. Potential liability claims could involve, for example: cleanup costs, personal injury, damage to the environment, employee matters, property damage, or alleged negligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of work.

We also could be subject to fines or penalties in connection with violations of regulatory requirements.

We carry several insurance coverages including property, workers compensation, general liability, employer’s liability, pollution liability, privacy and security liability, event management, cyber-liability, directors and officers and miscellaneous professional services errors and omissions coverages. We also carry umbrella policies that cover general liability, automobile and employers liability. We regularly evaluate other lines of coverage to respond to specific business needs but consider our current insurance coverage to be sufficient to meet regulatory as well as customer requirements and to protect our employees, assets and operations.
