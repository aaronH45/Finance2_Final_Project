PART I

Item 1. Business.

General

Founded in 1967 by Mr. Ralph Lauren, we are a global leader in the design, marketing, and distribution of premium lifestyle products, including apparel, footwear, accessories, home furnishings, fragrances, and hospitality. For more than 50 years, Ralph Lauren has sought to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. Our long-standing reputation and distinctive image have been developed across a wide range of products, brands, distribution channels, and international markets. We believe that our global reach, breadth of lifestyle product offerings, and multi-channel distribution are unique among luxury and apparel companies.

We diversify our business by geography (North America, Europe, and Asia, among other regions) and channel of distribution (retail, wholesale, and licensing). This allows us to maintain a dynamic balance as our operating results do not depend solely on the performance of any single geographic area or channel of distribution. We sell directly to consumers through our integrated retail channel, which includes our retail stores, concession-based shop-within-shops, and digital commerce operations around the world. Our wholesale sales are made principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners around the world, as well as to certain third-party-owned stores to which we have licensed the right to operate in defined geographic territories using our trademarks. In addition, we license to third parties for specified periods the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings.

We organize our business into the following three reportable segments: North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition to these reportable segments, we also have other non-reportable segments. See "Our Segments" for further discussion of our segment reporting structure.

Our global reach is extensive, as we sell directly to customers throughout the world via our 504 retail stores and 684 concession-based shop-within-shops, as well as through our own digital commerce sites and those of various third-party digital partners. Merchandise is also available through our wholesale distribution channels at approximately 9,000 doors worldwide,

the majority in specialty stores, as well as through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers. In addition to our directly-operated stores and shops, our international licensing partners operate 148 stores and shops.

We have been controlled by the Lauren family since the founding of our Company. As of April 2, 2022, Mr. R. Lauren, or entities controlled by the Lauren family, held approximately 85% of the voting power of the Company's outstanding common stock.

Objectives and Opportunities

Our purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that our size and the global scope of our operations provide us with design, sourcing, and distribution synergies across our business. Our core strengths include a portfolio of global premium lifestyle brands, a well-diversified global multi-channel distribution network, an investment philosophy supported by a strong balance sheet, and an experienced management team. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment, as discussed further in Item 7 — "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Global Economic Conditions and Industry Trends," we believe our core strengths will allow us to execute our long-term growth strategy.

An overview of our long-term growth strategy is presented below:

Global Citizenship and Sustainability

Global citizenship and sustainability at Ralph Lauren is rooted in the heritage of our brand and our purpose to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. We believe that delivering the next 50 years for Ralph Lauren means rethinking our impact on the environment and society and utilizing creativity, the power of design, and innovative technologies to drive meaningful change. We call our citizenship and sustainability plan "Design the Change," and through this strategy, we’re creating a more sustainable future in three key areas:

1.Create Timeless Style

•Responsible Design — We commit to embedding sustainability, inclusivity, intention, and celebration into the products and services we design. 

•Circularity — We are committed to a comprehensive circular strategy, whereby we will inform our product development and support more circular systems in our industry by designing out waste and pollution, keeping products and materials in use, and regenerating natural systems. 

•Sustainable Materials — We commit to using more materials in a way that results in positive social and environmental outcomes, protects biodiversity, advances animal welfare, and continuously improves traceability of our raw materials.

•Sustainable Spaces — We are committed to designing and building Ralph Lauren stores with materials that minimize environmental impact and maximize occupant health.

•Chemical Management — We commit to monitor and reduce hazardous chemical use and discharge and we are working to eliminate all hazardous chemicals from our product manufacturing. 

2.Protect the Environment

•Carbon and Energy — We are committed to playing our part to address the climate crisis by reducing greenhouse gas emissions across our value chain and investing in credible emission removals.

•Water Stewardship — We commit to reducing water consumption across our value chain and to safeguarding and preserving water resources in our communities.

•Waste Management — We commit to integrating zero-waste principles across our business, focusing on reducing waste at its source and diverting waste from landfill through increased recycling and upcycling.

•Sustainable Packaging — We commit to our packaging material being recyclable, reusable, or sustainably sourced. 

3.Champion Better Lives

•Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion — We unite and inspire the communities within our Company, as well as those we serve, by amplifying voices and perspectives to create a culture of belonging, equality, inclusion, and fairness for all.

•Community Engagement and Philanthropy — We commit to making a meaningful difference in our communities through our global employee volunteerism and our dedication to social and environmental causes.

•Worker Empowerment and Well-being — We are committed to conducting our global operations ethically and with respect for the dignity of all people who make our products. We aim to enrich the quality of work and life for everyone in our supply chain, ensuring they all have the opportunity to reach their full potential in a safe and inclusive environment.

Recent Developments

COVID-19 Pandemic

Beginning in the fourth quarter of our Fiscal 2020, a novel strain of coronavirus commonly referred to as COVID-19 emerged and spread rapidly across the globe, including throughout all major geographies in which we operate, resulting in adverse economic conditions and business disruptions, as well as significant volatility in global financial markets. Since then, governments worldwide have periodically imposed varying degrees of preventative and protective actions, such as temporary travel bans, forced business closures, and stay-at-home orders, all in an effort to reduce the spread of the virus. Such factors, among others, have resulted in a significant decline in retail traffic, tourism, and consumer spending on discretionary items. Additionally, companies across a wide array of industries have implemented various initiatives to reduce operating expenses and preserve cash balances during the pandemic, including work furloughs, reduced pay, and severance actions, which could lower consumers' disposable income levels or willingness to purchase discretionary items. Such government restrictions, company initiatives, and other macroeconomic impacts resulting from the pandemic could continue to adversely affect consumer behavior, spending levels, and/or shopping preferences, such as willingness to congregate in indoor shopping centers or other populated locations.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced varying degrees of business disruptions and periods of closure of our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities, as have our wholesale customers, licensing partners, suppliers, and vendors. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2021 at the peak of the pandemic, the majority of our stores in key markets were closed for an average of 8 to 10 weeks due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions, resulting in significant adverse impacts to our operating results. Resurgences and outbreaks in certain parts of the world resulted in further business disruptions periodically throughout Fiscal 2021, most notably in Europe where a significant number of our stores were closed for approximately two to three months during the second half of Fiscal 2021, including during the holiday period, due to government-mandated lockdowns and other restrictions. Such disruptions continued throughout Fiscal 2022 in certain regions, although to a lesser extent than the comparable prior year fiscal period. Further, throughout the course of the pandemic, the majority of our stores that were able to remain open have periodically been subject to limited operating hours and/or customer capacity levels in accordance with local health guidelines, with traffic remaining challenged. However, our digital commerce operations have grown significantly from pre-pandemic levels, due in part to our investments and enhanced capabilities, as well as changes in consumer shopping preferences. Our wholesale and licensing businesses have experienced similar impacts, particularly in North America and Europe.

The COVID-19 pandemic also continues to adversely impact our distribution, logistic, and sourcing partners, including temporary factory closures, labor shortages, vessel, container and other transportation shortages, and port congestion. Such disruptions have reduced the availability of inventory, delayed timing of inventory receipts, and resulted in increased costs for the both the purchase and transportation of such inventory.

Throughout the course of the pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate around the world. We continue to consider the guidance of local governments and global health organizations and have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate facilities. We also took various preemptive actions in the prior fiscal year to preserve cash and strengthen our liquidity position, as described in the Fiscal 2021 10-K. Such actions included, but were not limited to, issuing $1.250 billion of unsecured senior notes, temporarily suspending our quarterly cash dividend and common stock repurchase programs, temporarily reducing the base compensation of our executives and senior management team, and temporarily furloughing or reducing work hours for a significant portion of our employees.

Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines and improvements in the global economy as a whole during Fiscal 2022, the pandemic remains volatile and continues to evolve, including the emergence of variants of the virus, such as the Delta and Omicron variants, which has and could continue to adversely affect consumer sentiment and confidence. Accordingly, we cannot predict for how long and to what extent the pandemic will continue to impact our business operations or the overall global economy. We will continue to assess our operations location-by-location, considering the guidance of local governments and global health organizations. 

See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business" for additional discussion regarding risks to our business associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan

We have undertaken efforts to realign our resources to support future growth and profitability, and to create a sustainable, enhanced cost structure. The key initiatives underlying these efforts involve evaluation of our: (i) team organizational structures and ways of working; (ii) real estate footprint and related costs across our corporate offices, distribution centers, and direct-to-consumer retail and wholesale doors; and (iii) brand portfolio.

In connection with the first initiative, on September 17, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan") to reduce our global workforce. Additionally, during a preliminary review of our store portfolio during the second quarter of Fiscal 2021, we made the decision to close our Polo store on Regent Street in London. 

Shortly thereafter, on October 29, 2020, we announced the planned transition of our Chaps brand to a fully licensed business model, consistent with our long-term brand elevation strategy and in connection with our third initiative. Specifically, we have entered into a multi-year licensing partnership, which took effect on August 1, 2021 following a transition period, with an affiliate of 5 Star Apparel LLC, a division of the OVED Group, to manufacture, market, and distribute Chaps menswear and womenswear. The products are being sold at existing channels of distribution with opportunities for expansion into additional channels and markets globally. This agreement has created incremental value for the Company by enabling an even greater focus on elevating our core brands in the marketplace, reducing our direct exposure to the North America department store channel, and setting up Chaps to deliver on its potential with an experienced partner that is focused on nurturing the brand.

Later, on February 3, 2021, our Board of Directors approved additional actions related to our real estate initiative. Specifically, we are in the process of further rightsizing and consolidating our global corporate offices to better align with our organizational profile and new ways of working. We also have closed, and may continue to close, certain of our stores to improve overall profitability. Additionally, we further consolidated our North America distribution centers in order to drive greater efficiencies, improve sustainability, and deliver a better consumer experience.

Finally, on June 26, 2021, in connection with our brand portfolio initiative, we sold our former Club Monaco business to Regent, L.P. ("Regent"), a global private equity firm, with no resulting gain or loss on sale realized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. Regent acquired Club Monaco's assets and liabilities in exchange for potential future cash consideration payable to us, including earn-out payments based on Club Monaco meeting certain defined revenue thresholds over a five-year period. Accordingly, we may realize amounts in the future related to the receipt of such contingent consideration. Additionally, in connection with this divestiture, we are providing Regent with certain operational support for a transitional period of approximately one year, varying by functional area. 

In connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan, we have recorded cumulative pre-tax charges of $262.1 million, of which $25.3 million and $236.8 million were recorded during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively. Actions associated with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Realignment Plan were substantially completed by the end of Fiscal 2022, with certain remaining actions expected to be completed during Fiscal 2023. We now expect total charges of up to $300 million to be incurred in connection with this plan, consisting of cash-related charges of approximately $180 million and non-cash charges of approximately $120 million. Actions associated with this plan are expected to result in gross annualized pre-tax expense savings of approximately $200 million, a portion of which is being reinvested back into the business.

See Note 9 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding charges recorded in connection with the Fiscal 2021 Strategic Restructuring Plan.

The terms of trade for shop-within-shops are largely conducted on a concession basis, whereby inventory continues to be owned by us (not the department store) until ultimate sale to the end consumer.

Our Wholesale Business

Our wholesale business sells our products globally primarily to major department stores, specialty stores, and golf and pro shops, as well as to various third-party digital partners.

As of the end of Fiscal 2022, our wholesale products were sold through approximately 9,000 doors worldwide, with the majority in specialty stores. Our products are also increasingly being sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our traditional wholesale customers and our third-party digital partners.

In North America, our wholesale business is comprised primarily of sales to department stores, and to a lesser extent, specialty stores.

During Fiscal 2022, sales to our three largest wholesale customers accounted for approximately 16% of our total net revenues.

Our products are sold primarily by our own sales forces. Our wholesale business maintains its primary showrooms in New York City, as well as regional showrooms in London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, Paris, and Stockholm. In addition, we utilize virtual showrooms, allowing our customers to experience and discover our product assortments in a retail setting remotely.

We normally share in the cost of building out these shop-within-shops with our wholesale customers. 

Replenishment Program. Core products such as knit shirts, chino pants, oxford cloth shirts, select footwear and accessories, and home products can be ordered by our wholesale customers at any time through our replenishment program. We generally ship these products within two to five days of order receipt.

Backlog. We generally receive wholesale orders approximately three to five months prior to the time the products are delivered to customers, except for orders received through our replenishment program which ship within two to five days of order receipt. Our wholesale orders are generally subject to broad cancellation rights. Further, the size of our order backlog depends on several factors, including the timing of the market weeks for our particular lines during which a significant percentage of our orders are received and the timing of shipments, which varies from year-to-year with consideration for holidays, consumer trends, concept plans, and the replenishment program's usage. Consequently, the dollar amount of our backlog as of any date may not be indicative of actual future shipments and therefore is not meaningful in understanding our business as a whole.

Our Licensing Business

Through licensing alliances, we combine our consumer insight, design, and marketing skills with the specific product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and build new businesses. We generally seek out licensing partners who are leaders in their respective markets, contribute the majority of product development costs, provide the operational infrastructure required to support the business, and own the inventory. Our licensing business has been aggregated with other non-reportable segments.

Product Licensing

We grant our product licensees the right to access our various trademarks in connection with the licensees' manufacture and sale of designated products, such as certain apparel, eyewear, fragrances, and home furnishings. Each product licensing partner pays us royalties based upon its sales of our products, generally subject to a minimum royalty requirement for the right to use our trademarks and design services. In addition, our licensing partners may be required to allocate a portion of their revenues to advertising our products and sharing in the creative costs associated with these products. Larger allocations typically are required in connection with launches of new products or in new territories. Our license agreements generally have two to five-year terms and may grant the licensees conditional renewal options.

We work closely with all of our licensing partners to ensure that their products are developed, marketed, and distributed to reach the intended consumer and are presented consistently across product categories to convey the distinctive identity and lifestyle associated with our brands. Virtually all aspects of the design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising, and promotion of Ralph Lauren products are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight. We perform a broader range of services for most of our Ralph Lauren Home licensing partners than we do for our other licensing partners, including design, operating showrooms, marketing, and advertising.

The following table lists our largest licensing agreements as of April 2, 2022 for the product categories presented. Except as noted in the table, these product licenses cover North America only. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

International Licensing

Our international licensing partners acquire the right to sell, promote, market, and/or distribute various categories of our products in a given geographic area and source products from us, our product licensing partners, and independent sources. International licensees' rights may include the right to own and operate retail stores. As of April 2, 2022, our international licensing partners operated 148 stores and shops.

Digital Ecosystem

Investing in our digital ecosystem remains a primary focus and is a key component of our integrated global omni-channel strategy that spans across owned and partnered channels, both physical and digital. Our digital ecosystem is comprised of directly-operated platforms, wholesale partner websites, third-party digital pure players, social commerce, and virtual economy platforms.

Our directly-operated digital commerce sites represent our digital flagships, featuring the most elevated expression of our brands. The strategy for our digital flagships is to deliver distinct and immersive brand experiences, continuously enhance consumer experience, and develop digital content that drives deeper consumer engagement and conversion. Our physical flagships are also brought to life in a digital format through our virtual store experience, allowing consumers to experience our brands and product assortments in a way that was previously only possible by walking into our stores. In connection with our long-term growth strategy, we also continue to scale and expand our Connected Retail capabilities to enhance the consumer experience, which now include virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store, and mobile checkout and contactless payments, among other capabilities.

Our products are also sold through the digital commerce sites of many of our wholesale customers across the globe. With all partners in our ecosystem, we seek to showcase the brand consistently with our values. We collaborate with our key wholesale customers to deliver the right content to the right audience, and leverage consumer insights to develop a holistic, channel-agnostic view of our consumer.

We also sell our products online through various third-party digital pure-play sites to reach a broader audience of consumers, including younger consumers, and amplify our brand messages. On many of these sites, we have created digital shop-in-shop environments with a consistent brand experience, tailored product stories, and an assortment that is carefully curated by our merchants. We also partner closely with our pure-play customers on marketing content and events, as well as optimizing search and other data analyses to drive higher traffic and conversion for our brands. 

In connection with our digital commerce operations, we engage consumers through various digital and social media platforms, which are supported through our collaboration with influencers who have an authentic connection to our brand. Ralph Lauren brands are also represented in several virtual economy platforms, providing digital apparel offerings and virtual brand experiences in the metaverse that attract younger consumers. 

Seasonality of Business

Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of retail sales in our second and third fiscal quarters and higher wholesale sales in our second and fourth fiscal quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of key vacation travel, back-to-school, and holiday shopping periods impacting our retail business and timing of seasonal wholesale shipments. As a result of changes in our business, consumer spending patterns, and the macroeconomic environment, including those resulting from pandemic diseases and other catastrophic events, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of our future performance. In addition, fluctuations in sales, operating income, and cash flows in any fiscal quarter may be affected by other events affecting retail sales, such as changes in weather patterns.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital requirements typically increase during the first half of the fiscal year as inventory builds to support peak shipping/selling periods and, accordingly, typically decrease during the second half of the fiscal year as inventory is shipped/sold. Cash provided by operating activities is typically higher in the second half of the fiscal year due to reduced working capital requirements during that period.

Product Design

Our products reflect a timeless and innovative interpretation of American style with a strong international appeal. Our consistent emphasis on new and distinctive design has been an important contributor to the prominence, strength, and reputation of the Ralph Lauren brands.

Our Ralph Lauren products are designed by, and under the direction of, Mr. Ralph Lauren and our design staff. We form design teams around our brands and product categories to develop concepts, themes, and products for each brand and category. Through close collaboration with merchandising, sales, and product management staff, these teams support all of our businesses in order to gain market information and other valuable input.

15

Marketing and Advertising

Our marketing and advertising programs communicate the themes and images of our brands and are integral to the success of our product offerings. The majority of our advertising programs are created and executed by our in-house creative and advertising agency to ensure consistency of presentation, which is complemented by our marketing experts in each region who help to execute our international strategies.

We create distinctive image advertising for our brands, conveying the particular message of each one within the context of the overall Ralph Lauren aesthetic. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item and include a variety of products offered by us and, in some cases, our licensing partners. Our communication campaigns are increasingly being executed through digital and social media platforms to drive further engagement with the younger consumer. With regard to influencers, we believe in fostering long-term relationships with those who have an authentic connection to our brand and influence the areas of culture that matter most to our audiences. We also continue to advertise through print and outdoor media, and, to a lesser extent, through television and cinema. 

Our digital advertising programs focus on high impact and innovative digital media outlets, which allow us to convey our key brand messages and lifestyle positioning. We also develop digital editorial initiatives that allow for deeper education and engagement around the Ralph Lauren lifestyle. We deploy these marketing and advertising initiatives through online, mobile, video, email, and social media. Our digital commerce sites present the Ralph Lauren lifestyle online, while offering a broad array of our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home product lines.

Additionally, we advertise in consumer and trade publications, and participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with some of our retail and licensing partners. We have outdoor advertising placements in key cities as well, focusing on impact and reach. We also provide point-of-sale fixtures and signage to our wholesale customers to enhance the presentation of our products at their retail locations. In addition, when our licensing partners are required to spend an amount equal to a percentage of their licensed product sales on advertising, in certain cases we coordinate the advertising placement on their behalf. We believe our investments in shop-within-shop environments and retail stores, including our global flagship locations, contribute to and enhance the themes of our brands to consumers.

We also conduct a variety of public relations activities. For example, we typically introduce each of our spring and fall menswear and womenswear collections at press presentations in major cities such as New York City and Milan. Such fashion events, in addition to celebrity red carpet dressing moments and events hosted in our stores and restaurants, including The Polo Bar in New York City, generate extensive domestic and international media and social coverage.

We are the official outfitter for all on-court officials at the Wimbledon, U.S. Open, and Australian Open tennis tournaments. These tournaments provide worldwide exposure for our brand in a relevant lifestyle environment. We also continue to be the exclusive Official Parade Outfitter for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Teams, with the right to manufacture, distribute, advertise, promote, and sell products in the U.S. which replicate the Parade Outfits and associated leisure wear. Most recently, we dressed Team U.S.A. for the Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, China in 2022 and the Summer Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan in 2021. As part of our involvement with Team U.S.A., we have established a partnership with athletes serving as brand ambassadors and as the faces of our advertising, marketing, and public relations campaigns. We are also the official apparel outfitter for the Professional Golfers' Association ("PGA") of America, the PGA Championship, the U.S. Golf Association, and the U.S. Ryder Cup Team, as well as a partner of the American Junior Golf Association. We sponsor a roster of professional golfers, including Billy Horschel, Andrea Lee, Nick Watney, Smylie Kaufman, Tom Watson, Davis Love III, Jonathan Byrd, and Doc Redman. 

We believe our partnerships with such prestigious global athletic events reinforce our brand's sporting heritage in a truly authentic way and serve to connect our Company and brands to our consumers through their individual areas of passion.

Sourcing, Production and Quality

We contract for the manufacture of our products and do not own or operate any production facilities. Over 300 different manufacturers worldwide produce our apparel, footwear, accessories, and home products, with no one manufacturer providing more than 6% of our total production during Fiscal 2022. We source both finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, and other trim. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers. In Fiscal 2022, approximately 97% of our products (by dollar value) were produced outside of the U.S., primarily in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, with approximately 19% of our products sourced from China and another 19% from Vietnam. See "Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations," Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions — Economic conditions could have a negative impact on our major customers, suppliers, 

16

vendors, and lenders, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business," and Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."

Most of our businesses must commit to the manufacturing of our garments before we sell finished goods, whether to wholly-owned retail stores or to wholesale customers. We also must commit to the purchase of fabric from mills well in advance of our sales. If we overestimate our primary customers' demand for a particular product or the need for a particular fabric or yarn, we primarily sell the excess products or garments made from such fabric or yarn in our factory stores or through other secondary distribution channels.

Suppliers operate under the close supervision of our global manufacturing division. All products are produced according to our specifications and standards. Production and quality control staff in Asia, the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe monitor manufacturing at supplier facilities in order to correct problems prior to shipment of the final product. Procedures have been implemented under our vendor certification and compliance programs so that quality assurance is reviewed early in the production process, allowing merchandise to be received at the distribution facilities and shipped to customers with minimal interruption.

Competition

Competition is very strong in the segments of the fashion and consumer product industries in which we operate. We compete with numerous designers and manufacturers of apparel, footwear, accessories, fragrances, and home furnishing products, both domestic and international. We also face increasing competition from companies selling our product categories through the Internet. Some of our competitors may be significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than us. We compete primarily on the basis of fashion, quality, value, and service, which depend on our ability to:

•anticipate and respond to changing consumer demands and shopping preferences, including the ever-increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communications, and online and cross-channel shopping;

•create and maintain favorable brand recognition, loyalty, and reputation for quality, including through digital brand engagement and online and social media presence;

•develop and produce innovative, high-quality products that appeal to consumers of varying age groups;

•competitively price our products and create an acceptable value proposition for consumers;

•provide strong and effective marketing support, including through digital and social media platforms in order to stay better connected to consumers;

•provide attractive, reliable, secure, and user-friendly digital commerce sites;

•obtain sufficient retail floor space, and effectively present our products to consumers;

•attract consumer traffic to stores, shop-within-shops, and digital commerce sites;

•source sustainable raw materials at cost-effective prices;

•anticipate and maintain proper inventory levels;

•ensure product availability and optimize supply chain and distribution efficiencies;

•maintain and grow market share;

•recruit and retain employees to operate our retail stores, distribution centers, and various corporate functions;

•protect our intellectual property; and

•withstand prolonged periods of adverse economic conditions or business disruptions. 

See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — We face intense competition worldwide in the markets in which we operate."

Distribution

To facilitate global distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to a network of distribution centers around the world for inspection, sorting, packing, and delivery to our retail locations and digital commerce and wholesale customers. This network includes the following primary distribution facilities:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam.

All facilities are designed to allow for high-density cube storage and value-added services, and utilize unit and carton tracking technology to facilitate process control and inventory management. The distribution network is managed through globally integrated information technology systems.

Information Systems 

Our information systems facilitate business processes, consumer experiences, and decision-making support across the Company and our extended ecosystem of manufacturers, vendors, business partners, and customers. Our system applications are connected to support the flow of information across functions, including:

•product design, sourcing, and production;

•comprehensive order processing, fulfillment, and distribution;

•retail store and digital commerce operations;

•marketing and advertising;

•financial accounting and management reporting; and

•human resources.

Our retail operation systems, including point-of-sale registers and merchandising, planning, and inventory management systems, support operational processes within our store network and link with our digital commerce processes to support omni-channel capabilities. 

We are continually improving and upgrading our computer systems and software. For example, during Fiscal 2022, we continued to transform our value chain processes and technology to support advanced global capabilities for our supply and demand management solutions. In Fiscal 2022, we also continued to accelerate our advanced analytics capabilities across functions. We are also continually enhancing the consumer experience by adding new functionality to our direct-to-consumer channels, including new Connected Retail capabilities, which now include virtual selling appointments, Buy Online-Pick Up in Store, and mobile checkout and contactless payments, among other capabilities.

We have a longstanding information security risk program structured according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, industry best practices, privacy legislation, and other global and local standards and regulations. This program includes a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of security controls, including network segmentation, security monitoring, endpoint protection, and identity and access management, as well as data loss prevention controls. Our Audit Committee is updated on the overall performance of our information security risk program on a quarterly basis. 

18

Our cybersecurity awareness programs include phishing simulations, general cybersecurity awareness, and data protection modules, as well as more contextual and personalized modules for targeted users and roles. We incorporate external expertise and guidance in all aspects of our program. We leverage cybersecurity specialists to complete external audits and objective assessments of our cybersecurity program and practices, as well as to conduct targeted attack simulations. We continually enhance our information security capabilities in order to protect against emerging threats, while also increasing our ability to detect and respond to cyber incidents and maximize our resilience to recover from potential cyber-attacks. We have a robust incident response plan in place that provides a documented runbook for handling high severity cybersecurity incidents and facilitates coordination across multiple parts of our Company. We also routinely perform simulations and drills at both a technical and leadership level. Additionally, we have purchased network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection, should a data breach occur. 

See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Systems and Data Security — A data security or privacy breach could damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to litigation risk, and adversely affect our business" and "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Information Systems and Data Security — Our business could suffer if our computer systems and websites are disrupted or cease to operate effectively."

Wholesale Credit Control

We manage our own credit function. We sell our merchandise principally to major department stores, specialty stores, and third-party digital partners, and extend credit based on an evaluation of the wholesale customer's financial capacity and condition, usually without requiring collateral. We monitor credit levels and the financial condition of our wholesale customers on a continuing basis to minimize credit risk. We do not factor or underwrite our accounts receivables, nor do we maintain credit insurance to manage the risk of bad debts. In North America, collection and deduction transactional activities are provided through a third-party service provider. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a limited number of large wholesale customers. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of consolidations, liquidations, restructurings, other ownership changes in the retail industry, and/or any financial instability of our large wholesale customers."

Trademarks

We own the RALPH LAUREN, POLO, POLO RALPH LAUREN, and the famous Polo Player Design trademarks in the U.S. and over 120 countries worldwide. Other trademarks that we own include:

•PURPLE LABEL;

•DOUBLE RL;

•RRL & DESIGN;

•RLX;

•RL;

•LAUREN RALPH LAUREN;

•PINK PONY;

•LAUREN;

•RALPH;

•POLO BEAR;

•CHAPS; and

•Various other trademarks.

Mr. Ralph Lauren has the royalty-free right to use as trademarks RALPH LAUREN, DOUBLE RL, and RRL in perpetuity in connection with, among other things, beef and living animals. The trademarks DOUBLE RL and RRL are currently used by the Double RL Company, an entity wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. In addition, Mr. R. Lauren has the right to engage in personal projects involving film or theatrical productions (not including or relating to our business) through RRL Productions, Inc., a company wholly owned by Mr. R. Lauren. Any activity by these companies has no impact on us.

19

Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of items of apparel, apparel-related products and accessories, home furnishings, restaurant and café services, online services and online publications, and beauty products, as well as in connection with retail services, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks are used in connection with the related products and services and the required registration renewals are filed. We regard the license to use the trademarks and our other proprietary rights in and to the trademarks as extremely valuable assets in marketing our products and, on a worldwide basis, vigorously seek to protect them against infringement. As a result of the appeal of our trademarks, our products have been the object of counterfeiting. While we have a broad enforcement program which has been generally effective in protecting our intellectual property rights and limiting the sale of counterfeit products in the U.S. and in most major markets abroad, we face greater challenges with respect to enforcing our rights against trademark infringement in certain parts of Asia.

In markets outside of the U.S., our rights to some or all of our trademarks may not be clearly established. Over the course of our international expansion, we have experienced conflicts with various third parties who have acquired ownership rights in certain trademarks, including POLO and/or a representation of a Polo Player Design, which impede our use and registration of our principal trademarks. While such conflicts are common and may arise again from time to time as we continue our international expansion, we have, in general, successfully resolved such conflicts in the past through both legal action and negotiated settlements with third-party owners of the conflicting marks (see Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected outside the U.S." and Item 3 — "Legal Proceedings" for further discussion). Although we have not suffered any material restraints or restrictions on doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce trademarks to new markets.

Import Restrictions and Other Government Regulations

Virtually all of our merchandise imported into the Americas, Europe, Asia, Australia, and New Zealand is subject to duties. In addition, most of the countries to which we ship could impose safeguard quotas and duties to protect their local industries from import surges that threaten to create market disruption. The U.S. and other countries may also unilaterally impose additional duties in response to a particular product being imported (from China or other countries) at unfairly traded prices in such increased quantities that would cause (or threaten) injury to the relevant domestic industry (generally known as "anti-dumping" actions). If dumping is suspected in the U.S., the U.S. government may self-initiate a dumping case on behalf of the U.S. textile industry which could significantly affect our costs. Furthermore, additional duties, generally known as countervailing duties, can also be imposed by the U.S. government to offset subsidies provided by a foreign government to foreign manufacturers if the importation of such subsidized merchandise injures or threatens to injure a U.S. industry.

In addition, each of the countries in which our products are sold has laws and regulations covering imports. Because the U.S. and the other countries in which our products are manufactured and sold may, from time to time, impose new duties, tariffs, surcharges, or other import controls or restrictions, or adjust presently prevailing duty or tariff rates or levels, we maintain a program of intensive monitoring of import restrictions and opportunities. We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import-related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers, and through geographical diversification of our sources of supply.

As almost all of our products are manufactured by foreign suppliers, the enactment of new legislation or the administration of current international trade regulations or executive action affecting textile agreements, or changes in sourcing patterns could adversely affect our operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to Regulatory, Legal, and Tax Matters — Our ability to conduct business globally may be affected by a variety of legal, regulatory, political, and economic risks" and "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products and the ability of our manufacturers to produce our goods on time and to our specifications."

We are also subject to other international trade agreements, such as the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Central American Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade Agreement, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement and other special trade preference programs. A portion of our imported products are eligible for certain of these duty-advantaged programs. 

Apparel and other products sold by us are under the jurisdiction of multiple governmental agencies, including, in the U.S., the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Consumer Products Safety Commission. Our products are also subject to regulation in the U.S. and other countries, including the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which relate principally to product labeling, licensing requirements, and consumer product safety requirements and regulatory testing, particularly with respect to products used by children. Any failure 

20

to comply with such requirements could result in significant penalties and require us to recall products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, local, and foreign rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment. Our licensed products, licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, and the vendors and factories with which we contract for the manufacture and distribution of our products are also subject to regulation. Our agreements require our licensing partners, buying/sourcing agents, vendors, and factories to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results.

We are also subject to disclosure and reporting requirements, established under existing or new federal or state laws, such as the requirements to identify the origin and existence of certain "conflict minerals" under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and disclosures of specific actions to eradicate abusive labor practices in our supply chain under the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act. While we require our suppliers to operate in compliance with all applicable laws and our operating guidelines which promote ethical and socially responsible business practices, any violation of labor, environmental, health, and safety or other laws, or any divergence by an independent supplier's labor practices from generally accepted industry standards, could damage our reputation, disrupt our sourcing capabilities, and increase the cost of doing business, adversely affecting our results of operations. See Item 1A — "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations — Our business could suffer if we fail to comply with labor laws or if one of our manufacturers fails to use acceptable labor or environmental practices."

Although we have not suffered any material restriction from doing business in desirable markets in the past, we cannot assure that significant impediments will not arise in the future as we expand product offerings and introduce additional trademarks to new markets.

Human Capital

Our purpose is to inspire the dream of a better life through authenticity and timeless style. This purpose extends to how we provide resources to support our employees' health, well-being, work-life harmony, and quality of life. We believe that attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse work force that is both skilled and motivated is critical to the successful execution of our long-term growth strategy. To this end, we are committed to creating a culture and work environment in which all employees feel welcome and can thrive, both as individuals and as part of our team. 

Our Board of Directors regularly reviews our people and development strategy, including our employee diversity, respect, and inclusion initiatives.

Our Employees

As of April 2, 2022, we had approximately 22,200 employees, comprised of approximately 13,500 full-time and 8,700 part-time employees. Approximately 10,400 of our employees are located in the U.S. and 11,800 are located in foreign countries. Approximately 5 of our U.S. production employees in the womenswear business are members of Workers United (which was previously known as UNITE HERE) under an industry association collective bargaining agreement, which our womenswear subsidiary has adopted. We consider our relations with both our union and non-union employees to be good.

As of April 2, 2022, approximately 64% and 36% of our global workforce self-identified as female and male, respectively, and in the U.S., approximately 62% of our workforce self-identified as an underrepresented race and ethnic group and 33% self-identified as white, with the remaining 5% electing not to disclose such information.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

We believe the diversity of our employees and our culture of inclusivity drive innovation and creativity, and we are committed to further strengthening such diversity and inclusion across race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, disability, and mental health and wellness, among other demographics, ensuring fairness for all. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DE&I") strategy is guided by the following five pillars:

1.Talent — Cultivate diverse teams and elevate underrepresented talent to leadership ranks. In calendar 2019, we achieved our goal to have gender parity in our leadership ranks for Vice President and above. We are committed to have at least 20% of People of Color in our global leadership team by end of Fiscal 2023.

21

2.Collaboration and Belonging — Enable open dialogue and create safe spaces for the amplification of diverse voices and perspectives. During Fiscal 2022, we expanded our RL Community Groups to include a Veterans Network, focused on supporting veterans and active military personnel, including our employees, spouses, family members, and allies, and a community group focused on religion, spirituality, and faith, focusing on the co-existence of people of different faiths in the workplace. We also continued to deepen our work in our Racial Equity Manifesto with specific and action-oriented commitments to elevate, amplify, and support the Black Community.

3.Learning — Build an inclusive culture through awareness, education, and deployment of mandatory DE&I trainings globally. During Fiscal 2022, we expanded inclusive leadership learning with the rollout of Includership training for managers of people, which is also now included in our new hire onboarding. In addition, we have mentoring and professional development programs offering internal and external development and career acceleration programs for underrepresented talent. We also provided scholarship funds to academic programs supporting underrepresented students.

4.Communication and Messaging — Maximize our inclusive message and increase the transparency of our DE&I initiatives. We gather direct feedback from our employees and measure their engagement to better understand how we can improve. 

5.Celebration and Recognition — Appreciate our unique differences and increase educational events for all employees with a focus on diverse experiences. In Fiscal 2022, we increased educational and celebratory events focused on diverse experiences with over 70 virtual and in-person DE&I events with 10,000 participants globally. Our DE&I efforts have been recognized in recent years, including being named a Best Place to Work for LGTBQIA+, receiving 100% on the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for the third year in a row, as well as being named Best Place to Advance for Women by Parity.Org.

During Fiscal 2022, our internal Global DE&I Synthesis Committee continued to meet bi-quarterly, whose members are directly accountable for executing on our DE&I strategies ensuring consistent support to achieve our goals. This committee leads all 29 of our employee resource groups and their impact work, which provides a robust structural framework to action on our DE&I commitments. We also continue to expand our advisory councils, including the Black Advisory Council (U.S.A.), Race & Ethnicity Council in Europe, Middle East, and Africa, Asian Pacific Islander Council, Native American Council, and Hispanic, Latino, and Latinx Council, who advise our executive leadership team, marketing campaigns, and long-term programs and initiatives to amplify the voices of underrepresented groups at Ralph Lauren. 

In addition to our robust DE&I governance structure, our employees play a key role in embedding a culture of inclusion at Ralph Lauren through our other employee resource groups, including our Gender Community Group, Pride Group, and Disability, Mental Health, and Wellness Group, and our new community groups focused on veterans and co-existence of people of different faiths in the workplace. These groups promote dialogue, define DE&I focus areas, and help us properly prioritize action plans and necessary resources to develop solutions. 

Additional information relating to our DE&I initiatives and goals can be found in our annual sustainability reports, which is available at our website at http://investor.ralphlauren.com under the caption "Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report." Our 2022 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report is expected to be published in June 2022. The content of our sustainability reports is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC. 

Learning and Development

We are committed to the growth and development of our employees and offer a wide range of development programs for all levels. In addition to receiving ongoing on-the-job training and coaching, our employees can build skills and prepare for the future through our Ralph Lauren Learning Portal. During Fiscal 2022 we launched our RL Success Drivers, representing key attributes, skills, ways of thinking, and behaviors that ultimately create conditions that better enable individuals and teams to succeed. Success requires all of our employees to be leaders and the RL Success Drivers act as the language of such leadership by applying a common language that defines high performance and leadership excellence. We also launched our RL Learning Academy, representing a collection of customized collaborative and experiential learning programs rooted in the RL Success Drivers that further supports our employees' career progression, reinforces our company's culture, and promotes overall wellness and balance. We continue to build our learning portfolio and have added new courses this year, many of which focus on hybrid working environments, including leading teams in such hybrid environments, as well as DE&I education. We also support learning beyond our walls through tuition assistance. These collective learning and development programs help foster career mobility for our employees, while simultaneously allowing us to fill open positions with existing employees who know our company best. 

22

Employee Safety and Well-Being

We are committed to the safety, health, and overall well-being of each of our employees and their families, providing a wide array of physical, emotional, social, and financial support to meet this objective. THRIVE, our global wellness program, provides access to volunteer events and physical and mental wellness support. During Fiscal 2022, we launched the THRIVE application to give employees real-time access to wellness articles and resiliency training and also to provide tools to set and track measurable wellness goals. We gather direct feedback from our workforce, including through regular employee surveys, which allows us to measure their engagement and understand how we can improve. 

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been to ensure the safety and well-being of all of our employees, customers, and the communities in which we operate in around the world. In this regard, we have implemented new health and safety protocols in our stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices. We have also expanded employee well-being services in the U.S. to include additional backup childcare, as well as MyStrength, an online wellness portal. Globally, we host monthly wellness webinars and provide weekly meditation classes through our RL Well-Being Exchange program. Financial grants have also been provided through the Ralph Lauren Employee Relief Fund for employees facing special circumstances.

Compensation and Benefits

We are committed to providing competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain a diverse and talented workforce. We are also committed to achieving pay equity throughout our organization, conducting annual assessments in partnership with an independent firm who is a leader in workplace equity and creators of a comprehensive analytics software platform used to analyze our employee compensation based on gender, race, and ethnicity. We offer a wide array of both employer-paid and employee-paid benefits to support our employees' overall financial, physical, and mental well-being, including, but not limited to, healthcare and welfare benefits, retirement savings, paid time off, temporary leave, sabbaticals, and flexible work arrangements. We also provide our employees a merchandise discount on most of our products. During Fiscal 2022, we further expanded our medical benefits in the U.S. to a larger portion of our part-time employees, ensuring equitable benefits for our front-line employees. We introduced a new healthcare benefit for our Puerto Rico retail employees and in our U.S. distribution center which allows them to benefit from a reduction in total cost of care. Additionally, we launched a multi-year plan to increase hourly wages for our store and distribution center employees.
