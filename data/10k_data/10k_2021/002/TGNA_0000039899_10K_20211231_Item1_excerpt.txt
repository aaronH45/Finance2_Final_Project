COVID-19 Pandemic

Since early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges including widespread economic and social change throughout the United States. At the same time, the past two years have demonstrated the strength and resiliency of our business and core strategy, and illustrated the meaningful role we play in keeping our local communities safe and informed. Throughout the pandemic TEGNA stations’ local news broadcasts have been a trusted and critical source of information for our communities. TEGNA stations reported essential information about the pandemic and its local impact, using experts to explain medical and scientific data to our audiences, in addition to providing the latest information about how to stay safe including local distribution plans for COVID-19 vaccines. TEGNA stations also were a trusted resource in helping viewers deal with the impacts of the pandemic, providing information on relief efforts and how to apply for government programs. 

The impact of COVID-19 and the extent of its adverse impact on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the degree to which the pandemic continues to affect our advertising customers. This will depend on future pandemic-related developments including the severity of COVID-19 variants, disruptions to our customers’ supply chains and impacts to their advertising and marketing purchasing patterns; the effectiveness, distribution and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines and booster shots, consumer confidence, and U.S. government actions to prevent and manage the virus spread, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.

Our Operating Structure

We have one operating and reportable segment, which generated revenues of $3.0 billion in 2021. The primary sources of our revenues are: 1) subscription revenues, reflecting fees paid by satellite, cable, OTT (companies that deliver video content to consumers over the Internet) and telecommunications providers to carry our television signals on their systems; 2) advertising & marketing services (AMS) revenues, which include local and national non-political television advertising, digital marketing services (including Premion), and advertising on stations’ websites, tablet and mobile products and OTT apps; 3) political advertising revenues, which are driven by even-year election cycles at the local and national level (e.g. 2022, 2020, etc.) and particularly in the second half of those years; and 4) other services, such as production of programming, tower rentals and distribution of our local news content.

The advertising revenues generated by a station’s local news programs make up a significant part of its total advertising revenues. Advertising pricing is influenced by demand for advertising time. This demand is influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and demographics of the local populations, the concentration of businesses, local economic conditions, and 

3

the popularity or ratings of the station’s programming. Almost all national advertising is placed through our centralized internal national sales force, while local advertising time is sold by each station’s own local sales force.

Our portfolio of “Big 4” NBC, CBS, ABC and FOX stations operate under long-term network affiliation agreements. Generally, a network provides programs to its affiliated television stations and the network sells commercial advertising for certain of the available advertising spots within the network programs, while our television stations sell the remaining available commercial advertising spots. Our television stations also produce local programming such as news, sports, weather, and entertainment.

Broadcast affiliates and their network partners continue to have the broadest appeal in terms of household viewership, viewing time and audience reach. The overall reach of events such as the Olympics and NFL football, along with our extensive local news and non-news programming, continues to surpass the reach in viewership of individual cable channels. Our ratings and reach are driven by the quality of programs we and our network partners produce and by the strong local connections we have to our communities, which gives us a unique position among the numerous program choices viewers have, regardless of platform.

As illustrated in the table below, our business continues to evolve toward growing recurring and highly profitable revenue streams, driven by the increasing concentration of our combined political and subscription revenue streams. As a result of the growing importance of even-year political advertising on our results, management increasingly looks at revenue trends over two-year periods. High-margin subscription and political revenues account for approximately half of our total two-year revenue, and are expected to continue to do so on future rolling two-year cycles.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Subscription revenue. Subscription revenue has steadily increased in the last several years, better reflecting the value of the content that our business provides. Pursuant to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules, every three years a local television station must elect to either (1) require cable and/or direct broadcast satellite operators to carry the station’s signal or (2) require such cable and satellite operators to negotiate retransmission consent agreements to secure carriage. At present, we have retransmission consent agreements with almost all cable operators, telecommunications and satellite providers in our television stations’ markets for carriage of those stations.

Our scale and strength in local content have contributed to our ability to grow our subscription revenue beyond traditional multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs) into the growing OTT (i.e., streaming) space. Distributing our content via OTT platforms allows us to reach viewers who consume content online rather than (or in addition to) via traditional television platforms, enabling us to expand our subscription revenues and deliver advertising products to a broader viewing audience.

We have OTT distribution contracts with major network partners and streaming services such as Hulu, YouTube TV and DIRECTV Stream, permitting them to carry our stations’ content. Our distribution agreements with these partners and streaming services contain financial terms similar to those in our more traditional distribution agreements with cable and satellite operators.

Affiliation agreements. We are the largest independent owner of NBC affiliated stations and third largest independent owner of CBS affiliated stations (based on TV homes reached as reported by Nielsen, September 25, 2021). During 2020, we successfully executed multi-year renewal of our affiliation agreement with NBC (extended to early 2024). In 2019, we executed multi-year renewals with CBS (extended through late 2022), ABC (extended through 2023), and Fox (extended through mid 2022).

The value we bring to advertisers. We provide our clients with data-driven integrated marketing services, using a holistic approach that puts their advertising dollars to work in the channels that make the most sense for them, regardless of the platform. We continue to expand market share in our marketing services business through our sales transformation efforts, including innovations like our centralized 360-degree marketing services agency, and a well-trained, solutions-oriented salesforce. We are also pursuing new technology initiatives that make television advertising easier to buy and are using data analytics to provide insights on consumer traffic and purchasing decisions to advertisers. 

Local News. We are recognized for our journalistic excellence, innovation in reinventing local journalism in the digital age and for reporting that addresses racial injustice and/or inequality. In 2021, seven TEGNA stations won 10 National Edward R. Murrow Awards for excellence in broadcast journalism from the Radio Television Digital News Association. More than one-third of TEGNA’s 64 television stations were among recipients of 86 Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards, the most given to any local broadcast TV group. The regional award winners included four stations that received the highest honor for overall excellence. Seven stations won for excellence in innovation for advances that enhance the audience’s news understanding, and six received the newest honor for “outstanding advocacy journalism tackling the topic of diversity, racial injustice and/or inequality.”

Innovative content offerings to our consumers. Our trusted, local content is the driver of our success across all distribution channels. Our scale has allowed us to invest in comprehensive content and digital innovation initiatives. Our focus on data-driven editorial processes, new storytelling formats, and unique visual presentations across all our platforms are helping us to advance our goal of making our content the consumers’ first choice, regardless of platform.

We produce the daily live, multi-platform syndicated news and entertainment program “Daily Blast LIVE” (or DBL) out of KUSA in Denver. Now in its fifth year, “Daily Blast LIVE” is carried in all TEGNA markets and in select non-TEGNA markets, together covering 48% of U.S. markets. “Daily Blast LIVE” is a true multi-platform play, broadcast across linear TV, digital and social media. The program broadcasts live 5 days a week, 50 weeks per year, and streams 4.5 hours of trending news each day on YouTube, Twitter, Twitch, DailyBlastLive.com, the DBL app and TEGNA’s stations apps on Roku and Fire TV. 

We own and operate entertainment brands True Crime Network, Quest and Twist, which capitalize on the rapidly growing over-the-air (OTA) and OTT television platforms. In addition to 24/7 linear broadcasts on hundreds of broadcast stations nationwide, the True Crime Network and Quest streaming apps are available on Roku, Amazon Fire TV and Apple TV, as well as via mobile and tablet on iOS and Android devices, Chromecast, and on the web. Each streaming service offers hundreds of free, ad-supported, on-demand episodes of high-quality shows and generate millions of ad impressions per month, sold in part in partnership with our Premion business. We also operate VAULT Studios, which develops high-quality podcast and original television programs developed from our stations’ vast library of true crime and investigative content. 

Engagement across all platforms. Through websites, mobile and OTT apps we extend our local brands reaching more than 90 million visitors per month. As the consumption of content on digital platforms increases, we have continued to make investments in developing new ways of connecting with local audiences and enhancing our digital capabilities. In 2021, this included initiatives focused on expanding our digital footprint across TEGNA-owned and third-party digital and OTT platforms; the continued development of new consumer products that enhance the viewer experience or generate revenue; and expanding our coverage of local sports through the acquisition of Locked On Podcast Network.

•Expanded digital footprint: In May, TEGNA expanded its fact-checking brand VERIFY to include a dedicated website at verifythis.com, social media channels and a daily email newsletter. All TEGNA station websites also now feature a prominent VERIFY section, and in 2021 TEGNA saw nearly 5 million visitors per month to VERIFY content across our owned and operated digital properties. Additionally, VERIFY-branded accounts now have more than 200,000 followers across social platforms and email.

•Developing and enhancing consumer products: In 2021, we rolled out OTT apps for Roku and Fire TV across all of our television stations, which offer streaming viewers free, ad-supported access to live news and the most recent news broadcasts, breaking news and weather forecasts, in addition to VERIFY fact-checking reports and our live entertainment program, Daily Blast LIVE. We also began distributing our streaming content through numerous third-party partners, including Amazon’s News App and Tubi. In addition to serving consumers on a fast-growing platform, we are also able to create incremental advertising inventory that can be monetized by Premion.

•Expanding our coverage of local sports: With our acquisition of Locked On Podcast Network, we feature daily podcasts for every team across the NFL, NBA, MLB and NHL, along with dozens of college teams. Locked On hosts are now routinely featured as guests in our newscasts, and more than 100 Locked On shows are now offered as video on our streaming apps and through YouTube. In 2021, Locked On had more than 115 million podcast downloads and video views, an increase of 48% vs 2020.

In late 2016, we launched Premion, the industry’s first local advertising solution for OTT streaming and connected TV (CTV) platforms. We provide local, regional and national brands with an effective, turnkey solution to run brand-safe and fraud-free streaming CTV advertising campaigns in all of 210 Designated Market Areas (DMAs) in the United States. With premium inventory from 125+ branded networks, advanced targeting, and outcomes-based measurement, Premion is a highly desirable and effective way for advertisers to reach a highly engaged streaming audience, and has enabled us to expand our revenue base and reach new markets. We have built our business on local as our competitive advantage: our large, local salesforce is leveraging relationships with local and regional advertisers to sell Premion inventory to deliver scale and measurable outcomes at the local level. In 2021, we expanded our measurement capabilities to deliver advanced vertical specific attribution for multiple industries, including verified car sales for automotive advertisers and destination intelligence for travel advertisers. Premion stayed on the forefront of innovation and won four industry awards in 2021: the Tech Leadership Award for Best OTT and Streaming Technology, and the Cynopsis Model D Awards for Best Audience-Based Buying Platform, Outstanding Brand Safety Strategy and Best Direct to Consumer Campaign. Premion continues to deliver strong revenue which was up 40% in 2021 compared to 2020. 

In 2020, we sold a minority ownership interest in Premion for $14.0 million to an affiliate of Gray Television (Gray). In connection with that transaction, Premion and Gray entered into a commercial arrangement under which Gray resells Premion services across all of Gray’s 113 television markets. Our TEGNA stations and Gray each have the right to independently sell Premion’s inventory in markets where we both operate a local television station. With this additional sales channel, our combined TEGNA, Gray and Premion direct sales force reaches OTT viewers in more than 78% of the U.S. households.

Advertising initiatives. We have further diversified our revenue base by investing in new business models that leverage our strong assets and scale.

•Intelligent Ad Automation. Premion has been our first investment in intelligent ad automation. Premion has partnered with MadHive (one of our strategic equity investments) to create a technology platform to aggregate inventory from OTT providers and then resell the inventory to local and regional advertisers leveraging our salesforce.

In addition to Premion, we are a member of the Television Interfaces Practices consortium of broadcasters driving standardization and interconnectivity of the automation of national spot advertising. Our centralized pricing resources are enabling stations to more effectively price their advertising inventory to maximize share. New attribution technologies are enabling our advertisers to better understand the impact their advertising has on consumer traffic and purchasing. The creation in 2019 of a new, integrated in-house national salesforce has evolved the way we serve our national customers and enables us to expand those relationships.

•Performance Marketing. We are a leading provider of digital marketing services for advertisers. We offer cross-platform, closed-loop measurement across linear television and OTT to enable local advertisers to better understand the value and effectiveness of their local TV and OTT ad campaigns. These capabilities help advertisers measure outcomes and understand the excellent return on investment that local linear and OTT advertising provides. 

•Dynamic Ad Insertion. During 2021, we made significant investments to build out our Dynamic Ad Insertion capabilities. Dynamic Ad Insertion enables our stations to better monetize linear television content that is distributed across various digital platforms, such as Roku, FireTV, Tubi, News On and other OTT platforms, as well as our mobile apps and websites. It provides us with data driven targeted advertising that is incremental to the traditional linear advertising. 

•NextGen TV (ATSC 3.0). In 2017, the FCC began the process of issuing rules that would permit television stations to broadcast in the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast transmissions standard, which will allow broadcasters to enhance their existing transmission services with a new standardized system that will allow us to compete directly with Internet protocols. This new standard will allow us to support higher 4K high dynamic range resolution, higher frame rate, mobile, second screen experiences, 3D audio, virtual reality, advanced advertising and other exciting enhancements to the viewing experience. The technology enables encryption and content protection that will allow broadcasters for the first time to protect their signal and to employ paywalls on certain content streams, subject to the requirement to continue broadcasting at least one stream of free over-the-air video programming. Over the past two years we have entered into channel sharing agreements with other local broadcasters in market to facilitate transition to ATSC 3.0. As of December 31, 2021, we have 17 stations that are broadcasting their primary channels in ATSC 3.0. 

Our Competition 

The proliferation of high-speed broadband to the home and phone has significantly increased competition in the video marketplace in the last decade. Today, mobile broadband covers the U.S., and a vast majority of Americans own devices that can access mobile broadband with numbers continuing to grow. Similarly, fixed, wired broadband to the home also covers a majority of the United States and is also growing.

With the rise of 5G and unlimited data plans, every screen or mobile phone is now capable of displaying video programming of the sort previously reserved to television. These video consumption patterns in the past were associated almost exclusively with younger consumers but have evolved over time to include older consumers. With the onset of ubiquitous high-speed Internet service has come an explosion of platforms and applications with video advertising capabilities that consumers have adopted. These include large players like YouTube and Facebook, and a long tail of mobile applications and services that consumers value with more being added every week. 

Our company strives to capture as large a viewing audience as possible, as the number of viewers who watch our content in each DMA has a direct impact on our ability to maximize our major revenue streams: subscription revenue, advertising marketing services revenue and political revenue. 

As noted above, we compete for audience share as part of an increasingly varied and competitive media landscape. We compete for advertising revenue with other platforms for television advertising media, including other broadcast stations and cable providers. We also compete against both traditional and new forms of media that offer paid advertising, including radio, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, online video, and social media. Major competitors in this space include cable providers Comcast and Charter, as well as internet platforms Google, Facebook, and YouTube. Advertisements on these digital platforms look like traditional television ads and compete with over-the-air broadcast ads in the local ad market. 

With respect to subscription revenue, we compete to capture a share of the total amount MVPDs are willing to pay for the rights to distribute linear TV content to their subscribers. The larger our audience share, the more appealing our programming is to the MVPDs and the more they will be willing to pay for the right to distribute it. We compete for this revenue against other broadcast stations and cable networks. In addition, we compete for audience share from broadcast stations and cable networks 

6

as well as companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices (such as Amazon Prime, Apple TV+, Disney+, HBO Max, Hulu, Netflix, and others), 

The advertising industry is dynamic and rapidly evolving. Through their websites, our stations compete in the local electronic media space, which includes the internet or internet-enabled devices, handheld wireless devices such as mobile phones and tablets, social media platforms, digital spectrum opportunities and video streaming services. In this space, we compete for audience and advertising revenue against other local media companies, Internet advertising giants such as Google and Facebook, as well as the fragmented landscape of digital ad agencies. The technology that enables consumers to receive news and information continues to evolve as does our digital strategy.

Our Regulatory Environment 

Our television and radio stations are operated under the authority of the FCC, the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act), and the rules and policies of the FCC (FCC regulations). As a result, our stations are subject to a variety of obligations, such as restrictions on the broadcast of material deemed “indecent” or “profane,” requirements to provide or pass through closed captioning for most programming, rules requiring the public disclosure of certain information about our stations’ operations, and the obligation to offer programming responsive to the needs and interests of our stations’ communities. The FCC may alter or add to these requirements, and any such changes may affect the performance of our business. Certain significant elements of the FCC’s current regulatory framework for broadcast television are described in further detail below.

Licensing. Television and radio broadcast licenses generally are granted for eight-year periods. They are renewable upon application to the FCC and usually are renewed except in rare cases in which a petition to deny, a complaint or an adverse finding as to the licensee’s qualifications results in loss of the license. We believe that our stations operate in substantial compliance with the Communications Act and FCC regulations.

Local Broadcast Ownership Restrictions. FCC regulations limit the concentration of broadcasting control and regulate network and local programming practices. The FCC is required by statute to review these rules and regulations every four years. In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order altering its regulations governing media ownership, generally making these regulations less restrictive. For example, the order eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which generally prohibited an entity from holding an ownership interest in a daily print newspaper and a full-power broadcast station within the same market, and the television/radio cross-ownership rule, which imposed a number of limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market. The order also made common ownership of two television stations in the same market permissible in more markets so long as at least one of the commonly owned stations is not among the top four rated stations in the market at the time of acquisition, and provided for case-by-case consideration of transactions that would result in new or continued common ownership of two top four rated stations in a market. The FCC’s November 2017 ownership order also eliminated a rule making certain television joint advertising sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the ownership limits. TEGNA is not currently party to any JSAs.

Various parties, including cable operators and other advocates for more stringent broadcast ownership restrictions, opposed the changes adopted in the FCC’s November 2017 order and challenged the order in court. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated and remanded the FCC’s November 2017 order effective as of November 29, 2019, thus reverting as of that date the FCC’s broadcast ownership rules to those in effect immediately prior to the November 2017 order. The U.S. Supreme Court on April 1, 2021, reversed the Third Circuit’s decision; as a result, the changes adopted in the November 2017 order were reinstated and currently are in effect. The FCC’s most recent periodic review of the local broadcast ownership rules, initiated in 2018, is ongoing. 

The FCC requires the disclosure of shared services agreements (SSAs) in stations’ online public inspection files, though these agreements generally are not deemed to be attributable ownership interests. The FCC defines SSAs broadly to include a wide range of agreements between separately owned stations, including news sharing agreements and other agreements involving “station-related services.” We are party to an SSA under which our television station in Toledo, WTOL, provides certain services (not including advertising sales) to another Toledo television station owned by a third party. We are party to several other agreements involving the limited sharing of certain equipment and resources; some of these agreements may qualify as SSAs subject to disclosure. 

National Broadcast Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act includes a national ownership cap for broadcast television stations that prohibits any one person or entity from having, in the aggregate, market reach of more than 39% of all U.S. television households. FCC regulations permit stations to discount the market reach of stations that broadcast on UHF channels by 50% (the UHF discount). In December 2017, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comments on whether it can or should modify or eliminate the national ownership cap and/or the UHF discount. Our 64 television stations reach approximately 29.9% of U.S. television households when the UHF discount is applied and approximately 39.3% without the UHF discount. 

Retransmission Consent. As permitted by the Communications Act and FCC rules, we require cable and satellite operators to negotiate retransmission consent agreements to retransmit our television stations’ signals. Under the applicable statutory provisions and FCC rules, such negotiations must be conducted in “good faith.” FCC rules also provide stations with certain 

7

protections against cable and satellite operators importing duplicating network or syndicated programming broadcast by distant stations. Pay-TV interests and other parties continue to advocate for the FCC to alter or eliminate various aspects of the rules governing retransmission consent negotiations and stations’ exclusivity rights. In addition, some pay-TV operators invested in or otherwise coordinated with an online service called Locast, which asserted that it could lawfully retransmit broadcast television signals over the Internet within the applicable stations’ Nielsen DMAs - without the originating stations’ consent - under a federal Copyright Act provision that permits nonprofit organizations to retransmit broadcast television signals under certain limited circumstances. A lawsuit filed on July 31, 2019 by the Big Four television networks, among others, alleged that Locast’s service does not qualify for the claimed exemption and therefore constitutes copyright infringement. On August 31, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, and subsequently issued a permanent injunction against Locast’s operation. Locast since has permanently shut down as part of a settlement with the plaintiffs. If in the future changes to the retransmission consent and/or exclusivity rules were adopted, and/or if services such as Locast were determined to be lawful, such developments could give cable and satellite operators leverage against broadcasters in retransmission consent negotiations, which could possibly adversely impact our revenue from retransmission and advertising.

Post-Incentive Auction Repacking. In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of a voluntary incentive auction to reallocate certain spectrum then occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, along with a related “repacking” of the television spectrum for remaining television stations. None of our stations relinquished any spectrum rights as a result of the auction. Stations in eighteen of our markets (including one station we acquired post-repack in 2020) were repacked to new channels. All of our repacked stations have completed their transitions to their new channels.

The legislation authorizing the incentive auction and repacking established a $1.75 billion fund for reimbursement of costs incurred by stations required to change channels in the repacking. Subsequent legislation enacted on March 23, 2018, appropriated an additional $1 billion for the repacking fund, of which up to $750 million may be made available to repacked full power and Class A television stations and multichannel video programming distributors. Other funds are earmarked to assist affected low power television stations, television translator stations, and FM radio stations, as well for consumer education efforts. On October 7, 2020, the FCC announced that all final invoices and supporting documentation for reimbursement requests will be due no later than (1) October 8, 2021, for full power and Class A TV stations that transitioned in Phase 5 or earlier; (2) March 22, 2022, for full power and Class A TV stations that transitioned in Phase 6 or later; and (3) September 5, 2022, for all other entities entitled to seek repacking-related reimbursements (including low power television stations and television translator stations). By law, the repacking reimbursement program will end July 3, 2023, at which point any remaining unobligated funds will be returned to the U.S. Treasury.

NextGen TV (ATSC 3.0). In November 2017, the FCC adopted an order authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard makes possible a variety of benefits for both broadcasters and viewers, including better sound and picture quality, hyper-localized programming including news and weather, enhanced emergency alerts, improved mobile reception, the use of targeted advertising, and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same 6 megahertz channel. However, ATSC 3.0 is not backwards compatible with existing television equipment. To ensure continued service to all viewers, the FCC’s order authorizing ATSC 3.0 operations requires full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard (known as ATSC 1.0) until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. The content of this simulcast signal must be substantially similar to the programming aired on the ATSC 3.0 channel for a period of at least five years. Transitioning a station to ATSC 3.0 is voluntary under current FCC rules and may require significant expenditures. As of December 31, 2021, we are broadcasting the primary channels of KGW (Portland, OR), WTSP (Tampa, FL), KUSA (Denver, CO), KING (Seattle, WA), KONG (Everett, WA), WGRZ (Buffalo, NY), KXTV (Sacramento, CA), KPNX (Mesa, AZ), WCNC (Charlotte, NC), KTHV (Little Rock, AR), WXIA (Atlanta, GA), KSDK (St. Louis, MO), WTHR (Indianapolis, IN), WTIC (Hartford, CT), WCCT (Waterbury, CT), KHOU (Houston, TX) and WUSA (Washington, DC) in both ATSC 1.0 and ATSC 3.0 formats. In each case, in accordance with FCC rules, we have entered into channel sharing agreements with other local broadcasters in the market to facilitate this transition by hosting the applicable primary channel in either ATSC 1.0 or 3.0 format. We expect to continue rolling out the new standard in coordination with other broadcasters, taking into account relevant market dynamics and our overall capital planning. To the extent we roll ATSC 3.0 service out to our stations, there can be no guarantee that such service would earn sufficient additional revenues to offset the related expenditures.

Our Environmental Regulatory Matters

We are subject to various laws and government regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health. U.S. federal environmental legislation that pertains to us include the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (also known as Superfund). We are also regulated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) concerning employee safety and health matters. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), OSHA and other federal agencies have the authority to write regulations that have an effect on our operations.

In addition to these federal regulations, various states have authority under the federal statutes mentioned above. Many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations, some of which are similar to federal requirements. State and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violating these laws and regulations. We believe that we have complied with such proceedings and orders at our stations without any materially adverse effect on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statements of Income or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

To support our DE&I goals, we are actively seeking diverse talent through recruiting, investing in a multiyear Inclusive Journalism program, requiring unconscious and implicit bias training of all employees, gathering regular input from our 17-member D&I Working Group led by Chief Diversity Officer Grady Tripp, and championing LGBTQ equality. We are proud that in 2021 the Human Rights Campaign named TEGNA a best place to work for LGBTQ equality for the fifth consecutive year. 

Here are the five pillars that support achieving our DE&I goals and notable progress we have made in 2021: 

1.Talent Pipeline and Bench Strength: Increase partnerships with diverse professional organizations, historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), Hispanic-serving institutions, and universities. Continue building on our existing internship, Producer-in-Residence, and other programs.

•Progress: In addition to our ongoing engagement and support of longstanding partners, we enhanced our relationships with such professional organizations as the T. Howard Foundation and Asian American Journalist Association. We expanded our connections with HBCUs at both the local station and the company-wide recruiting level. These relationships and a renewed focus across our company led to women and people of color comprising a majority of our participants in both our company internship program and Producer-in-Residence programs. Internally, our content leaders and talent development team enhanced our News Leadership Forum program that is tailored to emerging content leaders, of which more than half were employees of color and over two-thirds women.

2. Leadership Compensation Tied to Diversity and Inclusion Goals: Enhance our diversity and inclusion goals for key leaders in the organization.

•Progress: We delivered on our commitment to ensure that D&I goals are embedded meaningfully into both our annual performance management and our bonus processes for 2021. We also finalized our 2022 measures for key leaders. 

10

3.   Multi-Year Inclusive Journalism Program: Development and launch of customized, multi-year inclusive journalism program with expert external partners. 

•Progress: Partnering with the Poynter Institute on our Inclusive Journalism program, we delivered training on unconscious bias, inclusive reporting, and leadership coaching to all 49 of our newsrooms. This training led to development of local action plans by our stations to increase our focus on accurately reflecting the entirety of the communities we serve. We also partnered with Horowitz Research to conduct an external audit of our digital, broadcast, and marketing content across all of our stations. We are fostering new ways for our newsrooms to engage and represent communities better. These include creation of Race and Culture positions and units, community days so journalists can develop relationships with underrepresented communities, external/community DE&I committees, and an employee-initiated recruiting video centered on inclusive culture. 

4. Leverage Insights from Employee Feedback: Implement employee input to improve our action planning and accountability.

•Progress: Our company-wide D&I Working Group continues to provide valuable insights and contributions to our diversity and inclusion actions. The group’s focus has expanded to elevate issues, ideas, and opportunities across identities. Also, our local D&I teams at the station level continue to partner with local leaders to apply ideas that enhance inclusion at our stations. Input from these groups led to several actions, including development of an inclusive leadership interview matrix as well as establishment of local diverse interview panels, local mentoring networks, and inclusive hiring training for managers, among others. 

5. Employee Training: Provide employees with ongoing resources and platforms to increase learning and discussion on D&I topics to support a culture of belonging.

•Progress: In 2021, we launched a company-wide DE&I Discovery Series that covered a different DE&I learning topic each month and sparked broad participation by station groups, with discussions often led by station leaders and local D&I groups. We also launched a partnership with the National Center for Civil and Human Rights to engage in a training series on implicit bias, microaggressions, and other DE&I topics for leaders and employees that we plan to train all employees on by mid-2022. 

Serving Our People – In 2021, TEGNA was named among the Achievers 50 Most Engaged Workplaces, an annual award that recognizes top employers displaying leadership and innovation in engaging their workplaces. 

TEGNA provides a range of training and development programs that center on content leadership training, leadership development, manager training, and inside-out sales training. 

•Manager Training: We invest in the continual learning and development of our managers because our leaders’ effectiveness is critical to our long-term success. Our Manager Training Program is based on TEGNA’s critical leadership skills and provides managers a targeted and progressive curriculum. The curriculum delivers content for all levels of managers depending on their experience. This program begins by providing content on foundational policies and procedures, moves to content on how to lead effectively, and then concludes with content on how managers can foster a high-performing team. In 2021, we took the first steps by training all people leaders across the company on the critical leadership skills we’ve identified. These skills include intentional decision making; adaptive strategic thinker; change leader; talent developer; and results leader. 

•Leadership Development: We also reimagined the curriculum and set expectations for outcomes for our Leadership Development Programs, including our Executive Leadership Program that develops current and future general manager and vice president talent, and our Leadership in Action Program that helps develop current and future director-level talent.

•News Leadership Forum: Eager to build a diverse talent pool of next-generation news leaders, in January we launched a unique eight-month-long News Leadership Forum training program of high-performing news managers. Approximately 50% of the initial 33 participants had been promoted by year-end. A larger group is expected to complete the program in May 2022.

•Producer-in-Residence Program: Launched in 2018, the Producer-in-Residence (PIR) program has grown to one of the largest entry-level producer development programs in the industry. We search for PIR participants at major journalism schools as well as regional universities and colleges, including several historically Black institutions. The program includes a producer boot camp followed by two years of training at one of our local stations. The program has attained an approximately 80% promotion rate to a regular producer role after that period. 

•Inside Out Sales Training: Within our Inside Out training, besides preparing new sellers, we provide a Managers Master Class that develops leaders of our Inside Out sales process in coaching and recruiting to foster diversity of ideas and talent. We also began an online Manager Talent Assessment and Sales Assessment resource for the sales organization that in the hiring process enables managers to be more inclusive when recruiting. We also enhanced and added more on-demand and go-to-market training resources to help sellers succeed. 

In 2021, we also designed, developed, and executed two performance management training courses on giving and receiving feedback and developing S.M.A.R.T. (specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based) performance goals that were 

11

implemented during the 2021 Performance Management process at year-end. Further, we hired a learning and development business partner to help with development and application of our Manager and Leadership Development programs into 2022 and beyond. 

Championing LGBTQ Equality - For the fifth consecutive year, TEGNA was named a Best Place to Work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign’s Corporate Equality Index. The 2021 Corporate Equality Index evaluated LGBTQ-related policies and practices including non-discrimination workplace protections, domestic partner benefits, transgender-inclusive health care benefits, competency programs, and public engagement with the LGBTQ community. We received the highest marks in all categories, resulting in a perfect score of 100.

Employee Well-Being – Maintaining the health and well-being of our employees and their families is a top priority for our company. 

In 2022, several new benefits approved in 2021 take effect: 

•Family planning support: Expanded adoption reimbursement to $10,000 from $2,500 and introduced surrogacy reimbursement benefit of $10,000 to support the path to parenthood and cover family planning goals. 

•Enhanced eyewear benefit: Added EyeMed’s Freedom Pass Plus coverage that allows the purchase of frames at LensCrafters or Target Optical at no out-of-pocket cost, even if it exceeds the plan’s frame allowance (some exclusions apply). 

•Coverage for a group of jaw joint and muscle disorders: commonly referred to as Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ), these conditions cause pain and dysfunction in jaw joint and muscles that control jaw movement. These disorders are now covered by our insurance provider as a major service, providing for mouth guard coverage once every five years. 

•New critical illness and accident insurance provider that provides enhanced coverage at a lower rate than the previous provider. 

•For those treated for cancer or another diagnosis that causes hair loss, the reimbursement level for wigs increased to $1,000 from $500. 

TEGNA provides a company-matching 401(k) Savings Plan for future financial security; work/life balance benefits through TEGNA-sponsored membership to Care@Work. We also provide other additional and optional benefits including, among others, life and disability insurance plus supplemental insurance options, virtual 24/7 telehealth access, paid time off and nine company holidays, active duty leave, caregiver leave, employee discounts, a volunteerism program, two-for-one matching gifts, and student loan refinancing and tuition reimbursement. 

Employee Support During COVID-19 – Now entering the third year of the COVID-19 pandemic, employee health and safety remains a top priority for us. Our COVID-19 Task Force continues to track the case numbers in our markets, remained informed on the latest CDC guidelines, and provided practical and proactive guidance that prioritized employee health and safety while sustaining business operations. We maintained a COVID-19 handbook and employee site to share updated safety protocols including mask guidelines, building safety recommendations, mental health resources and a communications toolkit. 

Our leadership team held meetings throughout the year with colleagues from across the company to share updated health and safety guidelines, respond to questions raised by employees, and ensure stations had the resources and support to maintain business operations. All stations and facilities completed a COVID-19 safety scorecard identifying physical changes to their buildings that would help keep employees safe and healthy. They worked with their heads of technology to prepare their buildings for employees to return safely, including updated floor plans and workspaces that allow for social distancing, signage and touchless restroom fixtures. Stations and buildings also were provided with safety supplies, including KN95 and N95 masks and deep cleaning and sanitizing materials, so they could properly maintain clean and sanitized workspaces. 

In addition to their physical health, our employees’ mental health has been a top priority. Throughout the year, we hosted mental health webinars in partnership with our employee assistance program provider. They included a webinar for employees entitled “Returning to the Office to Prepare and Adapt to the New Normal,” and, for managers, “Through the Looking Glass – Thriving in the New Normal.” 

We updated our mask guidelines to reflect the CDC’s latest interim recommendations for areas with varying transmission rates. Using the CDC’s county view tool to determine their local community transmission rate, our facilities in counties identified as having substantial or high transmission could let fully vaccinated employees take their masks off while at their desks but wear their masks when walking around the building, meeting in conference rooms or having a conversation with other employees. We established that facilities within a moderate-to-low transmission rate for at least 14 business days could allow fully vaccinated employees to remove their masks while in the building. Employees not fully vaccinated continued to wear a mask at all times when in the building and to social distance. 

To create the safest workplace for all employees, we requested that employees confirm their vaccination status by the end of August if they would like to continue our health and mask guidelines for fully vaccinated employees. Finding nearly nine of 10 employees were already fully vaccinated at that time, TEGNA implemented a proof of vaccine policy for all employees that went into effect in mid-November. We also had a process to review medical and religious exemptions. As a result, 95%+ of all employees have provided proof of vaccination. 

12

Compensation and Benefits Programs – Our compensation and benefits are structured to attract the most talented people and incentivize performance based on the short and long-term strategic goals of our company. Our compensation packages include competitive base salaries, which include options for medical, dental and vision insurance, company holidays and paid time off, and parental leave. We encourage employees to invest for their future by offering a 401(k) plan that includes a company match up to four percent of salary and is fully vested from the day employees begin participating. 

Labor Union Representation - Approximately 9% of our employees are represented by labor unions. They are represented by 27 local bargaining units, most of which are affiliated with one of four international unions under collective bargaining agreements. These agreements conform generally with the pattern of labor agreements in the broadcasting industry. We do not engage in industry-wide or company-wide bargaining.

Information About our Executive Officers - Our executive officers as of March 1, 2022 are listed below, with their ages on that date, positions and offices currently held, and principal occupation and business experience during at least the last five years. All officers serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors.

Our Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability 

Our enduring purpose to serve the greater good of our communities guides us, and our values – inclusion, integrity, innovation, impact and results – propel our stations and employees to be forces for positive change in the communities where we live and work. In 2021, our purpose-driven commitments to the environment, society and governance (ESG) enabled us to make measurable progress in DE&I, to complete our first-ever greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and to invest further in our people and communities. Our ESG practices help to strengthen our business while protecting and enhancing our long-term value to our shareholders and stakeholders. Our Board’s Public Policy and Regulation Committee oversees and guides our ESG practices and initiatives, and it reviews and reports on these efforts periodically to the Board. Discussing our ESG strategy and practices openly is an important part of our commitment to continually evolve our program. 

Environmental Commitment – We are focused on being responsible stewards of our resources, recognizing the necessity for real progress on our planet’s environmental and sustainability challenges. We have enhanced our oversight, programs, reporting and accountability to further our commitment to minimize our carbon footprint and protect and preserve the environment. 

Our stations continue to bring focus on environmental and sustainability issues across the country and the globe. They regularly report on environmental climate and sustainability issues that impact their communities and, increasingly, they are generating stories about the impacts of climate change and solutions to those effects. With significant air quality issues across the United States and record drought and wildfires throughout the West, eight of TEGNA western stations launched a series of 16 stories, entitled Scorched Earth, that investigated how drought, fire and smoke create significant health issues for humans and wildlife. They also presented the impact of new methods for fighting wildfires and new ways to ensure clean air. WUSA in Washington, D.C. closely tracked a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency and showed how the agency isn’t enforcing agreed-upon standards for a multistate clean water pact to ensure the Chesapeake Bay’s health. News Center Maine did a special on climate change in the state and explored how coastal towns adapt to rising sea levels. WFAA in Dallas produced a series that coincided with November’s United Nations Summit on Climate Change in Scotland and verified or debunked each of the top 10 claims about the climate.

In 2021, we completed a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory across our scope 1 and 2 direct operations and a relevant assessment and inventory of our indirect value chain scope 3 emissions. We are conducting a qualitative assessment of our risks from the physical impacts of climate change, as well as the risks and opportunities from a transition to a low-carbon economy, per guidance of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. We believe this assessment will improve and increase our reporting of climate-related financial information.

We have begun exploring the potential for setting a science-based target initiative (SBTi) target to reduce our contribution to global GHG emission levels. SBTi targets are the gold standard for achieving climate goals for businesses and cover greenhouse gas emission reductions, water and waste management, and energy efficiency across sites, including the use of renewable electricity. 

We continued to focus on reducing business travel by using video conferencing technology across the company. We continue to apply thoughtful energy efficiency strategies, including upgrading stations’ studio lighting to LEDs; replacing in-

13

efficient HVAC systems, and replacing roofs with energy efficient materials. In addition, we will consider our suppliers’ ESG performance as a factor in procurement decisions. 

To operate in an environmentally friendly way, our environmental policies include practices for the recycling and responsible disposal of technology products and equipment such as batteries and reducing the waste we generate at corporate offices and in production processes. We regard environmental responsiveness and resource conservation as an integral part of business management, and we support finding sound solutions to such environmental problems as any arise. Each employee is expected to work toward these goals and is encouraged to advise their supervisor promptly of any situation that may be in conflict with our environmental policy.

The TEGNA Foundation supports nonprofit activities in communities where we do business and contributes to a variety of charitable causes through its Community Grant Program. Community Grants are identified locally by our stations and include support for community sustainability efforts.

Social Impact – Exposing corruption and wrongdoing, holding elected officials and those in power accountable, giving a voice to the voiceless and telling empowering stories that impact our lives is at the heart of our purpose to serve the greater good. In 2021, our stations and news teams strove to be the most trusted sources of news in our communities and to be agents of beneficial change in the markets we serve. Our local journalists are empowered to seek out the stories that matter most to their audience and pursue investigations that expose wrongdoing while continuing to maintain the highest ethical standards.

In 2021, TEGNA stations received major journalism awards that underscore our innovative approach to content, impactful investigations and commitment to the communities we serve. We received a 2021 Walter Cronkite Award for Exceptional Reporting on Systemic Racism at KPNX in Phoenix for “The Work is Hard and Not Done: Being Black in the Valley.” KING in Seattle won a coveted Peabody Award for public service for its “Facing Race” series, and it also won a duPont-Columbia University Award, as did WFAA in Dallas. We received 86 Regional Edward R. Murrow Awards, including six for Excellence in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and we were awarded 10 National Edward R. Murrow Awards, more than any other news organization, including for WWL in New Orleans’ “The Talk,” for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. The National Association of Black Journalists honored WUSA in Washington, D.C., and WVEC in Hampton, Va., with its Salute to Excellence Award, including two won by WUSA. Winning 2021 Gracie Awards from the Alliance for Women in Media Foundation were WBIR in Knoxville, WCNC in Charlotte, N.C., WKYC in Cleveland and WUSA in Washington, D.C. 

Each year, our stations identify pressing needs in their communities and partner with local nonprofit organizations to help address these issues. In 2021, our stations helped raise more than $100 million in support of diverse local causes that address specific needs in communities. For example, in Dallas, the Communities Foundation of Texas’ annual 18-hour North Texas Giving Day raised $66 million from more than 283,000 donors with the assistance of WFAA in Dallas, which built awareness through public service announcements and other promotions. 

Through the TEGNA Foundation, we work to improve lives in the communities we serve by contributing to a variety of local charitable causes via Community Grants. In 2021, the TEGNA Foundation in partnership with local stations made 330 Community Grants totaling $1.85 million. Grants are distributed within the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal framework, with the majority of 2021 grants supporting three major categories: Good Health and Well-Being, Quality Education, and Zero Hunger. Through its other programs, the TEGNA Foundation invests in the future of the media industry through Media Grants, supports employee giving and volunteerism, and contributes to a variety of charitable causes. 

Media Grants support training for the next generation of diverse journalists, education and development opportunities for journalists and other professionals in the media field, and protection of First Amendment freedoms. In 2021, we awarded $135,000 in Media Grants to 12 organizations, with the Poynter Institute for Media Studies receiving grants for two projects, including its Poynter Leadership Academy for Diversity in Digital Journalism and the Collective, a newspaper for and by people of color to provide strategies for getting the skills, connections, confidence, and voice needed to succeed in their newsrooms and produce the journalism that matters in their communities. Other Media Grants went to the American Bar Association Fund for Justice and Education to support the 2022 Moot Court competition; Asian American Journalists Association for its JCamp and Voices student programs; Carole Kneeland Project for Responsible Television Journalism to support boot camps, training, and online continuing education; and Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc. for two FOIA sessions and the Media Journalist Brown Bag lunch session at the 2021 annual conference.

Grants also went to the National Association of Black Journalists to support a professional development session at the 2021 annual conference and to co-brand the 2021 Black Male Media Project; National Association of Hispanic Journalists for its 2021 Student Project; National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association for its 2021 CONNECT: Student Journalism Training Project, a two-day virtual conference for LGBTQ student journalists; Native American Journalists Association to support its “Covering COVID-19 in Indian Country” webinar roundtable series; News Literacy Project for its Checkology Virtual Classroom Program that provides programs and resources for educators and the public; Online News Association to support student/new professional scholarships for the 2021 conference; and the Radio Television Digital News Foundation for the 2021 Student News Project. 

Our employees also give back to their local communities by volunteering for and donating to their favorite causes. In 2021, the TEGNA Foundation continued to match employee donations two-for-one to the nonprofits most meaningful to them. As a result, the Foundation approved more than 3,100 employee matching gifts, a new record. More than 1,700 nonprofits were reached through TEGNA employees’ giving. Their donations combined with TEGNA Foundation matches totaled more than $2.2 million. TEGNA supports employee participation in charitable causes, providing 10 hours of paid time off annually for volunteer work in addition to our employee matching gift program.

Our stations are also a valued resource for communities when natural disasters strike. In addition to our news coverage that keeps our audience informed and safe during disasters, our stations tell inspirational stories of heroism and hope to help our communities pull together during times of crisis. Stations also help lead in fundraising when crises hit, as several did in 2021. When weather-related calamities that included a devastating fire in Colorado and deadly tornadoes in Kentucky, TEGNA stations quickly stepped in to help provide financial aid and support. In Colorado, KUSA in Denver helped drive more than $26 million in donations to the Boulder County Wildfire Fund after wildfires destroyed over 1,000 structures and KUSA anchor Kyle Clark’s Word of Thanks campaign raised more than $1 million. In Kentucky, a 90-minute virtual telethon in which six TEGNA stations participated, generated sizable Red Cross disaster-relief funds, including a $50,000 TEGNA Foundation grant. In the aftermath of a brutal and historic February 2021 storm in Texas that overwhelmed countless residents, 12 TEGNA stations led by KHOU in Houston and WFAA in Dallas promoted the Texas Cares Winter Storm Relief campaign that raised funds for United Ways of Texas. When Hurricane Ida hit Louisiana in late August 2021, leaving bayou communities hit especially hard, WWL launched a United Way Ida Relief Fund that raised $2.5 million in cash donations and $1 million of in-kind supplies. 

For the second consecutive year, we were named to The Civic 50 by Points of Light, the world’s largest organization dedicated to volunteer service. The Civic 50 recognized TEGNA as one of the 50 most community-minded companies in the United States. We also were honored in 2021 to receive an inaugural Greater Good Award from Digiday for the COVID-19 relief efforts our stations led in their local communities. 

Corporate Governance - Our management and Board of Directors aim to create value for our shareholders through effective, ethical management of our company. Our Board of Directors has implemented strong corporate governance policies that align with best practices for publicly held companies and the evolving expectations of shareholders and institutional investors.

•Independent Board Oversight: We have an independent and diverse Board, led by an independent chairman. The Board maintains objective oversight as 11 out of TEGNA’s 12 Directors are independent, with CEO Dave Lougee serving as the only TEGNA employee on the Board. The separation of the roles of Chairman and CEO allows for effective, independent Board oversight and communication, while enabling the CEO to focus on executing the strategic plan and managing operations. The Board also conducts an annual performance evaluation to ensure the effectiveness of the Board and its committees, as well as the broader Board leadership structure.

•Active, Engaged Board: Our directors spend significant time engaged in strategy discussions in order to identify potential opportunities to create value for our shareholders. The Board also oversees risk management through regular discussions with senior leadership, considering risks in the context of our strategic plan and operations. Directors play a key role in TEGNA’s extensive shareholder engagement program, which actively seeks feedback from investors to gain a better perspective on our management and performance in key areas.

•Experience Aligned with Long-Term Strategy: Since 2017, TEGNA has undergone a Board refreshment process to ensure Directors’ expertise align with TEGNA’s strategic evolution. During this period, we added four independent Directors with deep expertise in media, technology, social/digital, and capital markets and transactional experience. 

•Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion: Our Board and management are committed to ensuring our company reflects the diversity of the communities we serve. To strengthen accountability on diversity into the governance of our company, in 2020 TEGNA’s Board adopted specific areas of oversight for each Board committee regarding how we approach diversity:

◦The Leadership Development & Compensation Committee is responsible for monitoring and supporting our performance in diversity, inclusion and equal employment opportunity, and the continuation of our efforts to gain and maintain diversity among our employees and management.

◦The Nominating & Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing the racial, ethnic and gender diversity of the Board.

◦The Public Policy and Regulatory Committee reviews with management our approach to, and initiatives and support for, promoting racial and ethnic diversity in our news and other content, through inclusive journalism and racial and ethnic diversity in our editorial decision-making and leadership.

◦The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring our finance and asset management-related diversity and inclusion efforts, including our investment and purchasing involving minority-owned businesses.

In addition to the corporate governance practices discussed above, other important corporate governance practices we follow include:

•All of our directors are elected annually; 

•Our directors and senior executives are subject to stock ownership guidelines; 

•We do not have a shareholder rights plan (poison pill) in place;

•Our Board has adopted a proxy access by-law provision; and

•Mergers and other business combinations involving the Company generally may be approved by a simple majority vote. 

Additional information regarding our corporate governance practices is included in our Principles of Corporate Governance posted on the Corporate Governance page under the “Investors” menu of our website at www.tegna.com.
