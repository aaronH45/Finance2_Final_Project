Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

COVID-19

The impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on the Company continues to evolve. Both Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have taken measures to address employee health and safety and increase employees’ ability to develop and maintain more flexible working conditions, with return to office undertaken as warranted by local conditions, and operations have remained stable throughout 2021. The Company continues to monitor its investment portfolios to adjust to market conditions, including the continuing recovery, changes in monetary policy and inflation. Both Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have accelerated investments in digital initiatives to improve productivity, efficiency and customer service over the long term. 

In 2021, sales for Aflac Japan in yen terms increased 7.7%, compared to 2020, reflecting the launch of a new medical product in January 2021 and a new nursing care product in September 2021, and favorable comparisons due to pandemic conditions in 2020. In 2021, sales for Aflac U.S. increased 16.9%, compared to 2020, reflecting increased sales activity as a result of the ongoing economic reopening in the U.S. and favorable comparisons due to pandemic conditions in 2020. 

Pandemic-related claims and associated reserve increases in both Japan and the U.S. did not materially impact financial results in 2021 and were more than offset by a reduction in claims related to non-COVID-19 medical needs. The pandemic’s impact on economic conditions contributed to sales declines in 2020 and headwinds to sales in 2021, pressuring premium growth rates, which have been partially offset by lower lapse rates in the U.S. The Company has not experienced material realized losses or impairments and credit losses associated with the pandemic. The Company continues to monitor the effects and risks of COVID-19, including its variants (both known and emerging), to assess its impact on economic conditions in Japan and the U.S. and on the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital position. Those impacts may cause changes to estimates of future earnings, capital deployment, regulatory capital position, segment dividend payout ratios and other measures the Company provides in this MD&A.

The Company’s efforts and other developments are outlined below.

•Investment Portfolio

The Company's investment portfolio was well-positioned entering the crisis, and the Company continues to follow its strategy of investing primarily in fixed maturity securities to generate a reliable stream of income. Fundamental credit analysis and actively managing the risk profile of the portfolio contributed to the current quality of the Company’s investments. Economic and market conditions have continued to improve since the onset of the pandemic. The continued path of the recovery remains uncertain given the potential longer term impacts of the pandemic. This includes structural changes in employment patterns which are impacting multiple sectors of the economy and contributing to disruptions in the global supply chain, triggering price increases across several areas of the broader economy. Supply shortages, upward pressure on wages to attract employees and higher commodity prices have all driven near-term increases in inflation. It remains unclear whether the current elevated levels of inflation are transitory or more lasting, making the ultimate impact on the global economy and markets uncertain, with resulting uncertainty as to the impact on the Company's investments.

•Aflac Japan initiatives

As of December 31, 2021, Aflac Japan had over 50% of its workforce working remotely. Aflac Japan continues to evaluate return to the office measures; however, throughout the pandemic, Aflac Japan has evaluated its operational capabilities and anticipates that the remote configuration could remain for an indefinite period of time without materially impacting operations.

Aflac Japan remains focused on generating new business from existing and prospective customers through direct mail and digital methods. Aflac Japan has also accelerated investments in digital and paperless initiatives designed to increase long term productivity, efficiency, customer service and business continuity.

•Aflac U.S. and Corporate and Other initiatives  

As of December 31, 2021, over 50% of U.S. employees were working remotely. The Company's return to worksite for U.S. based employees is expected to be a phased approach that begins in the first quarter of 2022, subject to factors including vaccination rates, the return schedule of school systems and the availability of child care, the 

33

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

number of COVID–19 cases and the COVID–19 replication rate, and the emergence of new variants and hospital capacity in areas of the U.S. where the Company has significant operations. For those employees who are working in one of the Company's worksites, safety protocols have been put in place that align with or exceed those recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). After the return to worksite, the Parent Company and Aflac U.S. expect to adopt a workforce model comprised of a mix of full time office employees, full time remote employees, and employees who will split their time between office and remote work. 

The Parent Company and Aflac U.S. also continue to maintain several actions taken for its employees. These include a commitment to cover the costs of COVID-19 testing and extended paid leave in certain circumstances. 

Aflac U.S. policy sales, enrollment and agent recruiting functions are highly dependent upon face-to-face interaction between independent agents and brokers with prospective and new customers and agents. Throughout the pandemic, opportunities for such interaction have been significantly reduced by reactions to the pandemic, such as social distancing, shelter in place orders and work from home initiatives. Notwithstanding the general improvement of economic conditions to date, the impact of pandemic conditions on Aflac U.S. sales remains subject to uncertainty as the effects of varying levels of vaccination and the emergence of COVID-19 variants continue to develop. Aflac U.S. has accelerated investments in digital initiatives designed to improve long term productivity, efficiency and customer service. Further, Aflac U.S. is in its third year of the build-out of its business in the Consumer Markets channel for the digital direct-to-consumer sale of insurance and sales made through that platform have continued to grow. 

•Major government initiatives

Government authorities in Japan and the U.S. have implemented several initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including actions designed to mitigate the adverse health effects of the virus and those designed to provide broad-based relief and economic support to all aspects of the economy. 

The FSA has requested that financial service providers in Japan respond appropriately while continuing their essential operations. This request includes insurance companies, which have been asked to continue essential operations such as benefits and claims payment, including policyholder loans. The FSA has also requested insurance companies to consider flexible interpretation and application of insurance policy provisions and measures required for products from the standpoint of protecting policyholders. In accordance with the FSA’s request, Aflac Japan implemented a measure to pay accidental death benefits and accidental serious disability benefits under its accidental death benefit rider in cases of death or specified serious disabilities from COVID-19. 

Throughout the pandemic, Aflac Japan has also followed the guidance of the FSA in terms of treating customers with care, ensuring ease and timeliness of claims payments and extended coverage for temporary medical facilities and telemedicine in certain circumstances, and waiver of interest on certain policyholder loans. In mid-2021, in response to the state of emergency declaration issued by the Government of Japan in July 2021 and August 2021, the grace period on certain premium payments was extended to January 31, 2022 and February 28, 2022, respectively.

Throughout the pandemic, Aflac U.S. has taken steps to comply with COVID-19-related directives issued by state regulatory authorities, including those requiring or requesting premium grace periods. As of December 31, 2021, premium grace periods remained in effect in two states and Puerto Rico. Aflac U.S. continues to work with policyholders in these states upon notification of COVID-19-related impacts. Aflac U.S. experienced some increase in policy lapses in 2021 in certain states where premium grace periods expired. As the few remaining premium grace periods expire, Aflac U.S. expects an increase in lapse rates, and a decrease in corresponding persistency rates.

Performance Highlights 

For the full year of 2021, total revenues were down .2% to $22.1 billion, compared with $22.1 billion for the full year of 2020. Net earnings were $4.3 billion, or $6.39 per diluted share, compared with $4.8 billion, or $6.67 per diluted share, for the full year of 2020. Net earnings in 2020 reflect a $1.4 billion benefit primarily from the release of valuation allowances on deferred foreign tax credits, which were allowed due to U.S. tax regulations released in September 2020.

34

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Results for 2021 included pretax net investment gains of $468 million, compared with net investment losses of $270 million in 2020. Net investment gains in 2021 included a decrease in credit loss allowances of $27 million; $264 million of net gains from certain derivative and foreign currency gains or losses; $164 million of net gains on equity securities; and $13 million of net gains from sales and redemptions.

Adjusted earnings(2) for the full year of 2021 were $4.0 billion, or $5.94 per diluted share, compared with $3.6 billion, or $4.96 per diluted share, in 2020. The weaker yen/dollar exchange rate impacted adjusted earnings per diluted share by $.06.

Total investments and cash at December 31, 2021 were $143.0 billion, compared with $149.8 billion at December 31, 2020. In 2021, Aflac Incorporated repurchased $2.3 billion, or 43.3 million of its common shares. At December 31, 2021, the Company had 55.8 million remaining shares authorized for repurchase. 

Shareholders’ equity was $33.3 billion, or $50.99 per share, at December 31, 2021, compared with $33.6 billion, or $48.46 per share, at December 31, 2020. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 included a net unrealized gain on investment securities and derivatives of $9.6 billion, compared with a net unrealized gain of $10.3 billion at December 31, 2020. Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 also included an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $2.0 billion, compared with an unrealized foreign currency translation loss of $1.1 billion at December 31, 2020. The annualized return on average shareholders’ equity in 2021 was 12.9%.

Shareholders’ equity excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) (adjusted book value)(2) was $25.9 billion, or $39.65 per share at December 31, 2021, compared with $24.6 billion, or $35.56 per share, at December 31, 2020. The annualized adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact(2) in 2021 was 16.1%.

INDUSTRY TRENDS 

The Company is impacted by financial markets, economic conditions, regulatory oversight and a variety of trends that affect the industries where it competes.

Financial and Economic Environment

The Company’s business and results of operations are materially affected by conditions in the global capital markets and the economy generally. Stressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets, particular markets, or financial asset classes can have an adverse effect on the Company, in part because the Company has a large investment portfolio and its insurance liabilities and derivatives are sensitive to changing market factors. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for the risk factor entitled, "Difficult conditions in global capital markets and the economy, including those caused by COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's investments, capital position, revenue, profitability, and liquidity and harm the Company's business."

Demographics

Aflac Japan Segment

With Japan’s aging population and the rise in healthcare costs, supplemental health care insurance products remain attractive. However, due to the aging population and decline in birthrate, new opportunities for customer demographics are not as readily available. Japan’s existing customers and potential customers seek products that are easily understood, cost-effective and can be accessed through technology-enabled devices.

Aflac U.S. Segment

Customer demographics continue to evolve and new opportunities present themselves in different customer segments such as the millennial and multicultural markets. Customer expectations and preferences are changing. Trends indicate existing customers and potential customers seek cost-effective solutions that are easily understood and can be accessed through technology-enabled devices. Additionally, income protection and the health needs of retiring baby boomers are continuing to shape the insurance industry.

Regulatory Environment

See Item 1. Business - Aflac Japan Government Regulation and Aflac U.S. Government Regulation for a discussion of regulatory developments that may impact the Company and the associated risks.

Competitive Environment

See Item 1. Business - Aflac Japan Competitive Markets and Aflac U.S. Competitive Markets for a discussion of the competitive environment and the basis on which the Company competes in each of its segments.

2022 OUTLOOK

The Company’s strategy to drive long-term shareholder value is to pursue growth through product development, distribution expansion and digital advancements to improve the customer experience.

The Company's objectives in 2022 are to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic while maintaining strong pre-tax margins in its Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. segments, continuing to invest in digital technology, and integrating and building upon recent acquisitions. The Company believes that its strategy of positioning itself for future growth and efficiency while defending and leveraging its market-leading position, powerful brand recognition and diverse distribution in Japan and the U.S. will provide support toward these objectives.

The Company announced a 21.2% increase in the first quarter 2022 dividend compared to the prior quarter, and it intends to maintain strong capital ratios in Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. in support of its commitment to shareholder dividends while remaining tactical in its deployment of capital in the form of share repurchases and opportunistic investments. The Company intends to maintain a minimum SMR of 500% for Aflac Japan and a target minimum RBC of approximately 400% for Aflac, consistent with the Company's risk management practices.

Aflac Japan Segment

For Aflac Japan, the Company anticipates that the shift in premiums over the last five years from first sector savings products to third sector cancer and medical products and first sector protection products, will continue to result in moderately lower benefit ratios in the Aflac Japan segment. The Company expects that benefit and expense ratios will continue to experience some level of revenue pressure due to the impact of paid up policies and reduced sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. For the 2022 through 2023 period, the Company expects a decline in Aflac Japan revenue in the range of 3.0% to 4.0% on a compound annual growth rate basis, with a benefit ratio in the range of 67.0% to 69.0% and an expense ratio in the range of 20.5% to 22.5%. The Company expects Aflac Japan to continue to operate with an expense ratio toward the upper end of the range in 2022. 

Aflac U.S. Segment

For Aflac U.S., the Company expects benefit ratios to normalize in 2022 and for expense ratios to remain elevated in light of investments into U.S. platforms, while revenues that have faced pressure due to the impact of the global pandemic are anticipated to return to growth in the near term. For the 2022 through 2023 period, the Company expects Aflac U.S. revenue growth of 1.0% to 4.0% on a compound annual growth rate basis, with a benefit ratio in the range of 48.0% to 52.0% and an expense ratio in the range of 38.0% to 41.0%.

Corporate and other

The Company expects Corporate and other results to reflect stable net investment income in 2022 compared to 2021, assuming that U.S. interest rates remain stable.

For important disclosures applicable to statements made in this 2022 Outlook, please see the Risk Factors section and the statement on Forward-Looking Information at the beginning of Item 1. Business, the Risk Factors identified in Item 1A. and Item 7. Management Discussion and Analysis.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company earns its revenues principally from insurance premiums and investments. The Company’s operating expenses primarily consist of insurance benefits provided and reserves established for anticipated future insurance benefits, general business expenses, commissions and other costs of selling and servicing its products. Profitability for the Company depends principally on its ability to price its insurance products at a level that enables the Company to earn a margin over the costs associated with providing benefits and administering those products. Profitability also depends on, among other items, actuarial and policyholder behavior experience on insurance products, and the Company's ability to attract and retain customer assets, generate and maintain favorable investment results, effectively deploy capital and utilize tax capacity, and manage expenses. 

This document includes references to the Company’s financial performance measures which are not calculated in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) (non-U.S. GAAP). The financial measures exclude items that the Company believes may obscure the underlying fundamentals and trends in insurance operations because they tend to be driven by general economic conditions and events or related to infrequent activities not directly associated with insurance operations.

Due to the size of Aflac Japan, where the functional currency is the Japanese yen, fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate can have a significant effect on reported results. In periods when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars results in fewer dollars being reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars results in more dollars being reported. Consequently, yen weakening has the effect of suppressing current period results in relation to the comparable prior period, while yen strengthening has the effect of magnifying current period results in relation to the comparable prior period. A significant portion of the Company’s business is conducted in yen and never converted into dollars but translated into dollars for U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, which results in foreign currency impact to earnings, cash flows and book value on a U.S. GAAP basis. Management evaluates the Company's financial performance both including and excluding the impact of foreign currency translation to monitor, respectively, cumulative currency impacts on book value and the currency-neutral operating performance over time. The average yen/dollar exchange rate is based on the published MUFG Bank, Ltd. telegraphic transfer middle rate (TTM).

The Company defines the non-U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this document as follows:

•Adjusted earnings are adjusted revenues less benefits and adjusted expenses. Adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are the adjusted earnings for the period divided by the weighted average outstanding shares (basic or diluted) for the period presented. The adjustments to both revenues and expenses account for certain items that cannot be predicted or that are outside management’s control. Adjusted revenues are U.S. GAAP total revenues excluding adjusted net investment gains and losses. Adjusted expenses are U.S. GAAP total acquisition and operating expenses including the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable but excluding any nonrecurring or other items not associated with the normal course of the Company’s insurance operations and that do not reflect the Company's underlying business performance. Management uses adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to evaluate the financial performance of the Company’s insurance operations on a consolidated basis and believes that a presentation of these financial measures is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of the Company’s insurance business. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per share (basic or diluted) are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively.

•Adjusted net investment gains and losses are net investment gains and losses adjusted for i) amortized hedge cost/income related to foreign currency exposure management strategies and certain derivative activity, ii) net interest cash flows from foreign currency and interest rate derivatives associated with certain investment strategies, which are both reclassified to net investment income, and iii) the impact of interest cash flows from derivatives associated with notes payable, which is reclassified to interest expense as a component of total adjusted expenses. The Company considers adjusted net investment gains and losses important as it represents the remainder amount that is considered outside management’s control, while excluding the components that are within management’s control and are accordingly reclassified to net investment income and interest expense. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted net investment gains and losses is net investment gains and losses.

•Amortized hedge costs/income represent costs/income incurred or recognized as a result of using foreign currency derivatives to hedge certain foreign exchange risks in the Company's Japan segment or in Corporate and other. These amortized hedge costs/ income are estimated at the inception of the derivatives based on the specific terms of each contract and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. The 

37

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Company believes that amortized hedge costs/income measure the periodic currency risk management costs/income related to hedging certain foreign currency exchange risks and are an important component of net investment income. There is no comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for amortized hedge costs/ income.

•Adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact are computed using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior-year period, which eliminates fluctuations driven solely by foreign currency exchange rate changes. Adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact important because a significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in Japan and foreign exchange rates are outside management’s control; therefore, the Company believes it is important to understand the impact of translating foreign currency (primarily Japanese yen) into U.S. dollars. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted earnings excluding current period foreign currency impact and adjusted earnings per diluted share excluding current period foreign currency impact are net earnings and net earnings per share, respectively. 

•Adjusted book value is the U.S. GAAP book value (representing total shareholders’ equity), less AOCI as recorded on the U.S. GAAP balance sheet. Adjusted book value per common share is adjusted book value at the period end divided by the ending outstanding common shares for the period presented. The Company considers adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share important as they exclude AOCI, which fluctuates due to market movements that are outside management’s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for adjusted book value and adjusted book value per common share are total book value and total book value per common share, respectively.

•Adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is adjusted earnings excluding the current period foreign currency impact divided by average shareholders’ equity, excluding AOCI. The Company considers adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact important as it excludes changes in foreign currency and components of AOCI, which fluctuate due to market movements that are outside management's control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for adjusted return on equity excluding foreign currency impact is ROE as determined using net earnings and average total shareholders’ equity.

•U.S. dollar-denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact represents amounts excluding foreign currency impact on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period. The Company considers U.S. dollar-denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact important as it eliminates the impact of foreign currency changes on the Aflac Japan segment results, which are outside management’s control. The most comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for U.S. dollar-denominated investment income excluding foreign currency impact is the corresponding net investment income amount from the U.S. dollar denominated investments translated to yen.

The following table is a reconciliation of items impacting adjusted earnings and adjusted earnings per diluted share to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures of net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, respectively, for the years ended December 31.

Net Investment Gains and Losses

Reconciliation of Net Investment (Gains) Losses to Adjusted Net Investment (Gains) Losses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company's investment strategy is to invest primarily in fixed maturity securities to provide a reliable stream of investment income, which is one of the drivers of the Company’s profitability. This investment strategy incorporates asset-liability matching (ALM) to align the expected cash flows of the portfolio to the needs of the Company's liability structure. The Company does not purchase securities with the intent of generating investment gains or losses. However, investment gains and losses may be realized as a result of changes in the financial markets and the creditworthiness of specific issuers, tax planning strategies, and/or general portfolio management and rebalancing. The realization of investment gains and losses is independent of the underwriting and administration of the Company's insurance products. Net investment gains and losses excluded from adjusted earnings include the following: 

•Securities Transactions 

•Credit Losses 

•Changes in the Fair Value of Equity Securities

•Certain Derivative and Foreign Currency Activities.

Securities Transactions, Credit Losses and Changes in the Fair Value of Equity Securities

Securities transactions include gains and losses from sales and redemptions of investments where the amount received is different from the amortized cost of the investment. Credit losses include losses for held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, loan receivables, loan commitments and reinsurance recoverables. Changes in the fair value of equity securities are the result of gains or losses driven by fluctuations in market prices.

39

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Certain Derivative and Foreign Currency Activities

The Company's derivative activities include:

•foreign currency forwards and options used in hedging foreign exchange risk on U.S. dollar-denominated investments in Aflac Japan's portfolio, with options used on a standalone basis and/or in a collar strategy

•foreign currency forwards and options used to economically hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in yen and hedge the Company's long term exposure to a weakening yen 

•cross-currency interest rate swaps, also referred to as foreign currency swaps, associated with certain senior notes and subordinated debentures

•foreign currency swaps that are associated with VIE bond purchase commitments, and investments in special-purpose entities, including VIEs where the Company is the primary beneficiary

•interest rate swaps used to economically hedge interest rate fluctuations in certain variable-rate investments 

•interest rate swaptions used to hedge changes in the fair value associated with interest rate fluctuations for certain U.S. dollar-denominated available-for-sale fixed-maturity securities

•bond purchase commitments at the inception of investments in consolidated VIEs.

Gains and losses are recognized as a result of valuing these derivatives, net of the effects of hedge accounting. The Company also excludes from adjusted earnings the accounting impacts of remeasurement associated with changes in the foreign currency exchange rate. 

For additional information regarding net investment gains and losses, including details of reported amounts for the periods presented, see Notes 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other and Non-recurring Items

The U.S. insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. The system can result in periodic charges to the Company as a result of insolvencies/bankruptcies that occur with other companies in the life insurance industry. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. These charges neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance, but result from external situations not controlled by the Company. The Company excludes any charges associated with U.S. guaranty fund assessments and the corresponding tax benefit or expense from adjusted earnings.

In Japan, the government also requires the insurance industry to contribute to a policyholder protection corporation that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers; however, these costs are calculated and administered differently than in the U.S. In Japan, these costs are not directly related to specific insolvencies or bankruptcies, but are rather a regular operational cost for an insurance company. Based on this structure, the Company does not remove the Japan policyholder protection expenses from adjusted earnings.

Other items excluded from adjusted earnings included integration costs related to the Company's acquisition of Zurich North America's U.S. Corporate Life and Pensions business; these costs primarily consist of expenditures for legal, accounting, consulting, integration of systems and processes and other similar services. These integration costs amounted to $26 million and $13 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company considers the costs associated with the early redemption of its debt to be unrelated to the underlying fundamentals and trends in its insurance operations. Additionally, these costs are driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of the debt, and the Company considers these interest rate changes to represent economic conditions not directly associated with its insurance operations. In May 2021, the Parent Company used a portion of the net proceeds from its April 2021 issuance of various series of senior notes to redeem $700 million of its 3.625% senior notes due June 2023. The pretax expense due to the early redemption of these notes was $48 million. In January 2020, the Parent Company used the net proceeds from senior notes issued in December 2019 to redeem $350 million of its 4.00% senior notes due February 2022. The pretax expense due to the early redemption of these notes was $15 million.

40

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Income Taxes 

The Company's combined U.S. and Japanese effective income tax rate on pretax earnings was 18.7% in 2021 and (14.9)% in 2020. In 2021, the combined effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to new tax regulations released in the third quarter of 2020 and historic and solar tax credits. In 2020, the combined effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the release of certain valuation allowances established on the Company's deferred foreign tax credit benefits. The release of these valuation allowances was a result of the issuance of Final and Proposed Regulations by the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service in September 2020, and resulted in a one-time income tax benefit of $1.4 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Total income taxes were $1.0 billion in 2021 and $(.6) billion in 2020. Japanese income taxes on Aflac Japan's results account for most of the Company's consolidated income tax expense. 

For additional information, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Estimates - Income Taxes section of this MD&A.

The Company expects that its effective tax rate for future periods will be approximately 20%. The effective tax rate continues to be subject to future tax law changes both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions. See the risk factor entitled "Tax rates applicable to the Company may change" in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for more information.

Foreign Currency Translation

Aflac Japan’s premiums and a significant portion of its investment income are received in yen, and its claims and most expenses are paid in yen. Aflac Japan purchases yen-denominated assets and U.S. dollar-denominated assets, which may be hedged to yen, to support yen-denominated policy liabilities. Yen-denominated income statement accounts are translated to U.S. dollars using the weighted average Japanese yen/U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate for the reporting period, except realized gains and losses on securities transactions which are translated at the exchange rate on the trade date of each transaction. Yen-denominated balance sheet accounts are translated to U.S. dollars using the spot Japanese yen/U.S. dollar foreign exchange rate at the end of the reporting period.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT

U.S. GAAP financial reporting requires that a company report financial and descriptive information about operating segments in its annual and interim period financial statements. Furthermore, the Company is required to report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain revenue and expense items, and segment assets. The Company's insurance business consists of two segments: Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. Aflac Japan is the principal contributor to consolidated earnings. In addition, the Parent Company, other business units that are not individually reportable, and business activities, including reinsurance retrocession activities, not included in Aflac Japan or Aflac U.S. are included in Corporate and other. See the Item 1. Business section of this Form 10-K for a summary of each segment's products and distribution channels. 

Consistent with U.S. GAAP guidance for segment reporting, pretax adjusted earnings is the Company's U.S. GAAP measure of segment performance. The Company believes that a presentation of this measure is vitally important to an understanding of the underlying profitability drivers and trends of its business. Additional performance measures used to evaluate the financial condition and performance of the Company's segments are listed below. 

•Operating Ratios

•New Annualized Premium Sales

•New Money Yield 

•Return on Average Invested Assets

•Average Weekly Producer

For additional information on the Company’s performance measures included in this MD&A, see the Glossary of Selected Terms found directly following Part IV.

Aflac Japan Pretax Adjusted Earnings

Changes in Aflac Japan's pretax adjusted earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31.

Aflac Japan Summary of Operating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Net interest cash flows from derivatives associated with certain investment strategies of $(33) and $9 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, have been reclassified from net investment gains (losses) and included in adjusted earnings as a component of net investment income.

In yen terms, Aflac Japan's net earned premiums decreased in 2021, primarily due to constrained sales during the COVID-19 pandemic and an anticipated decrease in first sector and third sector premiums as policies reached premium paid-up status. Adjusted net investment income increased in 2021 primarily due to higher alternative and floating rate income and lower hedge costs.

Annualized premiums in force at December 31, 2021, were ¥1.36 trillion, compared with ¥1.43 trillion in 2020. The decrease in annualized premiums in force in yen of 4.7% in 2021 and 4.2% in 2020 was driven primarily by limited-pay products reaching paid up status and lower sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Annualized premiums in force, translated into dollars at respective year-end exchange rates, were $11.8 billion in 2021 and $13.8 billion in 2020.

Aflac Japan's investment portfolios include U.S. dollar-denominated securities and reverse-dual currency securities (yen-denominated debt securities with dollar coupon payments). In years when the yen strengthens in relation to the dollar, translating Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investment income into yen lowers growth rates for net investment income, total adjusted revenues, and pretax adjusted earnings in yen terms. In years when the yen weakens, translating

U.S. dollar-denominated investment income into yen magnifies growth rates for net investment income, total adjusted revenues, and pretax adjusted earnings in yen terms. 

The following table illustrates the effect of translating Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investment income and related items into yen by comparing certain segment results with those that would have been reported had foreign currency exchange rates remained unchanged from the prior year. Amounts excluding foreign currency impact on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income were determined using the average foreign currency exchange rate for the comparable prior year period.

The following table presents a summary of operating ratios in yen terms for Aflac Japan for the years ended December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2021, the benefit ratio to total premiums decreased, compared to the prior year, primarily due to favorable third sector claims experience, higher surrenders in Aflac Japan's third sector business, and the continued change in mix of first and third sector business. In 2021, the adjusted expense ratio increased slightly mainly due to an increase in personnel expenses and an increase in advertising expenses related to promotion of new medical and care products. In total for 2021, the pretax adjusted profit margin increased primarily due to lower benefit ratios.

The following table details the contributions to Aflac Japan's new annualized premium sales by major insurance product for the years ended December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes term and whole life

The foundation of Aflac Japan's product portfolio has been, and continues to be, third sector products, which include cancer, medical and income support insurance products. Aflac Japan has been focusing more on promotion of cancer and medical insurance products in this low-interest-rate environment. These products are less interest-rate sensitive and more profitable compared to first sector savings products. With continued cost pressure on Japan’s health care system, the Company expects the need for third sector products will continue to rise in the future and that the medical and cancer insurance products Aflac Japan provides will continue to be an important part of its product portfolio.

Sales of protection-type first sector and third sector products on a yen basis increased 7.8% in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase reflected the introduction of new products in the first and third quarters of 2021. Nevertheless, during 2021 Aflac Japan continued to face various degrees of COVID-19 related restrictions in Japan that served to limit face-to-face sales opportunities. 

Sales of Aflac Japan cancer products in the Japan Post Group channel experienced a material decline beginning in August 2019 which continued in 2021. Japan Post Group resumed proactive sales of cancer insurance policies on April 1, 2021 and Aflac Japan continues to strengthen the strategic alliance. In April 2022, approximately 10,000 employees of Japan Post Co. are expected to be transferred to Japan Post Insurance. Japan Post Group has informed Aflac Japan that these employees' responsibilities will include sales of Japan Post Insurance products and Aflac Japan products to the exclusion of other financial products. The Company expects continued collaboration to further position both companies for long-term growth and a gradual improvement of Japan Post Group cancer insurance sales in the intermediate term. For example, during 2021 Aflac Japan has observed an increase in the number of proposals to potential customers in the Japan Post Group channel, and the Japan Post Group is expected to conduct a nationwide campaign to improve certain sales process practices. For additional information, see the risk factor entitled "Sales of the Company's products and services are dependent on its ability to attract, retain and support a network of qualified sales associates, brokers and employees in the U.S. and sales associates and other distribution partners in Japan," in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Aflac Japan continues to promote digital and web-based sales to groups and use

of its system that enables smart device-based insurance application by allowing the customer and an Aflac Japan operator

to see the same screen through their smart devices. Further, Aflac Japan continues to utilize its virtual sales tool that enables online consultations and policy applications to be completed entirely online.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

In 2021, Aflac Japan recruited 62 new sales agencies. At December 31, 2021, Aflac Japan was represented by more than 8,000 sales agencies, with approximately 112,000 licensed sales associates employed by those agencies. The number of sales agencies has declined in recent years due to Aflac Japan's focus on supporting agencies with strong management frameworks, high productivity and more producing agents.

At December 31, 2021, Aflac Japan had agreements to sell its products at 360 banks, approximately 90% of the total number of banks in Japan.

Strategic Alliance with Japan Post Holdings

As previously reported, on December 19, 2018, the Parent Company and Aflac Japan entered into a Basic Agreement with Japan Post Holdings Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (Japan Post Holdings). Pursuant to the terms of the Basic Agreement, among other items, Japan Post Holdings and Aflac Japan agreed to reconfirm existing initiatives regarding cancer insurance and to consider new joint initiatives, including leveraging digital technology in various processes and cooperation in new product development to promote customer-centric business management. In June 2021, the Parent Company, Aflac Japan and Japan Post Group agreed to pursue several specific initiatives toward building a "'Co-creation Platform' to support customers and local communities," consistent with Japan Post Group's medium-term management plan announced in May 2021. The initiatives are directed at, among other items, the promotion of Aflac Japan cancer insurance, digital transformation within the Japan Post Group, and certain diversity efforts.

On February 28, 2019, the Parent Company entered a Shareholders Agreement with Japan Post Holdings, J&A Alliance Holdings Corporation, a Delaware corporation, solely in its capacity as trustee of J&A Alliance Trust, a New York voting trust (Trust), and General Incorporated Association J&A Alliance, a Japanese general incorporated association. Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, Japan Post Holdings agreed to cause the Trust to use commercially reasonable efforts to acquire, through open market or private block purchases in the U.S., beneficial ownership of approximately 7% of the Common Stock in connection with the Basic Agreement. According to a Schedule 13G/A filed by Japan Post Holdings with the SEC on January 6, 2021, the Trust had beneficially acquired 7.45% of the outstanding Common Shares as of December 31, 2020. Japan Post Holdings is the sole beneficiary of the Trust.

On May 1, 2020, the Parent Company filed a registration statement on Form S-3 that registered the sale of its common stock from time to time by J&A Alliance Holdings Corporation in its capacity as trustee of the Trust. The filing was made strictly pursuant to a contractual requirement contained in the Shareholders Agreement. Notwithstanding the filing of the Form S-3, the Trust continues to be subject to a lockup period for a period expiring four years after the Trust acquired 7% of the Parent Company's outstanding shares. After expiration of such period, the Trust has agreed not to own more than the greater of 10% of the Parent Company’s outstanding shares or such shares representing 22.5% of the voting rights in the Parent Company.

In light of the fact that the shares acquired by the Trust, like all Aflac Incorporated common shares, will be eligible for 10-for-1 voting rights after being held for 48 consecutive months, the Shareholders Agreement further provides for voting restrictions that effectively limit the trustee’s voting rights to no more than 20% of the voting rights in the Parent Company and further restrict the trustee’s voting rights with respect to certain change in control transactions. Japan Post Holdings will not have a Board seat on the Parent Company’s Board of Directors and will not have rights to control, manage or intervene in the management of the Parent Company.

The foregoing is subject to and qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Basic Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed December 19, 2018, and the Shareholders Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit 10.50 to the Company’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed April 26, 2019, the terms of which exhibits are incorporated herein by reference.

Aflac Japan Investments

The level of investment income in yen is affected by available cash flow from operations, the timing of investing the cash flow, yields on new investments, the effect of yen/dollar exchange rates on U.S. dollar-denominated investment income, and other factors.

As part of the Company's portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac Japan invests in yen and U.S. dollar-denominated investments. Yen-denominated investments primarily consist of JGBs, public and private fixed maturity securities and public equity securities. Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated investments include fixed maturity investments and growth assets, including alternative investments in limited partnerships or similar investment vehicles. Aflac Japan has been investing in both publicly-traded and privately originated U.S. dollar-denominated investment-grade

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See the Investments section of this MD&A for further discussion of these investment programs, and see Notes 1, 3 and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding loans and loan receivables.

Funds available for investment include cash flows from operations, investment income, and funds generated from maturities, redemptions, securities lending, and other securities transactions. Securities lending is also used from time to time to accelerate the availability of funds for investment. Purchases of securities from period to period are determined based on multiple objectives including appropriate portfolio diversification, the relative value of a potential investment and availability of investment opportunities, liquidity, credit and other risk factors while adhering to the Company's investment policy guidelines.

Aflac U.S. Pretax Adjusted Earnings

Changes in Aflac U.S. pretax adjusted earnings and profit margins are primarily affected by morbidity, mortality, expenses, persistency and investment yields. The following table presents a summary of operating results for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31. 

Aflac U.S. Summary of Operating Results 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Net interest cash flows from derivatives associated with certain investment strategies of $2 and $3 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, have been reclassified from net investment gains (losses) and included in adjusted earnings as a component of net investment income.

In 2021, Aflac U.S. net earned premiums decreased, primarily due to constrained sales as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Total adjusted revenues decreased in 2021, mainly due to the decline in net earned premiums from reduced sales activity, partially offset by the increase in adjusted net investment income from higher variable net investment income. The increase in pretax adjusted earnings was primarily driven by the lower-than-expected benefit ratios due to lower incurred claims related to pandemic conditions.

Annualized premiums in force decreased 1.6% in 2021 and decreased 3.2% in 2020. Annualized premiums in force at December 31 were $6.0 billion in 2021, compared with $6.1 billion in 2020.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following table presents a summary of operating ratios for Aflac U.S. for the years ended December 31. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The benefit ratio to total premiums decreased in 2021, compared with 2020, reflecting reduced estimates of both COVID-19-related and non-COVID-19-related incurred claims since the advent of the pandemic. The adjusted expense ratio increased in 2021, compared with 2020, primarily due to planned spending on buy-to-build investments, offset slightly by lower deferred policy acquisition cost (DAC) amortization related to elevated persistency. The pretax adjusted profit margin increased in 2021 when compared with 2020, primarily due to lower benefit ratios.

Aflac U.S. Sales

The following table presents Aflac's U.S. new annualized premium sales for the years ended December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

New annualized premium sales for accident insurance, the leading Aflac U.S. product category, increased 12.7%, disability sales increased 14.2%, critical care insurance sales (including cancer insurance) increased 13.0%, and hospital indemnity insurance sales increased 6.6% in 2021, compared with 2020. The increase in sales for Aflac U.S. in 2021 is primarily attributable to increased sales activity as a result of the ongoing economic reopening in the U.S. and favorable comparisons due to pandemic conditions in 2020. Aflac U.S. expects this trend of increasing sales to continue in 2022. See the Executive Summary section entitled COVID-19 of this MD&A for additional information. 

The following table details the contributions to Aflac's U.S. new annualized premium sales by major insurance product category for the years ended December 31.

In 2021, the Aflac U.S. sales force included an average of approximately 6,000 U.S. agents, including brokers, who were actively producing business on a weekly basis. The Company believes that this average weekly producer equivalent metric allows sales management to monitor progress and needs, as well as serve as a leading indicator of future production capacity. Aflac U.S. believes that during 2021, constraints in the labor market limited its recruiting of new sales agents, and that limitations on face-to-face sales opportunities during the COVID-19 pandemic suppressed the development of newly recruited agents into business producers and the productivity of veteran agents and brokers. While 

48

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

gains were made in recruiting in 2021 compared to 2020, most notably among recruited brokers, Aflac U.S. believes that the above factors have acted as a headwind to sales and to growth in the number of average weekly producers during 2021. Aflac U.S. remains focused on mitigating and reversing these trends as the U.S. economy continues to recover from the pandemic.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Aflac U.S. remains focused on supporting its agency channel, most of which are small businesses, by offering financial support and an extended value proposition. The Aflac U.S. sales team has pivoted to accommodate preferred enrollment conditions which include realizing sales at the worksite through in-person enrollment, an enrollment call center, video enrollment through co-browsing and self-enrollment. The traditional agent sales team is also using virtual recruiting and training through video conferencing in order to maintain or increase the recruiting pipeline. The Aflac U.S. broker sales team is focused on product enhancements due to COVID-19 as well as leveraging technology based solutions to drive enrollment.

In November 2020, the Company, through its insurance subsidiaries Aflac and Aflac New York, acquired Zurich North America’s U.S. Corporate Life and Pensions business, which consists of group life, disability and absence management products. Aflac and Aflac New York agreed to reinsure on an indemnity basis Zurich North America’s U.S. in-force group life and disability policies with annualized earned premium of over $100 million. Aflac also acquired assets needed to support the group life and disability business, along with an absence management platform.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these investments.

In 2021, the decrease in total adjusted revenues was primarily driven by a decline in adjusted net investment income as a result of the change in value of federal historic rehabilitation and solar investments in partnerships discussed below, as well as lower amortized hedge income. The decrease in pretax adjusted earnings in 2021 was primarily driven by lower adjusted net investment income.

The Parent Company invests in partnerships that specialize in rehabilitating historic structures or the installation of solar equipment in order to receive federal historic rehabilitation and solar tax credits. These investments are classified as limited partnerships and included in other investments in the consolidated balance sheet. The change in value of each investment is recorded as a reduction to net investment income. Tax credits generated by these investments are recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of earnings.

In 2020, the Company purchased newly issued common stock of Trupanion, Inc., a provider of medical insurance for pets in the United States and Canada, resulting in the Company owning approximately 9% of the outstanding common stock of Trupanion, Inc. The shares were registered for resale and, pursuant to the Shareholder Agreement, subject to certain exceptions, the Company has agreed that it will not transfer its shares of Trupanion, Inc. common stock during a restricted period ending on November 13, 2023. The Company also entered into an alliance agreement with Trupanion, Inc. to sell pet insurance in worksites in the U.S., subject to certain exceptions, and to explore on an exclusive basis potential distribution opportunities for pet insurance in Japan.

INVESTMENTS

The Company’s investment strategy utilizes disciplined asset and liability management while seeking long-term risk-adjusted investment returns and the delivery of stable income within regulatory and capital objectives, and preserving shareholder value. In attempting to optimally balance these objectives, the Company seeks to maintain on behalf of Aflac Japan a diversified portfolio of yen-denominated investment assets, U.S. dollar-denominated investment portfolio hedged back to yen and a portfolio of unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated assets. As part of the Company's portfolio management and asset allocation process, Aflac U.S. invests in fixed maturity investments and growth assets, including public equity securities and alternative investments in limited partnerships. Aflac U.S. invests in both publicly traded and privately originated investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities and loans. Additionally, on November 17, 2021, the Company became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment, a global framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into investment and ownership decisions.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Generally, declines in fair values can be a result of changes in interest rates, yen/dollar exchange rate, and changes in net spreads driven by a broad market move or a change in the issuer's underlying credit quality. The Company believes these issuers have the ability to continue making timely payments of principal and interest. See the Unrealized Investment Gains and Losses section in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussions of unrealized losses related to financial institutions and other corporate investments.

Below-Investment-Grade Securities

The Company's portfolio of below-investment-grade securities includes debt securities purchased while the issuer was rated investment grade plus other loans and bonds purchased as part of an allocation to that segment of the market.

(2) Securities initially purchased as investment grade, but have subsequently been downgraded to below investment grade

The Company invests in middle market loans primarily to U.S. corporate borrowers, most of which have below-investment-grade ratings. The objectives of this program include enhancing the yield on invested assets, achieving further diversification of credit risk, and mitigating the risk of rising interest rates and hedge costs through the acquisition of floating rate assets. 

53

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company maintains an allocation to higher yielding corporate bonds within the Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. portfolios. Most of these securities were rated below-investment-grade at the time of purchase, but the Company also purchased several that were rated investment grade which, because of market pricing, offer yields commensurate with below-investment-grade risk profiles. The objective of this allocation was to enhance the Company's yield on invested assets and further diversify credit risk. All investments in this program must have a minimum rating at purchase of low BB using the Company's above described rating methodology and are managed by the Company's internal credit portfolio management team.

Fixed Maturity Securities by Sector

The Company maintains diversification in investments by sector to avoid concentrations to any one sector, thus managing exposure risk. The following table shows the distribution of fixed maturities by sector classification as of December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Principal payments in yen and interest payments in dollars

Aflac Japan has a portfolio of privately issued securities to better match liability characteristics and secure higher yields than those available on Japanese government or other public corporate bonds. Aflac Japan’s investments in yen-denominated privately issued securities consist primarily of non-Japanese issuers, are rated investment grade at purchase and have longer maturities, thereby allowing the Company to improve asset/liability matching and overall investment returns. These securities are generally either privately negotiated arrangements or issued under medium-term note programs and have standard documentation commensurate with credit ratings of the issuer, except when internal credit analysis indicates that additional protective and/or event-risk covenants were required. Many of these investments have protective covenants appropriate to the specific investment. These may include a prohibition of certain activities by the borrower, maintenance of certain financial measures, and specific conditions impacting the payment of the Company's notes.

HEDGING ACTIVITIES

The Company uses derivative contracts to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. The Company uses various strategies, including derivatives, to manage these risks. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for more information about market risk and the Company’s use of derivatives.

Derivatives are designed to reduce risk on an economic basis while minimizing the impact on financial results. The Company’s derivatives programs vary depending on the type of risk being hedged. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for:

•A description of the Company's derivatives, hedging strategies and underlying risk exposure.

•Information about the notional amount and fair market value of the Company's derivatives.

•The unrealized and realized gains and losses impact on adjusted earnings of derivatives in cash flow, fair value, net investments in foreign operations, or non-qualifying hedging relationships.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk Hedge Program

The Company has deployed the following hedging strategies to mitigate exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk:

The following table presents metrics related to Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated hedge program and the Parent Company's enterprise corporate hedging program, including associated amortized hedge costs/income, for the years ended December 31. See the Results of Operations section of this MD&A for the Company's definition of amortized hedge costs/income. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Notional is reported net of any offsetting positions within Aflac Japan or the Parent Company, respectively.

(2) Tenor based on period reporting date to settlement date

Amortized hedge costs/income can fluctuate based upon many factors, including the derivative notional amount, the length of time of the derivative contract, changes in both U.S. and Japan interest rates, and supply and demand for dollar funding. Amortized hedge costs/income have fluctuated in recent periods due to changes in the previously mentioned factors.

Aflac Japan’s U.S. Dollar-Denominated Hedge Program (U.S. Dollar Program)

Aflac Japan buys U.S. dollar-denominated investments, typically corporate bonds, and hedges them back to yen with foreign currency forwards and options to hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk. This economically creates yen assets that match yen liabilities during the life of the derivative and provides favorable capital treatment under the Japan SMR 

56

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

calculations. The currency risk being hedged is generally based on fair value of hedged investments. The following table summarizes the U.S. dollar-denominated investments held by Aflac Japan as of December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Net of allowance for credit losses

The U.S. Dollar Program includes all U.S. dollar-denominated investments in Aflac Japan other than the investments in certain consolidated VIEs where the instrument is economically converted to yen as a result of a derivative in the consolidated VIE. The Company uses one-sided foreign currency put options to mitigate the settlement risk on U.S. dollar-denominated assets related to extreme foreign currency rate changes. From time to time, Aflac Japan also maintains a collar program on a portion of its U.S. Dollar Program to mitigate against more extreme moves in foreign exchange and therefore support SMR. As of December 31, 2021, there were no collars in Aflac Japan, and none of the Company's foreign currency options hedging Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar-denominated assets were in-the-money. 

In 2021, the Company moved to a strategy that contains one-sided put options, fewer foreign currency forwards and no collars. The Company believes that the new strategy will reduce its exposure to pricing volatility and the related risk of negative settlements should there be a material weakening in the yen. Depending on further developments, including the possibility of further market volatility, there may be additional costs associated with maintaining the options program. The Company is continually evaluating other adjustments, including the possibility of changing the level of hedging employed with the U.S. dollar-denominated investments.

As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of Aflac Japan's unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated portfolio was $11.4 billion (excluding certain U.S. dollar-denominated assets shown in the table above as a result of consolidation that have been economically converted to yen using derivatives).

Foreign exchange derivatives used for hedging are periodically settled, which results in cash receipt or payment at maturity or early termination. The following table presents the settlements associated with the Company's currency derivatives used for hedging Aflac Japan’s U.S. dollar-denominated investments for the years ended December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Enterprise Corporate Hedging Program

The Company has designated certain yen-denominated liabilities and foreign currency forwards and options of the Parent Company as accounting hedges of its net investment in Aflac Japan. The Company's consolidated yen-denominated net asset position was partially hedged at $10.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, with hedging instruments comprised of $3.3 billion of yen-denominated debt and $6.9 billion of foreign currency forwards and options, compared with $9.9 billion as of December 31, 2020, with hedging instruments comprised of $2.9 billion of yen-denominated debt and $7.0 billion of foreign currency forwards and options.

57

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company makes its accounting designation of net investment hedge at the beginning of each quarter. If the total of the designated Parent Company non-derivative and derivative notional is equal to or less than the Company's net investment in Aflac Japan, the hedge is deemed to be effective, and the currency exchange effect on the yen-denominated liabilities and the change in estimated fair value of the derivatives are reported in the unrealized foreign currency component of other comprehensive income. The Company's net investment hedge was effective during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For additional information on the Company's net investment hedging strategy, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In order to economically mitigate risks associated with the enterprise-wide exposure to the yen and the level and volatility of hedge costs, the Parent Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts. By buying U.S. dollars and selling yen, the Parent Company is effectively lowering its overall economic exposure to the yen, while Aflac Japan's U.S. dollar exposure remains reduced as a result of Aflac Japan's U.S. Dollar Program that economically creates yen assets. Among other objectives, this strategy is intended to offset the enterprise-wide amortized hedge costs by generating amortized hedge income. This activity is reported in Corporate and Other. The Company continually evaluates the program’s efficacy. 

Interest Rate Risk Hedge Program

Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. use interest rate swaps from time to time to mitigate the risk of investment income volatility for certain variable-rate investments. Additionally, to manage interest rate risk associated with its U.S. dollar-denominated investments held by Aflac Japan, from time to time the Company utilizes interest rate swaptions. 

For additional discussion of the risks associated with the foreign currency exposure refer to the Currency Risk section in Item 7A., Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, and Item 1A, specifically to the Risk Factors titled “The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate“ and “Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity."

BENEFIT PLANS

Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. have various benefit plans. For additional information on the Company's Japanese and U.S. plans, see Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

POLICYHOLDER PROTECTION

Policyholder Protection Corporation

The Japanese insurance industry has a policyholder protection system that provides funds for the policyholders of insolvent insurers. Legislation enacted regarding the framework of the Life Insurance Policyholder Protection Corporation (LIPPC) included government fiscal measures supporting the LIPPC. In November 2016, Japan's Diet passed legislation that again extends the government's fiscal support of the LIPPC through March 2022. On February 1, 2022, the FSA submitted legislation to Japan's Diet that would extend the government's fiscal support of the LIPPC through March 2027, subject to final approval in the Diet. Effective April 2014, the annual LIPPC contribution amount for the total life industry was lowered from ¥40 billion to ¥33 billion. Aflac Japan recognized an expense of ¥1.8 billion and ¥1.9 billion for LIPPC assessments in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Guaranty Fund Assessments

Under U.S. state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed (up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations to the policyholders and claimants of impaired or insolvent insurance companies that write the same line or similar lines of business. The amount of the guaranty fund assessment that an insurer is assessed is based on its proportionate share of premiums in that state. See Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on guaranty fund assessments. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Liquidity refers to the ability to generate sufficient cash resources to meet the payment obligations of the Company. Capital refers to the long-term financial resources available to support the operations of the businesses, fund business growth and provide for an ability to withstand adverse circumstances. Financial leverage (leverage) refers to an investment strategy of using debt to increase the potential ROE. The Company targets and actively manages liquidity, capital and leverage in the context of a number of considerations, including:

•business investment and growth needs 

•strategic growth objectives 

•financial flexibility and obligations

•capital support for hedging activity 

•a constantly evolving business and economic environment 

•a balanced approach to capital allocation and shareholder deployment. 

The governance framework supporting liquidity, capital and leverage includes global senior management and board committees that review and approve all significant capital related decisions.

The Company's cash and cash equivalents include unrestricted cash on hand, money market instruments, and other debt instruments with a maturity of 90 days or less when purchased, all of which has minimal market, settlement or other risk exposure. The target minimum amount for the Parent Company’s cash and cash equivalents is approximately $2.0 billion to provide a capital buffer and liquidity support at the holding company. This amount excludes $400 million of proceeds from the issuance of senior sustainability notes discussed below, unallocated proceeds of which contribute to total cash but are not intended to support holding company liquidity. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company remains committed to prudent liquidity and capital management. At December 31, 2021, the Company held $5.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents for stress conditions, which includes the Parent Company's target minimum amount of $2.0 billion. 

Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. generate cash flows from their operations and provide the primary sources of liquidity to the Parent Company through management fees and dividends, with Aflac Japan being the largest contributor. The primary uses of cash by the Parent Company are shareholder dividends, the repurchase of its common stock, interest on its outstanding indebtedness and operating expenses.

The following table details Aflac Japan remittances, which are included in the totals above, for the years ended December 31.

Aflac Japan Remittances

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company intends to maintain higher than historical levels of liquidity and capital at the Parent Company for stress conditions and with the goals of addressing the Company’s hedge costs and related potential need for collateral and mitigating against long-term weakening of the Japanese yen. Further, the Company plans to continue to maintain a portfolio of unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments at Aflac Japan and to consider whether the amount of such investments should be increased or decreased relative to the Company’s view of economic equity surplus in Aflac Japan in light of potentially rising hedge costs and other factors. See the Hedging Activity subsection of this MD&A for more information. 

The Company believes that its balance of cash and cash equivalents and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy both its short-term and long-term cash requirements and plans for cash, including material cash requirements from known contractual obligations and returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. 

The following table presents the estimated payments of the Company's material cash requirements from known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021. The Company translated its yen-denominated obligations using the December 31, 2021, exchange rate. Actual future payments as reported in dollars will fluctuate with changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate.

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Liability amounts are those reported on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.

(2) The estimated payments reflect future estimated cash payments to be made to policyholders and others for future policy benefits. These projected cash outflows are based on assumptions for future policy persistency, mortality, morbidity, and other assumptions comparable with the Company's experience, consider future premium receipts on current policies in force and assume market growth and interest crediting consistent with assumptions used in amortizing deferred acquisition costs. These cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows exceeds the corresponding liability amount. Due to the significance of the assumptions used, actual cash outflow amounts and timing will differ, possibly materially, from these estimates. 

(3) The estimated payments include assumptions as to the timing of policyholders reporting claims for prior periods and the amount of those claims. Actual amounts and timing of unpaid policy claims payments may differ significantly from the estimates above.

(4) These cash outflows are undiscounted with respect to interest and, as a result, the sum of the cash outflows exceeds the corresponding liability amount. 

In addition to cash and cash equivalents, the Company also maintains credit facilities, both intercompany and with external partners, and a number of other available tools to support liquidity needs on a global basis. In September 2021, the Parent Company filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows the Company to issue an indefinite amount of debt securities, in one or more series, from time to time until September 2024. The Company believes outside sources for additional debt and equity capital, if needed, will continue to be available. Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, the Parent Company and Aflac had four lines of credit with third parties and ten intercompany lines of credit. The Company was in compliance with all of the covenants of its notes payable and lines of credit at December 31, 2021. For additional information, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

The Company's consolidated financial statements convey its financing arrangements during the periods presented. The Company has not engaged in material intra-period short-term financings during the periods presented that are not otherwise reported in its balance sheet or disclosed therein. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had no material letters of credit, standby letters of credit, guarantees or standby repurchase obligations. The Company has not entered into transactions involving the transfer of financial assets with an obligation to repurchase financial assets that have been accounted for as a sale under applicable accounting standards, including securities lending transactions. See Notes 1, 3, and 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Company's securities lending and derivative activities. With the exception of disclosed activities in those referenced footnotes and the Risk Factors entitled, "The Company is exposed to foreign currency fluctuations in the yen/dollar exchange rate" and "Lack of availability of acceptable yen-denominated investments could adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity," the Company is not aware of any trend, demand, commitment, event or uncertainty that would reasonably result in its liquidity increasing or decreasing by a material amount.

Consolidated Cash Flows

The Company consistently generates positive cash flows from operations, and has the ability to adjust cash flow management from other sources of liquidity including reinvestment cash flows and selling investments in order to meet short-term cash needs.

The Company translates cash flows for Aflac Japan's yen-denominated items into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. In years when the yen weakens, translating yen into dollars causes fewer dollars to be reported. When the yen strengthens, translating yen into dollars causes more dollars to be reported. 

61

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The following table summarizes consolidated cash flows by activity for the years ended December 31.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

The principal cash inflows for the Company's insurance activities come from insurance premiums and investment income. The principal cash outflows are the result of policy claims, operating expenses, income tax, as well as interest expense. As a result of policyholder aging, claims payments are expected to gradually increase over the life of a policy. Therefore, future policy benefit reserves are accumulated in the early years of a policy and are designed to help fund future claims payments. 

The Company expects its future cash flows from premiums and investment portfolios to be sufficient to meet its cash needs for benefits and expenses. Consolidated cash flow from operations decreased 15.2% in 2021, compared with 2020.

Investing Activities

The Company's investment objectives provide for liquidity primarily through the purchase of publicly traded investment-grade debt securities. Prudent portfolio management dictates that the Company attempts to match the duration of its assets with the duration of its liabilities. Currently, when the Company's fixed maturity securities mature, the proceeds may be reinvested at a yield below that required for the accretion of policy benefit liabilities on policies issued in earlier years. However, the long-term nature of the Company's business and its strong cash flows provide the Company with the ability to minimize the effect of mismatched durations and/or yields identified by various asset adequacy analyses. From time to time or when market opportunities arise, the Company disposes of selected fixed maturity securities that are available for sale to improve the duration matching of assets and liabilities, improve future investment yields, and/or re-balance its portfolio. As a result, dispositions before maturity can vary significantly from year to year.

As part of its overall corporate strategy, the Company has committed $400 million to Aflac Ventures, LLC (Aflac Ventures), as opportunities emerge. Aflac Ventures is a subsidiary of Aflac Global Ventures, LLC (Aflac Global Ventures) which is reported in Corporate and other. The central mission of Aflac Global Ventures is to support the organic growth and business development needs of Aflac Japan and Aflac U.S. with an emphasis on digital applications designed to improve the customer experience, gain efficiencies, and develop new markets in an effort to enhance and defend long-term shareholder value. Investments are included in equity securities or the other investments line in the consolidated balance sheets.

As part of an arrangement with Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB), Aflac U.S. obtains low-cost funding from FHLB supported by acceptable forms of collateral pledged by Aflac U.S. In 2021, Aflac U.S. borrowed and repaid $309 million under this program. As of December 31, 2021, Aflac U.S. had outstanding borrowings of $400 million reported in its balance sheet.

See Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on certain investment commitments.

Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends to shareholders and from time to time debt issuances and redemptions.

In April 2021, the Parent Company issued five series of senior notes totaling ¥82.0 billion through a public debt offering under its then existing U.S. shelf registration statement. The first series, which totaled ¥30.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of .633% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in April 2031. The second series, which totaled ¥12.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of .844% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in April 2033. The third series, which totaled ¥10.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.039% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in April 2036. The fourth series, which totaled ¥10.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of 1.264% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in April 2041. The fifth series, which totaled ¥20.0 billion, bears interest at a fixed 

62

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

rate of 1.560% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in April 2051. The notes are redeemable at the Parent Company’s option (i) at any time, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain changes affecting U.S. taxation, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the issuance or (ii) on or after the date that is six months prior to the stated maturity date of the series, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to the aggregate principal amount to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount to be redeemed to, but excluding, the date of redemption.

In May 2021, the Parent Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the April 2021 issuance of its various series of senior notes to redeem $700 million of its 3.625% senior notes due June 2023.

In March 2021, the Parent Company issued $400 million of senior sustainability notes through a U.S. public debt offering. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 1.125% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2026. The Company intends, but is not contractually committed, to allocate an amount at least equivalent to the net proceeds from this issuance exclusively to existing or future investments in, or financing of, assets, businesses or projects that meet the eligibility criteria of the Company's sustainability bond framework described in the offering documentation in connection with such notes. These notes are redeemable at the Parent Company's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such redemption date, discounted to such redemption date on a semiannual basis at the yield to maturity for a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the notes, plus 10 basis points, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such redemption date. 

In April 2020, the Parent Company issued $1.0 billion of senior notes through a U.S. public debt offering. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.60% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in April 2030. These notes are redeemable at the Parent Company's option in whole at any time or in part from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of: (i) the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the amount equal to the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments for principal of and interest on the notes to be redeemed, not including any portion of the payments of interest accrued as of such redemption date, discounted to such redemption date on a semiannual basis at the yield to maturity for a U.S. Treasury security with a maturity comparable to the remaining term of the notes, plus 45 basis points, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest on the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed to, but excluding, such redemption date. 

In March 2020, the Parent Company issued four series of senior notes totaling ¥57.0 billion through a public debt offering under its U.S. shelf registration statement. The first series, which totaled ¥12.4 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of .300% per annum, payable semi-annually and will mature in September 2025. The second series, which totaled ¥13.3 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of .550% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2030. The third series, which totaled ¥20.7 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of .750% per annum, payable semi-annually and will mature in March 2032. The fourth series, which totaled ¥10.6 billion, bears interest at a fixed rate of .830% per annum, payable semi-annually, and will mature in March 2035. These notes may only be redeemed before maturity, in whole but not in part, upon the occurrence of certain changes affecting U.S. taxation, as specified in the indenture governing the terms of the issuance.

In January 2020, the Parent Company used the net proceeds from senior notes issued in December 2019 to redeem $350 million of its 4.00% fixed-rate senior notes due February 2022.

See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the debt issuances discussed above.

Cash returned to shareholders through treasury stock purchases and dividends was $3.2 billion in 2021, compared with $2.3 billion in 2020.

Regulatory Restrictions

Aflac Japan

Aflac Japan is required to meet certain financial criteria as governed by Japanese corporate law in order to provide dividends to the Parent Company. Under these criteria, dividend capacity at the Japan subsidiary is basically defined as total equity excluding common stock, accumulated other comprehensive income amounts, capital reserves (representing statutorily required amounts in Japan) but reduced for net after-tax unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. These dividend capacity requirements are generally aligned with the SMR. Japan's FSA maintains its own solvency standard which is quantified through the SMR. Aflac Japan's SMR is sensitive to interest rate, credit spread, and foreign exchange rate changes, therefore the Company continues to evaluate alternatives for reducing this sensitivity, including the reduction of subsidiary dividends paid to the Parent Company and Parent Company capital contributions. In the event of a rapid change in market risk conditions causing SMR to decline, the Company has one senior unsecured revolving credit facility in the amount of ¥100 billion and a committed reinsurance facility in the amount of approximately ¥120 billion as a capital contingency plan. Additionally, the Company could take action to enter into derivatives on unhedged U.S. dollar-denominated investments with foreign currency options or forwards. See Notes 8 and 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

64

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

The Company has already undertaken various measures to mitigate the sensitivity of Aflac Japan's SMR. For example, the Company employs policy reserve matching (PRM) investment strategies, which is a Japan-specific accounting treatment that reduces SMR interest rate sensitivity since PRM-designated investments are carried at amortized cost consistent with corresponding liabilities. In order for a PRM-designated asset to be held at amortized cost, there are certain criteria that must be maintained. The primary criterion relates to maintaining the duration of designated assets and liabilities within a specified tolerance range. If the duration difference is not maintained within the specified range without rebalancing, then a certain portion of the assets must be re-classified as available for sale and held at fair value with any associated unrealized gain or loss recorded in surplus. To rebalance, assets may need to be sold in order to maintain the duration with the specified range, resulting in realizing a gain or loss from the sale. For U.S. GAAP, PRM investments are categorized as available for sale. The Company also uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge a portion of its U.S. dollar-denominated investments. See Notes 3, 4 and 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's investment strategies, hedging activities, and reinsurance, respectively. 

Aflac Japan's SMR ratio remains high and reflects a strong capital and surplus position. As of December 31, 2021, Aflac Japan's SMR was 1,012%, compared with 963% at December 31, 2020. The Company is committed to maintaining strong capital levels throughout the pandemic, consistent with maintaining current insurance financial strength and credit ratings. 

The FSA is considering the introduction of an economic value-based solvency regime based on the Insurance Capital Standards (ICS) for insurance companies in Japan. The FSA is currently conducting field testing with insurance companies in Japan for the purpose of investigating the impact of the introduction of regulations. Provisional specifications are expected to be decided in 2022, and a new capital regime to replace the current solvency regime may be introduced as early as 2025.

Aflac U.S.

A life insurance company’s statutory capital and surplus is determined according to rules prescribed by the NAIC, as modified by the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile. Statutory accounting rules are different from U.S. GAAP and are intended to emphasize policyholder protection and company solvency. The continued long-term growth of the Company's business may require increases in the statutory capital and surplus of its insurance operations. The Company's insurance operations may secure additional statutory capital through various sources, such as internally generated statutory earnings, reduced dividends paid to the Parent Company, capital contributions by the Parent Company from funds generated through debt or equity offerings, or reinsurance transactions. The NAIC’s RBC formula is used by insurance regulators to help identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies. The RBC formula quantifies insurance risk, business risk, asset risk and interest rate risk by weighing the types and mixtures of risks inherent in the insurer’s operations.

The combined RBC ratio for Aflac U.S. as of December 31, 2021 was 659%, compared with 550% as of December 31, 2020. The Company calculates its combined RBC ratio to include all U.S. regulated life insurance entities as if a single combined U.S. RBC entity net of intercompany items related to capital resources and risk.

The table below presents RBC ratios for the Company’s U.S. life insurance subsidiaries as of December 31, the most recently statutory fiscal year-end for the subsidiaries for which RBC was filed. The Company intends to maintain a target minimum RBC of approximately 400% for Aflac, consistent with the Company's risk management practices.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The NAIC completed its Solvency Modernization Initiative (SMI) process relating to updating the U.S. insurance solvency regulation framework. The SMI focused on key issues such as capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, reinsurance, statutory accounting and financial reporting matters. The NAIC still has some ongoing initiatives related to SMI, such as monitoring the international efforts on group capital requirements as well as RBC. In 2020, the NAIC formally adopted a group capital calculation (GCC) that conceptually uses an RBC aggregation methodology for all entities within the insurance company holding system. The GCC is intended to be a regulatory tool used by regulators as a means to standardize group capital requirements. In 2021, the NAIC concluded its analysis of bond factor changes and formally adopted the new factors as proposed by Moody’s Analytics. This initiative expanded the 

65

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

RBC bond factors from six designations to 20 designations to more closely align with rating scales used by rating agencies. The adopted changes resulted in increased capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the updated bond factors did not have a significant impact on the combined RBC ratio for Aflac U.S.

Aflac, CAIC and TOIC are domiciled in Nebraska and are subject to its regulations. The NDOI imposes certain limitations and restrictions on payments of dividends, management fees, loans and advances to the Parent Company. Under Nebraska insurance law, prior approval of the NDOI is required for dividend distributions that exceed the greater of the net income from operations, which excludes net investment gains, for the previous year determined under statutory accounting principles, or 10% of statutory capital and surplus as of the previous year-end. Dividends declared by Aflac during 2022 in excess of $1.1 billion would be considered extraordinary and require such approval. Similar laws apply in New York, the domiciliary jurisdiction of Aflac New York.

The Company’s Board of Directors has adopted an information security policy directing management to establish and operate a global information security program with the goals of monitoring existing and emerging threats and ensuring that the Company’s information assets and data, and the data of its customers, are appropriately protected from loss or theft. The Board has delegated oversight of the Company’s information security program to the Audit and Risk Committee. The Company’s senior officers, including its Global Security and Chief Information Security Officer, are responsible for the operation of the global information security program and communicates quarterly with the Audit and Risk Committee on the program, including with respect to the state of the program, compliance with applicable regulations, current and evolving threats, and recommendations for changes in the information security program. The global information security program also includes a cybersecurity incident response plan that is designed to provide a management framework across Company functions for a coordinated assessment and response to potential security incidents. This framework establishes a protocol to report certain incidents to the Global Security and Chief Information Security Officer and other senior officers, with the goal of timely assessing such incidents, determining applicable disclosure requirements and communicating with the Audit and Risk Committee. The incident response plan directs the executive officers to report certain incidents immediately and directly to the Lead Non-Management Director.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Company prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These principles are established primarily by the FASB. In this MD&A, references to U.S. GAAP issued by the FASB are derived from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification™ (ASC). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to make estimates based on currently available information when recording transactions resulting from business operations. The estimates that the Company deems to be most critical to an understanding of its results of operations and financial condition are those related to the valuation of investments and derivatives, DAC, liabilities for future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, and income taxes. The preparation and evaluation of these critical accounting estimates involve the use of various assumptions developed from management’s analyses and judgments. The application of these critical accounting estimates determines the values at which 94% of the Company's assets and 80% of its liabilities are reported as of December 31, 2021, and thus has a direct effect on net earnings and shareholders' equity. Subsequent experience or use of other assumptions could produce significantly different results.

Valuation of Investments, Including Derivatives

The Company's investments, primarily consisting of debt and equity securities, include both publicly issued and privately issued securities. For publicly issued securities, the Company determines the fair values from quoted market prices readily available from public exchange markets and price quotes and valuations from third party pricing vendors. For the majority of privately issued securities within the Company's investment portfolio, a third party pricing vendor has developed valuation models that the Company utilizes to determine fair values. Starting in June 2021, these models and associated processes and controls were transitioned to and executed by Company personnel. For the remaining privately issued securities, the Company uses non-binding price quotes from outside brokers. In September 2020, the Company refined its valuation model for private placements to explicitly incorporate currency basis swap adjustments (market observable data) to assumed interest rate curves where appropriate as noted in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company estimates the fair values of its securities on a monthly basis. The Company monitors the estimated fair values obtained from its pricing vendors and brokers for consistency from month to month, while considering current market conditions. The Company also periodically discusses with its pricing brokers and vendors the pricing techniques they use to monitor the consistency of their approach and periodically assess the appropriateness of the valuation level assigned to the values obtained from them. If a fair value appears unreasonable, the Company will re-examine the inputs and assess the reasonableness of the pricing data with the vendor. Additionally, the Company may compare the inputs to relevant market indices and other performance measurements. Based on management's analysis, the valuation is confirmed or may be revised if there is evidence of a more appropriate estimate of fair value based on available market data. The Company has performed verification of the inputs and calculations in any valuation models to confirm that the valuations represent reasonable estimates of fair value. Inputs used to value derivatives include, but are not limited to, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign currency forward and spot rates, and interest volatility.

The Company estimates an expected lifetime credit loss on investments measured at amortized cost including held-to-maturity fixed maturity securities, loan receivables and loan commitments on a quarterly basis. For the Company’s available-for-sale fixed maturity securities, the Company evaluates estimated credit losses only when the fair value of the available-for-sale fixed maturity security is below its amortized cost basis

The Company’s approach to estimating credit losses is complex and incorporates significant judgments. In addition to a security, or an asset class, or an issuer-specific credit fundamentals, it considers past events, current economic conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. The Company's estimates are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs and Policy Liabilities

Insurance premiums for most of the Company's health and life policies, including cancer, accident, hospital, critical illness, dental, vision, term life, whole life, long-term care and disability, are recognized as earned premiums over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. When earned premiums are reported, the related amounts of benefits and expenses are charged against such revenues, so that profits are recognized in proportion to earned premiums during the period the policies are expected to remain in force. This association is accomplished by means of annual additions to the liability for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs.

Premiums from the Company's products with limited-pay features, including term life, whole life, WAYS, and child endowment, are collected over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided. Premiums for these products are recognized as earned premiums over the premium-paying periods of the contracts when due from policyholders. Any gross premium in excess of the net premium is deferred and recorded in earnings, such that profits are recognized in a constant relationship with insurance in force. Benefits are recorded as an expense when they are incurred. A liability for future policy benefits is recorded when premiums are recognized using the net premium method.

Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs

The calculation of DAC and the liability for future policy benefits requires the use of estimates based on sound actuarial valuation techniques. For new policy issues, the Company reviews its actuarial assumptions and deferrable acquisition 

67

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

costs each year and revise them when necessary to more closely reflect recent experience and studies of actual acquisition costs. For policies in force, the Company evaluates DAC by major product groupings to determine that they are recoverable from future revenues, and any amounts determined not to be recoverable are charged against net earnings. See Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a detail of the DAC activity for the past two years. 

Policy Liabilities

The Company's policy liabilities, which are determined in accordance with applicable guidelines as defined under U.S. GAAP and Actuarial Standards of Practice, include two components that involve analysis and judgment: future policy benefits and unpaid policy claims, which accounted for 86% and 5% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2021, respectively. 

Future policy benefits provide for claims that will occur in the future and are generally calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be incurred less the present value of future expected net benefit premiums. The Company calculates future policy benefits based on assumptions of morbidity, mortality, persistency and interest. These assumptions are generally established and considered locked at the time a policy is issued. The assumptions used in the calculations are closely related to those used in developing the gross premiums for a policy. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Company also includes a provision for adverse deviation, which is intended to accommodate adverse fluctuations in actual experience. These assumptions may only be unlocked in certain circumstances based on the results of periodic DAC recoverability and premium deficiency testing. 

Unpaid policy claims include those claims that have been incurred and are in the process of payment as well as an estimate of those claims that have been incurred but have not yet been reported to the Company. The Company computes unpaid policy claims on a non-discounted basis using statistical analyses of historical claims payments, adjusted for current trends and changed conditions. The Company updates the assumptions underlying the estimate of unpaid policy claims regularly and incorporates its historical experience as well as other data that provides information regarding the Company's outstanding liability. 

The Company's insurance products provide fixed-benefit amounts per occurrence that are not subject to medical-cost inflation. Furthermore, the Company's business is widely dispersed in both the U.S. and Japan. This geographic dispersion and the nature of the Company's benefit structure mitigate the risk of a significant unexpected increase in claims payments due to localized epidemics and events of a catastrophic nature. Claims incurred under the Company's policies are generally reported and paid in a relatively short time frame. The unpaid claims liability is sensitive to morbidity assumptions, in particular, severity and frequency of claims. Severity is the ultimate size of a claim, and frequency is the number of claims incurred. The Company's claims experience is primarily related to the demographics of its policyholders.

As a part of its established financial reporting and accounting practices and controls, the Company performs detailed annual actuarial reviews of its policyholder liabilities (gross premium valuation analysis) and reflects the results of those reviews in its results of operations and financial condition as required by U.S. GAAP. For Aflac Japan, the Company’s annual reviews in 2021 and 2020 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in Japan. For Aflac U.S., the Company's annual reviews in 2021 and 2020 indicated no need to strengthen liabilities associated with policies in the U.S.

The table below reflects the growth of the future policy benefits liability for the years ended December 31.

Future Policy Benefits

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The growth of the future policy benefits liability in yen for Aflac Japan and in dollars for Aflac U.S. has been due to the aging of the Company's in-force block of business and the addition of new business.

The following table summarizes certain significant assumptions made in establishing reserves for the Company's products and the net impact that could result from changes in these assumptions should they occur. Under U.S. GAAP, the Company's reserves for its limited pay and long duration contracts are primarily calculated using locked-in assumptions. As such, the adverse hypothetical impacts illustrated in the table below are those that would increase the Company's best estimate reserves, but would not result in a premium deficiency requiring strengthening of reserves or write-off of DAC. The favorable hypothetical impacts in the table below would decrease the Company's best estimate reserves but they would not result in an immediate decrease to its U.S. GAAP reserves (given that the Company would be required to leave the current assumptions locked in); rather, the positive impacts would be recognized in net earnings over the life of the policies in force.

The information below is for illustrative purposes and includes the impacts of changes in a single assumption and not changes in any combination of assumptions. As a result of emerging experience, changes in current assumptions and the related impact that could result in the listed financial statement balances that are in excess of the amounts illustrated may occur in future periods.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Best estimate reserves are equal to the present value of claims, cash values, expenses, and commissions minus the present value of gross premiums, using current best estimate assumptions.

In computing the estimate of unpaid policy claims, the Company considers many factors, including the benefits and amounts available under the policy; the volume and demographics of the policies exposed to claims; and internal business practices, such as incurred date assignment and current claim administrative practices. The Company monitors these conditions closely and makes adjustments to the liability as actual experience emerges. Claim levels are generally stable from period to period; however, fluctuations in claim levels may occur. In calculating the unpaid policy claim liability, the Company does not calculate a range of estimates. The following table shows the expected sensitivity of the unpaid policy claims liability as of December 31, 2021, to changes in severity and frequency of claims.

Sensitivity of Unpaid Policy Claims Liability

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other policy liabilities, which accounted for 9% of total policy liabilities as of December 31, 2021, consisted primarily of annuity and unearned premium reserves, and discounted advance premiums on deposit from policyholders in conjunction with their purchase of certain Aflac Japan insurance products. These advanced premiums are deferred upon collection and recognized as earned premiums over the contractual premium payment period. Advanced premiums represented 15% and 19% of the December 31, 2021 and 2020 other policy liabilities balances, respectively. See the Aflac Japan segment subsection of this MD&A for further information.

Income Taxes

Income tax provisions are generally based on pretax earnings reported for financial statement purposes, which differ from those amounts used in preparing the Company's income tax returns. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and income tax basis of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the Company expects the temporary differences to reverse. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with U.S. GAAP is a two-step process. Under the first step, the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The second step is measurement, whereby a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that an amount will not be realized. The determination of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. 

In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, the Company's management considers all available evidence, including taxable income in open carry back years, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, future taxable temporary difference reversals, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event the Company determines it is not more likely than not that it will be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future, a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed. Future economic conditions and market volatility, including increases in interest rates or widening credit spreads, can adversely impact the Company’s tax planning strategies and in particular the Company’s ability to utilize tax benefits on previously recognized capital losses. The Company's judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. 

In September 2020, the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service issued Final and Proposed Regulations. Under the guidance of these regulations, the Company recognized a one-time income tax benefit of $1.4 billion due to the release of previously established valuation allowances related to deferred foreign tax credit benefits. The Company believes this will also reduce the effective tax rate in future periods, subject to any future changes in the U.S. tax policy.

An increase or decrease in the Company's effective tax rate by one percentage point would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the Company's 2021 income tax expense of $49 million.

For additional information on income tax, see Note 10 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in this report.

Future Adoption of Accounting Standard for Long-Duration Insurance Contracts

In August 2018, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12, “Financial Services - Insurance, Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (The ASU). The update significantly changes how insurers account for long-duration contracts, amends existing recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure requirements applicable to the Company. Issues addressed in the new guidance include: 1) a requirement to review and, if there is a change, update cash flow assumptions for the liability for future policy benefits at least annually, and to update the discount rate assumption quarterly, 2) accounting for market risk benefits at fair value, 3) simplified amortization for deferred acquisition costs, and 4) enhanced financial statement presentation and disclosures. The Company has no products with market risk benefits.

Since the initial issuance, the FASB has deferred the ASU effective date for two years, such that the amendments are now effective for the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2022. Early application of the amendments is permitted, however, the Company will not early adopt the updated standard. The Company plans to use the additional time to educate investors and analysts on the adoption impact, conduct robust testing and analysis, enhance the control environment, and perform parallel financial reporting. 

The Company continues to evaluate the impact of adoption and expects that the adoption will have a significant impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, and disclosures. The Company anticipates that the requirement to update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits (LFPB) will have a significant impact on its results of operations, systems, processes and controls and that the requirement to update discount rates will have a significant impact on its AOCI and equity. 

The ultimate impact on these items from the Company’s implementation of the updated standard is subject to assessments that are dependent on many variables, including but not limited to (i) how certain aspects of the new standard will be interpreted and implemented by the Company and other similar companies, such as (but not limited to) amortization of deferred acquisition costs and selection of discounting methodologies and inputs, as well as establishment of policies, processes and controls for setting, monitoring and periodically updating reserve assumptions, and (ii) changes in the interest rate environment in the U.S. and Japan. 

There are two permitted transition methods upon adoption and the Company has selected the modified retrospective transition method. The new guidance requires that discount rates used for the discounting of insurance liabilities be initially adjusted on the adoption date and subsequently at each reporting period to the market levels for the upper-medium-grade (low credit risk) fixed income instrument yields (single-A in the currency of the underlying insurance contract) reflecting the duration of the Company’s insurance liabilities.

The primary impact on transition under the modified retrospective method is driven by updating discount rates that increase reserves and lower AOCI by the corresponding amount, net of tax. The Company currently estimates that the January 1, 2021 transition date (Transition Date) impact from adoption is likely to result in a decrease in AOCI in a range between $18 billion and $20 billion. The preliminary impact results from updating discount rate assumptions from the rates locked in for reserves held as of the Transition Date to rates determined by reference to the Transition Date market level yields for upper-medium-grade (low credit risk) fixed income instruments (as of December 31, 2020). The variability around the impact of adoption results from the Company making certain estimates, primarily related to the determination of Transition Date market level yields. Based on the Company’s current discount rate methodology developed under the new ASU, if interest rates increased or decreased by 25 basis points as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s AOCI as of that date would increase or decrease by $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively.

As discussed in detail in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company has advanced and continues to refine the design of its discount rate methodology for both the U.S. and Japan insurance business. Upon adoption of the new ASU, discount rates will be updated each reporting period.

The impact to the Company’s reported financial statements under U.S. GAAP is greatly influenced by the nature of the Company’s business model. Adoption of the new guidance reflects the Company’s concentration in Japan third-sector business, in particular cancer insurance, with respect to which the duration of liabilities is materially longer than asset durations, while Japan’s aggregate block of business continues to see favorable experience from mortality, morbidity, and expenses. The long duration of the Company’s third-sector insurance liabilities in Japan coupled with limited-to-no-liquidity of the Japanese long-dated fixed-income market creates challenges in application of the market-based discount rate guidance and will require the Company to apply significant judgments in designing discount rate methodologies for its Japanese third-sector liabilities. Under the modified retrospective method, the impact of a low discount rate applied to long-duration third sector liabilities is recognized at adoption, while associated favorable morbidity margins are recognized 

71

Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

over time thus driving a pronounced timing impact to U.S. GAAP equity. In addition, with respect to the Japan segment, the Company maintains a large portfolio of assets designated as held-to-maturity (HTM) as a strategy to reduce capital (solvency margin ratio or SMR) volatility. In a low interest rate environment, such as presently exists in Japan, assets designated as HTM that were purchased in a higher interest rate environment have significant embedded gains not reflected in AOCI (HTM securities are carried at amortized cost under U.S. GAAP), which serves as an economic offset to a low discount rate applied to policy liabilities. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s HTM portfolio was $22.0 billion at amortized cost and had $4.9 billion in net unrealized gains. After adoption of ASU 2018-12, the Company also expects net earnings and net earnings per share (which were $4.3 billion and $6.39 per diluted share, respectively, in 2021) to reflect larger quarterly fluctuations due to the new requirement to update assumptions for liability for future policy benefits.

In the near term, the expected impact on the Company’s key financial ratios is limited. Generally, benefit ratios are expected to be slightly higher as favorable experience is absorbed into reserves, while expense ratios are expected to be modestly lower due to amortizing deferred acquisition costs at a slower rate. This results in a slightly higher profit margin in Japan and an insignificant impact to the U.S. profit margin.

The Company has created a robust governance framework and a plan to support implementation of the updated standard. As part of its implementation plan, the Company has made preliminary policy elections on key accounting policy decisions (discount rate, cash flow assumptions, and deferred acquisition costs amortization). See Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on preliminary policy elections. The Company has also advanced the modernization of its actuarial technology platform to enhance its modeling, data management, experience study and analytical capabilities, increase the end-to-end automation of key reporting and analytical processes and optimize its control framework. The Company has also put in place internal controls related to the new processes created as part of implementing the updated standard and will continue to refine and maturate these internal controls until the formal implementation in the first quarter of 2023.

The Company expects that while the adoption of this new accounting guidance will affect the Company’s financial statements under U.S. GAAP, it will not impact financial statements for Aflac Japan under FSA requirements or for Aflac U.S. under applicable statutory requirements. Therefore, the Company does not expect adoption of the updated standard to impact its overall cash flows, subsidiaries’ dividend capacity or their ability to meet applicable regulatory capital standards, nor does the Company anticipate adoption to affect its existing debt covenants or strategies for capital deployment. 

New Accounting Pronouncements

During the last three years, various accounting standard-setting bodies have been active in soliciting comments and issuing statements, interpretations and exposure drafts. For information on new accounting pronouncements and the impact, if any, on the Company's financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
