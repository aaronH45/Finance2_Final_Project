ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

All statements in this section, other than statements of historical fact, are forward-looking statements that are inherently uncertain. See “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in these statements. The following information concerning our business, results of operations and financial condition should also be read in conjunction with the information included under Item 1. Business, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Business Update

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we continued to see recovery in the environment in which our business operates, albeit in some markets and regions more or less than others. The increased availability of vaccinations and the reductions in travel and business restrictions appeared to drive increased economic activity, including the opening of many businesses and schools, as well as more in-person interaction broadly. Demand for gasoline and distillates, excluding jet fuel, have returned to near 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Permanent remote work and teleconferencing arrangements may continue to impact demand for our refined products. While we have seen improved results through 2021, we are unable to predict the potential effects that further resurgences of COVID-19 may have on our financial position and results. 

In response to this business environment, we continue to focus on the following priorities for our business:

Strengthen Competitive Position of Assets

We are committed to positioning our assets so that we are a leader in operational, financial, and sustainability performance and are evaluating the strength and fit of assets in our portfolio. Our goal is that each individual asset generates free-cash-flow back to the business and contributes to shareholder returns. With our investments we are focused on high returning projects that we believe will enhance the competitiveness of our portfolio, including our investments in sustainable fuels and technologies that lower our carbon intensity as the global energy mix evolves.

Improve Commercial Performance

We are focused on leveraging advantaged raw material selection, new approaches in the commercial space to be more dynamic amidst changing market conditions, and achieving technology improvements to advance our commercial performance. A near-term focus has been securing advantaged renewable feedstocks as we continue to advance our renewable fuels production capabilities. This includes exploring joint venture opportunities and strategic alliances within the renewable fuels value chain.

Continued Capital Discipline and Focus on Low-Cost Culture

We are committed to achieving operational excellence by reducing costs, improving efficiency, driving operational improvements and being disciplined in capital allocation. This means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be disciplined in every dollar we spend across our organization. We look to optimize our portfolio of investment opportunities to ensure efficient deployment of capital focusing on projects with the highest returns.

In connection with our commitment to lower cost and strengthen the competitive position of our assets, in the third quarter of 2020, we announced strategic actions to lay a foundation for long-term success, including plans to optimize our assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond. These actions included indefinitely idling the Gallup refinery, initiating actions to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and the approval of an involuntary workforce reduction plan. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflect the favorable effects from these cost reduction actions.

Many uncertainties remain with respect to COVID-19, and we are unable to predict the ultimate economic impacts from COVID-19 and how quickly the U.S. and economies around the world can recover once the pandemic ultimately subsides. However, the adverse impact of the economic effects on MPC have been and may continue to be significant. 

Commitment to Sustainability

Our approach to sustainability spans the environmental, social and governance dimensions of our business. That means strengthening resiliency by lowering the carbon intensity and conserving natural resources; innovating for the future by investing in renewables and emerging technologies; and embedding sustainability in decision-making and in how we engage our people and many stakeholders. Specifically, we established a 2030 target to reduce our absolute Scope 3 - Category 11 GHG emissions by 15% below 2019 levels. Additionally, MPLX established a new 2030 target to reduce methane emissions intensity by 75% below 2016 levels. The reduction target applies to MPLX’s natural gas gathering and processing operations and represents an expansion of the existing 2025 target, established in 2020, to reduce methane emissions intensity by 50% below 2016 levels.

Strategic Updates

On February 2, 2022, we announced our board of directors approved an incremental $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, MPC had $5.27 billion remaining under its share repurchase authorizations prior to this additional authorization.

On December 14, 2021, we finalized the formation of a joint venture with Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (“ADM”) for the production of soybean oil to supply rapidly growing demand for renewable diesel fuel. The joint venture, which is named Green Bison Soy Processing, LLC, will own and operate a soybean processing complex in Spiritwood, North Dakota, with ADM owning 75 percent of the joint venture and MPC owning 25 percent. When complete in 2023, the Spiritwood facility will source and process local soybeans and supply the resulting soybean oil exclusively to MPC. The Spiritwood complex is expected to produce approximately 600 million pounds of refined soybean oil annually, enough feedstock for approximately 75 million gallons of renewable diesel per year. 

On May 14, 2021, we completed the sale of Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven for cash proceeds of $21.38 billion. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $11.68 billion ($8.02 billion after income taxes) after deducting the book value of the net assets and certain other adjustments. MPC remains committed to executing its plan to use the net proceeds from the sale to strengthen the balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.

In connection with the Speedway sale, our board of directors approved an additional $7.1 billion share repurchase authorization bringing total share repurchase authorizations to $10.0 billion prior to the June tender offer discussed below.

•During 2021, including the modified Dutch auction tender offer discussed below, MPC repurchased approximately 76 million shares of its common stock and paid approximately $4.65 billion of cash, with an additional $85 million of cash paid in the first quarter of 2022 in connection with the settlement of certain late December repurchases. 

•During the second quarter of 2021, MPC completed a modified Dutch auction tender offer, purchasing 15,573,365 shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $63.00 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $981 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. 

During 2021, we reduced debt through the following actions:

•On December 2, 2021, all of the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC's 4.5% senior notes due May 2023 and the $850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 4.75% senior notes due December 2023, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor LLC was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par, plus a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. MPC funded the redemption amount with cash on hand.

•In June 2021,we redeemed all of the $300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due April 2024 at a price equal to 100.854% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.

•In May 2021, we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which, along with cash, had been used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of MPC’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of $1.13 billion.

•On March 1, 2021, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due March 2021. 

On February 24, 2021, we announced our plan to strategically reposition the Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility. Converting the Martinez facility from refining petroleum to manufacturing renewable fuels signals our strong commitment to producing a substantial level of lower carbon-intensity fuels in California. As envisioned, the Martinez facility would start producing approximately 260 million gallons per year of renewable diesel by the second half of 2022, with pretreatment capabilities coming online in 2023. The facility is expected to be capable of producing approximately 730 million gallons per year by the end of 2023. 

The Dickinson, North Dakota, renewable fuels facility began operations at the end of 2020 and reached full design operating capacity in the second quarter of 2021. The facility has the capacity to produce 184 million gallons per year of renewable diesel from corn oil, soybean oil, fats, and greases. The produced renewable diesel generates federal RINs and LCFS credits when sold in California or similar markets. These instruments are used to help meet our Renewable Fuel Standard and LCFS compliance obligations as a petroleum fuel producer.

Effective Tax Rate

Our effective income tax rate is affected by the weighting of income from our wholly owned operations versus net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. Additionally, tax rate differences can arise from non-forecasted discrete items. During operating environments when refining margins approximate historical averages, we generally expect our effective tax rate to be between 18 percent and 21 percent, excluding discrete tax items. A reconciliation of the statutory tax rate of 21 percent to our 

42
effective tax rate of 9 percent for the period ended December 31, 2021 is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note14.

Results

Select results for continuing operations for 2021 and 2020 are reflected in the following table. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million for 2020.

(b)2021 includes impairment expenses related to long-lived assets and equity method investments. 2020 includes impairments of goodwill, equity method investments and long-lived assets. 

(c)2020 restructuring expenses include $195 million for exit costs related to the Martinez and Gallup refineries and $172 million of employee separation costs.

(d)2020 includes costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review. 

Select results for discontinued operations are reflected in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Costs related to the Speedway separation.

The following table includes net income (loss) per diluted share data.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net income attributable to MPC increased $19.56 billion, or $30.37 per diluted share, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sale of Speedway, the absence of impairment expenses and a LIFO liquidation charge and increases in average refined product sales prices and volumes, partially offset by a partial period of income from discontinued operations due to the sale of the Speedway business on May 14, 2021.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 for additional information on discontinued operations.

43
Refer to the Results of Operations section for a discussion of financial results by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2021.

MPLX

We received limited partner distributions of $2.16 billion and $1.79 billion from MPLX during 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to a special distribution amount of $0.5750 per common unit in the third quarter of 2021. We owned approximately 647 million MPLX common units at December 31, 2021 with a market value of $19.16 billion based on the December 31, 2021 closing unit price of $29.59. On January 25, 2022, MPLX declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.7050 per common unit, which was paid February 14, 2022. As a result, MPLX made distributions totaling $715 million to its common unitholders. MPC’s portion of this distribution was approximately $456 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, MPLX repurchased 23 million common units at an average cost per unit of $27.52 and paid $630 million of cash. As of December 31, 2021, $337 million remained available under the authorization for future repurchases.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.

OVERVIEW OF SEGMENTS

Refining & Marketing

Refining & Marketing segment income from operations depends largely on our Refining & Marketing margin, refining operating costs, refining planned turnarounds, distribution costs, depreciation expenses and refinery throughputs. Our total refining capacity was 2,887 mbpcd, 2,874 mbpcd and 3,067 mbpcd as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Our Refining & Marketing margin is the difference between the prices of refined products sold and the costs of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks refined, including the costs to transport these inputs to our refineries and the costs of products purchased for resale. The crack spread is a measure of the difference between market prices for refined products and crude oil, commonly used by the industry as a proxy for the refining margin. Crack spreads can fluctuate significantly, particularly when prices of refined products do not move in the same relationship as the cost of crude oil. As a performance benchmark and a comparison with other industry participants, we calculate Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads that we believe most closely track our operations and slate of products. The following will be used for these crack-spread calculations:

•The Gulf Coast crack spread uses three barrels of MEH crude producing two barrels of USGC CBOB gasoline and one barrel of USGC ULSD. In the first quarter of 2021, we transitioned to MEH crude from LLS crude; 

•The Mid-Continent crack spread uses three barrels of WTI crude producing two barrels of Chicago CBOB gasoline and one barrel of Chicago ULSD; and

•The West Coast crack spread uses three barrels of ANS crude producing two barrels of LA CARBOB and one barrel of LA CARB Diesel.

Our refineries process a variety of sweet and sour grades of crude oil, which typically can be purchased at a discount to the crude oils referenced in our Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast crack spreads. The amount of these discounts, which we refer to as the sweet differential and the sour differential, can vary significantly, causing our Refining & Marketing margin to differ from blended crack spreads. In general, larger sweet and sour differentials will enhance our Refining & Marketing margin.

Future crude oil differentials will be dependent on a variety of market and economic factors, as well as U.S. energy policy.

The following table provides sensitivities showing an estimated change in annual net income due to potential changes in market conditions. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Crack spread based on 40 percent MEH, 40 percent WTI and 20 percent ANS with Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent and West Coast product pricing, respectively, and assumes all other differentials and pricing relationships remain unchanged.

(b)Sour crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: ANS, Argus Sour Crude Index, Maya and Western Canadian Select. We assume approximately 50 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2022 will be sour crude.

(c)Sweet crude oil basket consists of the following crudes: Bakken, Brent, MEH, WTI-Cushing and WTI-Midland. We assume approximately 50 percent of the crude processed at our refineries in 2022 will be sweet crude.

(d)This is consumption based exposure for our Refining & Marketing segment and does not include the sales exposure for our Midstream segment. 

44
In addition to the market changes indicated by the crack spreads, the sour differential and the sweet differential, our Refining & Marketing margin is impacted by factors such as:

•the selling prices realized for refined products;

•the types of crude oil and other charge and blendstocks processed;

•our refinery yields;

•the cost of products purchased for resale; 

•the impact of commodity derivative instruments used to hedge price risk; 

•the potential impact of LCM adjustments to inventories in periods of declining prices: and

•the potential impact of LIFO liquidation charges due to draw-downs from historic inventory levels.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs of crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products are stated under the LIFO inventory costing method and aggregated on a consolidated basis for purposes of assessing if the cost basis of these inventories may have to be written down to market values. At December 31, 2021, market values for refined products exceed their cost basis and, therefore, there is no LCM inventory valuation reserve at the end of the year. Based on movements of refined product prices, future inventory valuation adjustments could have a negative effect to earnings. Such losses are subject to reversal in subsequent periods if prices recover.

Refining & Marketing segment income from operations is also affected by changes in refining operating costs and refining planned turnaround costs in addition to committed distribution costs. Changes in operating costs are primarily driven by the cost of energy used by our refineries, including purchased natural gas, and the level of maintenance costs. Refining planned turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. Distribution costs primarily include long-term agreements with MPLX, as discussed below, which are based on committed volumes and will negatively impact income from operations in periods when throughput or sales are lower or refineries are idled.

The following table lists the refineries that had significant planned turnaround and major maintenance activities for each of the last three years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We have various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with MPLX. Under these agreements, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, provides transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services to our Refining & Marketing segment. Certain of these agreements include commitments for minimum quarterly throughput and distribution volumes of crude oil and refined products and minimum storage volumes of crude oil, refined products and other products. Certain other agreements include commitments to pay for 100 percent of available capacity for certain marine transportation and refining logistics assets. 

Midstream

Our Midstream segment transports, stores, distributes and markets crude oil and refined products, principally for our Refining & Marketing segment. The profitability of our pipeline transportation operations primarily depends on tariff rates and the volumes shipped through the pipelines. The profitability of our marine operations primarily depends on the quantity and availability of our vessels and barges. The profitability of our light product terminal operations primarily depends on the throughput volumes at these terminals. The profitability of our fuels distribution services primarily depends on the sales volumes of certain refined products. The profitability of our refining logistics operations depends on the quantity and availability of our refining logistics assets. A majority of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our pipelines and marine vessels and the refined product throughput at our terminals serve our Refining & Marketing segment. Our refining logistics assets and fuels distribution services are used solely by our Refining & Marketing segment.

As discussed above in the Refining & Marketing section, MPLX, which is reported in our Midstream segment, has various long-term, fee-based commercial agreements related to services provided to our Refining & Marketing segment. Under these agreements, MPLX has received various commitments of minimum throughput, storage and distribution volumes as well as commitments to pay for all available capacity of certain assets. The volume of crude oil that we transport is directly affected by the supply of, and refiner demand for, crude oil in the markets served directly by our crude oil pipelines, terminals and marine operations. Key factors in this supply and demand balance are the production levels of crude oil by producers in various regions or fields, the availability and cost of alternative modes of transportation, the volumes of crude oil processed at refineries and refinery and transportation system maintenance levels. The volume of refined products that we transport, store, distribute and market is directly affected by the production levels of, and user demand for, refined products in the markets served by our refined product pipelines and marine operations. In most of our markets, demand for gasoline and distillate peaks during the summer 

45
driving season, which extends from May through September of each year, and declines during the fall and winter months. As with crude oil, other transportation alternatives and system maintenance levels influence refined product movements. 

Our Midstream segment also gathers and processes natural gas and NGLs. NGL and natural gas prices are volatile and are impacted by changes in fundamental supply and demand, as well as market uncertainty, availability of NGL transportation and fractionation capacity and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. Our Midstream segment profitability is affected by prevailing commodity prices primarily as a result of processing or conditioning at our own or third‑party processing plants, purchasing and selling or gathering and transporting volumes of natural gas at index‑related prices and the cost of third‑party transportation and fractionation services. To the extent that commodity prices influence the level of natural gas drilling by our producer customers, such prices also affect profitability.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion includes comments and analysis relating to our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and is intended to provide investors with a reasonable basis for assessing our historical operations, but should not serve as the only criteria for predicting our future performance. 

Consolidated Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)In accordance with discontinued operations accounting, Speedway sales to retail customers and net results are reflected in Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, and Refining & Marketing intercompany sales to Speedway are presented as third-party sales through the close of the sale on May 14, 2021.

2021 Compared to 2020 

Net income attributable to MPC increased $19.56 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to the gain on the sale of Speedway, the absence of impairment expenses and a LIFO liquidation charge and increases in average refined product sales 

46
prices and volumes, partially offset by a partial period of income from discontinued operations due to the sale of the Speedway business on May 14, 2021. See Segment Results for additional information.

Total revenues and other income increased $51.90 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to:

•increased sales and other operating revenues of $50.20 billion primarily due to increased average refined product sales prices of $0.80 per gallon, or 65 percent, and refined product sales volumes of 203 mbpd, or 6 percent, largely due to continuing economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020;

•increased income from equity method investments of $1.39 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion in 2020 primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices; and

•increased other income of $350 million primarily due to higher income on RIN sales.

Total costs and expenses increased $35.35 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to:

•increased cost of revenues of $44.28 billion primarily due to higher refined product sales volumes in addition to higher crude oil and refined product raw material costs, partially offset by the absence of a LIFO liquidation charge in 2020 of $561 million;

•decreased impairment expense of $8.43 billion due to impairments recorded for goodwill and long-lived assets in 2020 primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices in the prior year; 

•decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $173 million mainly due to cost reductions realized from our 2020 workforce reduction and other cost control efforts; and

•decreased restructuring expenses of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction in 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 for additional information.

Net interest and other financial costs increased $118 million largely due to debt retirement expenses related to the redemption of MPC senior notes and pension settlement losses of $75 million, partially offset by decreased interest expense due to lower MPLX and MPC borrowings. We capitalized interest of $73 million in 2021 and $129 million in 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 for further details.

We recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $264 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was lower than the tax computed at the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to certain permanent tax benefits related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and a change in benefit related to the net operating loss (“NOL”) carryback provided under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), partially offset by state taxes. We recorded a combined federal, state and foreign income tax benefit of $2.43 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is lower than the tax computed at the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the NOL carryback provided under the CARES Act. Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 14 for further details.

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $1.40 billion mainly due to an increase in MPLX’s net income largely due to impairment expense recognized during 2020.

2020 Compared to 2019 

Net income attributable to MPC decreased $12.46 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to impairment expenses for goodwill and long-lived assets of $8.43 billion, impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion, decreased refined product sales volumes, prices and margin, a charge of $561 million to reflect a LIFO liquidation in our crude oil and refined product inventories and restructuring expenses of $367 million. These changes were partially offset by reduced operating costs and increased income from discontinued operations, which represents the Speedway business. See Segment Results for additional information.

Total revenues and other income decreased $42.83 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:

•decreased sales and other operating revenues of $41.37 billion primarily due to decreased Refining & Marketing segment refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, or 14 percent, and lower average refined product sales prices, which decreased $0.55 per gallon, or 31 percent, largely due to reduced travel and business operations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic;

•decreased income from equity method investments of $1.25 billion largely due to impairments of equity method investments of $1.32 billion primarily driven by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the decline in commodity prices; and 

47
•decreased net gain on disposal of assets of $208 million mainly due to the absence of $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline Pipeline Company LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets in 2019. This decrease was offset by net gains on disposal of assets in 2020 largely due to the sale of three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets.

Total costs and expenses decreased $26.12 billion in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:

•decreased cost of revenues of $33.50 billion primarily due to reduced business operations and travel associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased cost of revenues of $561 million to reflect LIFO liquidations for our crude oil and refined product inventories. The costs of inventories in the historical LIFO layers liquidated were higher than current costs, which resulted in the LIFO liquidation charge;

•impairment expense of $8.43 billion recorded in 2020 for goodwill and long-lived assets of $7.39 billion and $1.03 billion, respectively, primarily driven by the effects of COVID-19 and the decline in commodity prices. It also includes impairment of long-lived assets primarily related to the repositioning of the Martinez refinery compared to impairment expense of $1.20 billion recorded in 2019 primarily related to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition; 

•decreased selling, general and administrative expenses of $482 million mainly due to decreases in salaries and employee-related expenses, transaction-related expenses, credit card processing fees for brand customers and contract services expenses;

•restructuring expense of $367 million related to the idling of the Martinez and Gallup refineries and costs related to our announced workforce reduction. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 for additional information; and

•increased other taxes of $107 million primarily due to increased property and environmental taxes of approximately $78 million and $69 million, respectively. Property taxes increased in the current period mainly due to the absence of property tax refunds and tax exemptions received in 2019 and environmental taxes increased largely due to the reinstatement of the Oil Spill Tax in 2020, which was not in effect for all of 2019. These increases were offset by a state tax refund and reduced payroll tax expenses.

Net interest and other financial costs increased $136 million largely due to increased MPC borrowings and foreign currency exchange losses and decreased interest income. We capitalized interest of $129 million in 2020 and $158 million in 2019. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 13 for further details.

Provision for income taxes on continuing operations decreased $3.21 billion primarily due to decreased income before taxes of $16.85 billion. The effective tax rate of 18 percent in 2020 is lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to a significant amount of our pre-tax loss consisting of non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charges, partially offset by the tax rate differential resulting from the expected NOL carryback provided under the CARES Act. Additionally, our effective tax rate is generally benefited by our noncontrolling interest in MPLX, but this benefit was lower for the year ended December 31, 2020 due to goodwill and other impairment charges recorded by MPLX. The effective tax rate of 24 percent in 2019 is higher than the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent, primarily due to permanent tax differences related to goodwill impairment and state and local tax expense, partially offset by permanent tax differences related to net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 14 for further details.

Noncontrolling interests decreased $769 million mainly due to MPLX’s net loss primarily resulting from impairment expense recognized during 2020.

The following table presents certain benchmark prices in our marketing areas and market indicators that we believe are helpful in understanding the results of our Refining & Marketing segment. The benchmark crack spreads below do not reflect the market cost of RINs necessary to meet EPA renewable volume obligations for attributable products under the Renewable Fuel Standard.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The blended crack spreads for 2021 and the fourth quarter of 2020 are weighted 40 percent of the USGC crack spread, 40 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 20 percent of the West Coast crack spread. The blended crack spreads for the first three quarters of 2020 and all of 2019 are weighted 38 percent of the USGC crack spread, 38 percent of the Mid-Continent crack spread and 24 percent of the West Coast crack spread. These blends are based on MPC’s refining capacity by region in each period. Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, the prompt price for USGC was transitioned from LLS to MEH.

2021 Compared to 2020 

Refining & Marketing segment revenues increased $49.25 billion primarily due to increased average refined product sales prices of $0.80 per gallon and higher refined product sales volumes, which increased 203 mbpd.

Refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 91 percent during 2021 and net refinery throughputs increased 216 mbpd primarily due to continuing economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

Refining & Marketing segment income from operations increased $6.21 billion primarily driven by higher blended crack spreads.

Refining & Marketing margin, excluding LIFO liquidation charge, was $13.36 per barrel for 2021 compared to $8.96 per barrel for 2020. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net positive impact of $5.0 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to higher crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $700 million, including the LIFO liquidation charge, in 2021 compared to 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization and storm impacts, were $5.13 billion. This was a decrease of $241 million, or $0.66 per barrel, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including idling portions of our refining capacity, partially offset by an increase in energy costs largely as a result of higher natural gas prices. 

Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.15 billion and $5.08 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.47 billion and $3.46 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. On a per barrel basis, distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, decreased $0.33 due to increased throughput.

51
Refining planned turnaround costs decreased $250 million, or $0.31 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity and an increase in throughput. 

Depreciation and amortization per barrel decreased by $0.13, primarily due to an increase in throughput partially offset by an increase in costs.

We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $1.49 billion in 2021 and $606 million in 2020 and are included in Refining & Marketing margin. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs.

2020 Compared to 2019 

Refining & Marketing segment revenues decreased $41.16 billion primarily due to lower refined product sales volumes, which decreased 513 mbpd, and decreased average refined product sales prices of $0.55 per gallon. 

Refinery crude oil capacity utilization was 82 percent during 2020 and net refinery throughputs decreased 529 mbpd primarily due to reducing throughputs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Refining & Marketing segment income from operations decreased $8.05 billion primarily driven by lower blended crack spreads.

Refining & Marketing margin, excluding LIFO liquidation charge, was $8.96 per barrel for 2020 compared to $14.77 per barrel for 2019. Refining & Marketing margin is affected by the market indicators shown earlier, which use spot market values and an estimated mix of crude purchases and product sales. Based on the market indicators and our crude oil throughput, we estimate a net negative impact of $9.75 billion on Refining & Marketing margin, primarily due to lower crack spreads. Our reported Refining & Marketing margin differs from market indicators due to the mix of crudes purchased and their costs, the effects of market structure on our crude oil acquisition prices, RIN prices on the crack spread and other items like refinery yields and other feedstock variances, direct dealer fuel margin, and for 2020, a LIFO liquidation charge of $561 million. For 2019, the Refining & Marketing segment income from operations also reflects a benefit of $93 million for the biodiesel tax credit attributable to volumes blended in 2018. These factors had an estimated net positive impact on Refining & Marketing segment income from operations of approximately $800 million, including the LIFO liquidation charge, in 2020 compared to 2019. 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, refining operating costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.37 billion. This was a decrease of $1.06 billion, and a per barrel increase of $0.02 due to lower refinery throughput, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 as we took actions to reduce costs in response to the economic effects of COVID-19, including operating at lower throughput at our refineries and idling portions of our refining capacity. Net refinery throughput was 529 mbpd lower in 2020.

Distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, were $5.08 billion and $5.13 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and include fees paid to MPLX of $3.46 billion and $3.22 billion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. On a per barrel basis, distribution costs, excluding depreciation and amortization, increased $0.85 primarily due to lower throughput partially offset by a decrease in costs. 

Refining planned turnaround costs increased $92 million, or $0.23 per barrel, due to the timing of turnaround activity and a decrease in throughput. 

Depreciation and amortization per barrel increased by $0.38, primarily due to a decrease in throughput and increased costs.

We purchase RINs to satisfy a portion of our RFS2 compliance. Our expenses associated with purchased RINs were $606 million in 2020 and $356 million in 2019 and are included in Refining & Marketing margin. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to higher weighted average RIN costs, partially offset by a decrease in our RIN obligations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)C2 + NGL pricing based on Mont Belvieu prices assuming an NGL barrel of approximately 35 percent ethane, 35 percent propane, six percent Iso-Butane, 12 percent normal butane and 12 percent natural gasoline.

2021 Compared to 2020 

Midstream segment revenue and segment income from operations increased $1.18 billion and $353 million, respectively. Results benefited from higher revenue, primarily due to higher natural gas prices, higher pipeline and terminal throughputs and lower operating expenses, partially offset by a decrease in marine transportation fees. 

2020 Compared to 2019 

Midstream segment revenue decreased $322 million primarily due to decreased demand for the products that we produce and transport due to macro-economic conditions in 2020 in addition to lower natural gas prices.

In 2020, Midstream segment income from operations increased $114 million mainly due to stable, fee-based earnings in the 2020 business environment, contributions from organic growth projects and reduced operating expenses. 

Corporate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Corporate costs consist primarily of MPC’s corporate administrative expenses and costs related to certain non-operating assets, except for corporate overhead expenses attributable to MPLX, which are included in the Midstream segment. 

2021 Compared to 2020 

Corporate expenses decreased $104 million in 2021 compared to 2020 largely due to cost reductions realized from our 2020 workforce reduction and other cost control efforts.

2020 Compared to 2019 

Corporate expenses decreased $33 million in 2020 compared to 2019 largely due to decreased salaries and contract services expenses, partially offset by increased expenses due to an information systems integration project. 2020 and 2019 corporate expenses include expenses of $26 million and $28 million, respectively, which are no longer allocable to Speedway due to discontinued operations accounting. 

Items not Allocated to Segments

Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the performance of our segments using segment income from operations. Items identified in the table below are either believed to be non-recurring in nature or not believed to be allocable, controlled by the segment or are not tied to the operational performance of the segment. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)2020 and 2019 include costs incurred in connection with the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts. 2019 includes employee severance, retention and other costs related to the acquisition of Andeavor. Costs incurred in connection with the Speedway separation are included in discontinued operations.

2021 Compared to 2020 

Total items not allocated to segments included impairment expense of $81 million related to the divestiture, abandonment or closure of certain assets within our Midstream segment. 

55
Unallocated items in 2020 include impairment charges of $9.74 billion which includes $8.43 billion related to goodwill and long-lived assets and $1.32 billion related to equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7 for additional information.

During 2020, we indefinitely idled our Gallup refinery, initiated actions to strategically reposition our Martinez refinery to a renewable diesel facility and approved an involuntary workforce reduction plan. In connection with these strategic actions, we recorded restructuring expenses of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 for additional information.

Other unallocated items in 2020 include a favorable litigation settlement of $84 million and gain on sale of assets of $66 million related to the sale of three asphalt terminals and certain other Refining & Marketing assets. 

2020 Compared to 2019 

Unallocated items in 2019 include $259 million of non-cash gains related to obtaining equity investments in Capline LLC and The Andersons in exchange for contributing assets. 

In 2019, other unallocated items also include transaction-related costs of $153 million and a litigation reserve adjustment of $22 million. The transaction-related costs recognized during the year include the recognition of an obligation for vacation benefits provided to former Andeavor employees in the first quarter as well as employee retention, severance and other costs and the Midstream strategic review and other related efforts.

Impairment charges of $1.24 billion in 2019 primarily relate to MPLX goodwill associated with the ANDX gathering and processing businesses acquired as part of the Andeavor acquisition. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measure

Management uses a financial measure to evaluate our operating performance that is calculated and presented on the basis of methodologies other than in accordance with GAAP. We believe this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors and analysts to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to its most comparable GAAP financial measure, it provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. This measure should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measure we use is as follows:

Refining & Marketing Margin

Refining margin is defined as sales revenue less the cost of refinery inputs and purchased products and excludes other items reflected in the table below.

Reconciliation of Refining & Marketing income (loss) from operations to Refining & Marketing gross margin and Refining & Marketing margin

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash Flows

Our cash and cash equivalents balance for continuing operations was $5.29 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to $415 million at December 31, 2020. Cash and cash equivalents for discontinued operations was $140 million at December 31, 2020. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the past three years is presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Continuing Operations

Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased $7.58 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to an increase in operating results and a favorable change in working capital of $633 million. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $7.17 billion in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in operating results and an unfavorable change in working capital of $43 million. The above changes in working capital exclude changes in short-term debt. 

For 2021, changes in working capital were a net $947 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes at the end of the year on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to increases in crude prices and volumes. Current receivables increased primarily due to higher crude and refined product prices and volumes.

For 2020, changes in working capital were a net $314 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of decreases in energy commodity prices, inventory and refined product volumes on working capital. Accounts payable decreased primarily due to lower crude payable prices. Current receivables decreased primarily due to lower crude and refined product receivable prices and refined product volumes. Inventories decreased mainly due to decreases in refined product, crude and materials and supplies inventories.

For 2019, changes in working capital were a net $357 million source of cash, primarily due to the effect of increases in energy commodity prices and volumes on working capital. Accounts payable increased primarily due to higher crude oil payable prices and volumes. Current receivables increased primarily due to increases in crude and refined product receivable volumes and prices. Inventories increased primarily due to increases in refined product and materials and supplies inventories partially offset by a decrease in crude inventory.

Discontinued Operations

Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations was $4.02 billion in 2021 primarily due to tax payments related to the sale of Speedway, partially offset by a partial year of business income due to the sale of Speedway on May 14, 2021. Net cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations in 2020 and 2019 include Speedway business income.

Investing Activities

Continuing Operations

Net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations were $6.52 billion, $2.92 billion and $5.78 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

•In 2021, proceeds from the sale of Speedway were used to purchase $12.50 billion of short-term investments and cash of $5.41 billion and $1.54 billion was provided by the maturities and sales, respectively, of short-term investments. The cash provided by maturities and sales of short-term investments was primarily used to fund our return of capital initiatives announced as part of the Speedway sale.

57
•Cash used for additions to property, plant and equipment was $1.46 billion in 2021, compared to $2.79 billion in 2020 and $4.81 billion in 2019, primarily due to spending in our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments in 2021. See discussion of capital expenditures and investments under the “Capital Spending” section.

•Net investments were a use of cash of $171 million in 2021 compared to $348 million in 2020 and $966 million in 2019. Investments in 2021 primarily include midstream projects and our joint venture with ADM. The decrease from 2020 is due to the completion of the South Texas Gateway Terminal, the Gray Oak Pipeline and the Whistler Pipeline projects which were included in 2020 net investments. Investments in 2019 are largely due to investments in connection with the Gray Oak Pipeline, which began initial start-up in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Wink to Webster Pipeline, the Whistler Pipeline and other Midstream projects. 

•Cash provided by disposal of assets totaled $153 million, $150 million and $47 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we primarily sold Midstream assets and in 2020, we sold three asphalt terminals and other Refining & Marketing assets. 

The consolidated statements of cash flows exclude changes to the consolidated balance sheets that did not affect cash. A reconciliation of additions to property, plant and equipment to total capital expenditures and investments follows for each of the last three years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Discontinued Operations

Net cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in 2021 primarily includes the $21.38 billion proceeds from the sale of Speedway, partially offset primarily by cash used for Speedway capital expenditures of $177 million. Net cash used in investing activities for discontinued operations for 2020 and 2019 primarily includes Speedway capital expenditures.

Financing Activities

Financing activities were a use of cash of $14.42 billion in 2021, $135 million in 2020 and $3.38 billion in 2019. 

•During 2021,we reduced debt through the following actions:

•On December 2, 2021, all of the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC's 4.5% senior notes due May 2023 and the $850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 4.75% senior notes due December 2023, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor LLC was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par, plus a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. MPC funded the redemption amount with cash on hand.

•In June 2021,we redeemed all of the $300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due April 2024 at a price equal to 100.854% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.

•In May 2021, we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which, along with cash had been used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of MPC’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of $1.13 billion.

•On March 1, 2021, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due March 2021.

•In 2021, MPLX redeemed $1.75 billion of senior notes and had net borrowings of $300 million under its revolving credit facility. 

•During 2020, MPC issued $2.5 billion of senior notes, redeemed $1.13 billion of senior notes, borrowed and repaid $4.23 billion under its revolving credit facility and borrowed and repaid $3.55 billion under its trade receivables facility. MPLX issued $3.0 billion of senior notes, which were used to repay $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under its term loan, $1.0 billion of floating rate senior notes and to redeem $750 million of fixed rate senior notes, and had net borrowings of $175 million under its revolving credit facility. 

58
•During 2019, MPLX issued $2.0 billion of floating rate notes, the proceeds of which were used to repay various outstanding MPLX borrowings and for general business purposes, and had net borrowings of $1.0 billion under its term loan agreement. In addition, MPLX repaid $500 million of senior notes. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for additional information on our long-term debt.

•Cash used in common stock repurchases totaled $4.65 billion in 2021 and $1.95 billion in 2019. See the “Capital Requirements” section for further discussion of our stock repurchases.

•Cash used in dividend payments totaled $1.48 billion in 2021, $1.51 billion in 2020 and $1.40 billion in 2019. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to an increase in our base dividend, partially offset by a reduction of shares resulting from share repurchases in 2019. Dividends per share were $2.32 in 2021, $2.32 in 2020 and $2.12 in 2019.

•Cash used in distributions to noncontrolling interests totaled $1.45 billion in 2021, $1.24 billion in 2020 and $1.25 billion in 2019. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to an increase in MPLX’s distribution per common unit, mainly due to a special distribution amount of $0.5750 per common unit in the third quarter of 2021, partially offset by a reduction of MPLX common units resulting from common unit repurchases in 2021 and 2020.

•Cash used in repurchases of noncontrolling interests increased $597 million in 2021 compared to 2020 due to MPLX’s repurchases of its common units. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 for additional information on MPLX.

Derivative Instruments

See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for a discussion of derivative instruments and associated market risk.

Capital Resources

MPC, Excluding MPLX

We control MPLX through our ownership of the general partner, however, the creditors of MPLX do not have recourse to MPC’s general credit through guarantees or other financial arrangements. The assets of MPLX can only be used to settle its own obligations and its creditors have no recourse to our assets. Therefore, in the following table, we present the liquidity of MPC, excluding MPLX. MPLX liquidity is discussed in the following section.

Our liquidity, excluding MPLX, totaled $15.83 billion at December 31, 2021 consisting of:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Outstanding borrowings include $1 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility. 

(b)The committed capacity of the trade receivables securitization facility is $100 million. The facility allows the banks to make loans and issue letters of credit of up to $400 million in excess of the committed capacity at their discretion if there is available borrowing capacity. Outstanding borrowings include $250 million in letters of credit outstanding under this facility.

(c)Excludes $13 million of MPLX cash and cash equivalents. 

Because of the alternatives available to us, including internally generated cash flow and access to capital markets and a commercial paper program, we believe that our short-term and long-term liquidity is adequate to fund not only our current operations, but also our near-term (less than twelve months) and long-term funding requirements, including capital spending programs, the repurchase of shares of our common stock, dividend payments, defined benefit plan contributions, repayment of debt maturities and other amounts that may ultimately be paid in connection with contingencies. 

On May 14, 2021, we completed the sale of Speedway, our company-owned and operated retail transportation fuel and convenience store business, to 7-Eleven for cash proceeds of $21.38 billion. This transaction resulted in a pretax gain of $11.68 billion ($8.02 billion after income taxes) after deducting the book value of the net assets and certain other adjustments. We utilized a portion of the Speedway sale net proceeds to structurally reduce debt and return capital to shareholders through share repurchases. The remaining proceeds are included in our liquidity as cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments.

During 2021, we reduced debt through the following actions:

•On December 2, 2021, all of the $1.25 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC's 4.5% senior notes due May 2023 and the $850 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 4.75% senior notes due December 

59
2023, including the portion of such notes for which Andeavor LLC was the obligor, were redeemed at a price equal to par, plus a make-whole premium calculated in accordance with the terms of the senior notes and accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. MPC funded the redemption amount with cash on hand.

•In June 2021, we redeemed all of the $300 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due April 2024 at a price equal to 100.854% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date.

•In May 2021, we repaid all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, which, along with cash had been, used to finance the fourth quarter 2020 repayments of two series of MPC’s senior notes in the aggregate total principal amount of $1.13 billion.

•On March 1, 2021, we repaid the $1 billion outstanding aggregate principal amount of MPC’s 5.125% senior notes due March 2021. 

Effective June 18, 2021, we terminated our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day revolving credit facility due in September 2021 and on June 23, 2021, we reduced the capacity under our trade receivables securitization facility from $750 million to $100 million. On September 30, 2021, we entered into a new trade receivables securitization facility, which provides for committed borrowing and letter of credit issuing capacity of up to $100 million and uncommitted capacity up to $400 million. This facility replaces our previous trade receivables securitization facility that expired on July 16, 2021. 

We have a commercial paper program that allows us to have a maximum of $2.0 billion in commercial paper outstanding, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. We do not intend to have outstanding commercial paper borrowings in excess of available capacity under our bank revolving credit facilities. At December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program.

The MPC credit agreement and trade receivables facility contain representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants and events of default that we consider usual and customary for agreements of these types. The financial covenant included in the MPC credit agreement requires us to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization (as defined in the MPC credit agreement) of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. Other covenants restrict us and/or certain of our subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants contained in the MPC credit agreement and our trade receivables facility, including the financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Net Debt to Total Capitalization of 0.08 to 1.00.

Our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile. As of February 1, 2022, the credit ratings on our senior unsecured debt are as follows.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.

The MPC credit agreement does not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of our senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements and may limit our flexibility to obtain financing in the future, including to refinance existing indebtedness. In addition, a downgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating to below investment-grade levels could, under certain circumstances, impact our ability to purchase crude oil on an unsecured basis and could result in us having to post letters of credit under existing transportation services or other agreements.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for further discussion of our debt.

60
MPLX 

MPLX’s liquidity totaled $3.26 billion at December 31, 2021 consisting of:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On September 3, 2021 MPLX redeemed, at par value, all of the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due September 2022. MPLX primarily funded the redemption with borrowings under the MPC intercompany loan agreement.

The MPLX credit agreement contains certain representations and warranties, affirmative and restrictive covenants and events of default that we consider to be usual and customary for an agreement of this type. The financial covenant requires MPLX to maintain a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter to Consolidated EBITDA (both as defined in the MPLX credit agreement) for the prior four fiscal quarters of no greater than 5.0 to 1.0 (or 5.5 to 1.0 for up to two fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions). Consolidated EBITDA is subject to adjustments for certain acquisitions completed and capital projects undertaken during the relevant period. Other covenants restrict MPLX and/or certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt, creating liens on assets and entering into transactions with affiliates. As of December 31, 2021, MPLX was in compliance with the covenants, including the financial covenant with a ratio of Consolidated Total Debt to Consolidated EBITDA of 3.7 to 1.0.

Our intention is to maintain an investment-grade credit profile for MPLX. As of February 1, 2022, the credit ratings on MPLX’s senior unsecured debt are as follows.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies. Although it is our intention to maintain a credit profile that supports an investment-grade rating for MPLX, there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time. The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.

The agreements governing MPLX’s debt obligations do not contain credit rating triggers that would result in the acceleration of interest, principal or other payments in the event that MPLX credit ratings are downgraded. However, any downgrades of MPLX senior unsecured debt could increase the applicable interest rates, yields and other fees payable under such agreements. In addition, a downgrade of MPLX senior unsecured debt ratings to below investment-grade levels may limit MPLX’s ability to obtain future financing, including to refinance existing indebtedness. 

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for further discussion of MPLX’s debt.

Capital Requirements

Capital Spending

MPC’s capital investment plan for 2022 totals approximately $1.7 billion for capital projects and investments, excluding capitalized interest, potential acquisitions and MPLX’s capital investment plan. MPC’s 2022 capital investment plan includes all of the planned capital spending for Refining & Marketing, and Corporate as well as a portion of the planned capital investments for Midstream. The remainder of the planned capital spending for Midstream reflects the capital investment plan for MPLX. We continuously evaluate our capital plan and make changes as conditions warrant. The 2022 capital investment plan for MPC and MPLX and capital expenditures and investments for each of the last three years are summarized by segment below.

61
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Capital expenditures include changes in capital accruals.

(b)Excludes capitalized interest of $68 million, $106 million and $137 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2022 capital investment plan excludes capitalized interest.

Refining & Marketing

The Refining & Marketing segment’s forecasted 2022 capital spending and investments is approximately $1.63 billion. This amount includes approximately $800 million of growth capital for renewables projects, primarily the Martinez facility conversion, and $525 million of growth capital focused on on-going projects such as the STAR project and projects that we expect will help us reduce future operating costs. Maintenance capital is expected to be approximately $300 million which is essential to maintain the safety, integrity and reliability of our assets.

Major capital projects completed over the last three years have focused on refinery optimization, production of higher value products, increased capacity to upgrade residual fuel oil and expanded export capacity. We also focused on projects such as the Martinez facility conversion, the STAR project at our Galveston Bay refinery, which is scheduled to complete in 2022, and projects expected to reduce future operating costs.

Midstream 

MPLX’s capital investment plan includes approximately $700 million of organic growth capital, $140 million of maintenance capital and a $60 million investment in unconsolidated affiliates for the repayment of MPLX’s 9.19 percent indirect share of the Bakken Pipeline joint venture’s debt due in 2022. The growth capital plan is directed towards logistics projects in support of MPC’s Martinez Renewable Fuels project, projects in the Permian and Bakken basins and investments in the Permian basin supporting the BANGL and Whistler pipelines. These long-haul NGL and natural gas logistics systems transport product to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Other growth projects include the addition of approximately 200 MMcf/d of processing capacity in the Delaware basin in the Permian to meet increasing producer customer demand and 68 mbpd of de-ethanization capacity in the Marcellus, both of which are expected to be completed in 2022.

Major capital projects over the last three years included investments for the development of natural gas and natural gas liquids infrastructure to support MPLX’s producer customers, primarily in the Marcellus, Utica and Permian regions and development of various crude oil and refined petroleum products infrastructure projects.

The remaining Midstream segment’s forecasted 2022 capital spend, excluding MPLX, is approximately $10 million which primarily relates to investments in equity affiliates.

Corporate and Other

The 2022 capital forecast includes approximately $100 million to support corporate activities. Major projects over the last three years included upgrades to information technology systems.

Share Repurchases

Since January 1, 2012, our board of directors has approved $25.05 billion in total share repurchase authorizations and we have repurchased a total of $19.78 billion of our common stock, leaving approximately $5.27 billion available for repurchases as of December 31, 2021. On February 2, 2022, we announced our board of directors approved an incremental $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization. The authorization has no expiration date. The table below summarizes our total share repurchases. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 11 for further discussion of the share repurchase plans.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated share repurchases or open market solicitations for shares, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of future repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and such repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

MPLX Unit Repurchases

During the year ended December 31, 2021, MPLX repurchased 23 million common units at an average cost per unit of $27.52 and paid $630 million of cash. As of December 31, 2021, $337 million remained under the authorization for future repurchases.

MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 6 for further discussion of the MPLX unit repurchase program.

Cash Commitments 

Contractual Obligations

We have purchase commitments primarily consisting of obligations to purchase and transport crude oil used in our refining operations. As of December 31, 2021, we had purchase obligations for crude oil of $15.13 billion, with $14.66 billion payable within 12 months, and crude oil transportation obligations of $7.28 billion, with $451 million payable within 12 months. These contracts include variable price arrangements. For purposes of this disclosure we have estimated prices to be paid primarily based on futures curves for the commodities to the extent available. Our contractual obligations do not include our contractual obligations to MPLX under various fee-based commercial agreements as these transactions are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

At December 31, 2021, we have non-cancelable obligations to acquire property, plant and equipment of $565 million, with $543 million payable within 12 months. 

At December 31, 2021, we have aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt of $25.35 billion, with $500 million payable within 12 months. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 for additional information on our debt.

Our other contractual obligations primarily consist of finance and operating leases and pension and post-retirement obligations, for which additional information is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes 28 and 26, respectively.

Other Cash Commitments

On January 27, 2022, we announced our board of directors approved a $0.58 per share dividend, payable March 10, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 16, 2022.

We may, from time to time, repurchase our senior notes and preferred units in the open market, in tender offers, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise in such volumes, at such prices and upon such other terms as we deem appropriate.

TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS 

We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations. If these expenditures, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of our products and services, our operating results will be adversely affected. We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations. However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas, production processes and whether it is also engaged in the petrochemical business or the marine transportation of crude oil and refined products.

Legislation and regulations pertaining to fuel specifications, climate change and greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including costs of compliance and permitting delays. The extent and magnitude of these adverse impacts cannot be reliably or accurately estimated at this time because specific regulatory and legislative requirements have not been finalized and uncertainty exists with respect to the measures being considered, the costs and the time frames for compliance, and our ability to pass compliance costs on to our customers.

Our environmental expenditures, including non-regulatory expenditures, for each of the last three years were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Based on the American Petroleum Institute’s definition of environmental expenditures.

(b)These amounts include spending charged against remediation reserves, where permissible, but exclude non-cash provisions recorded for environmental remediation.

We accrue for environmental remediation activities when the responsibility to remediate is probable and the amount of associated costs can be reasonably estimated. As environmental remediation matters proceed toward ultimate resolution or as additional remediation obligations arise, charges in excess of those previously accrued may be required.

New or expanded environmental requirements, which could increase our environmental costs, may arise in the future. It is not possible to predict all of the ultimate costs of compliance, including remediation costs that may be incurred and penalties that may be imposed.

Our environmental capital expenditures accounted for 8 percent, 6 percent and 12 percent of capital expenditures, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, excluding acquisitions. Our environmental capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $32 million, or 1 percent, of total planned capital expenditures in 2022. Actual expenditures may vary as the number and scope of environmental projects are revised as a result of improved technology or changes in regulatory requirements and could increase if additional projects are identified or additional requirements are imposed. 

For more information on environmental regulations that impact us, or could impact us, see Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters and Item 1A. Risk Factors.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the respective reporting periods. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and (2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used.

Fair Value Estimates

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value amount using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often 

64
referred to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence.

The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:

•Level 1 – Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

•Level 2 – Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.

•Level 3 – Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data and may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.

Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. We use an income or market approach for recurring fair value measurements and endeavor to use the best information available. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20 for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.

Significant uses of fair value measurements include:

•assessment of impairment of long-lived assets;

•assessment of impairment of intangible assets:

•assessment of impairment of goodwill;

•assessment of impairment of equity method investments;

•recorded values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions; and

•recorded values of derivative instruments.

Impairment Assessments of Long-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets, Goodwill and Equity Method Investments

Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our long-lived assets, intangible assets, goodwill and equity method investments for impairment is estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted financial information prepared using significant assumptions including:

•Future operating performance. Our estimates of future operating performance are based on our analysis of various supply and demand factors, which include, among other things, industry-wide capacity, our planned utilization rate, end-user demand, capital expenditures and economic conditions. Such estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews.

•Future volumes. Our estimates of future refinery, pipeline throughput and natural gas and natural gas liquid processing volumes are based on internal forecasts prepared by our Refining & Marketing and Midstream segments operations personnel. Assumptions about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our future volumes are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic, which is difficult to forecast.

•Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. This discount rate is also compared to recent observable market transactions, if possible. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows.

•Future capital requirements. These are based on authorized spending and internal forecasts.

Assumptions about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the macroeconomic environment are inherently subjective and contingent upon the duration of the pandemic and its impact on the macroeconomic environment, which is difficult to forecast. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonable. However, actual results may differ from these projections.

The need to test for impairment can be based on several indicators, including a significant reduction in prices of or demand for products produced, a weakened outlook for profitability, a significant reduction in pipeline throughput volumes, a significant reduction in natural gas or natural gas liquids processed, a significant reduction in refining margins, other changes to contracts or 

65
changes in the regulatory environment. The following sections detail our critical accounting estimates related to impairment assessments for long-lived assets, goodwill and equity method investments.

Long-lived Asset Impairment Assessments

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on the expected undiscounted future cash flow of an asset group. For purposes of impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is the refinery and associated distribution system level for Refining & Marketing segment assets, and the plant level or pipeline system level for Midstream segment assets. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated pretax cash flows is less than the carrying value of an asset group, fair value is calculated, and the carrying value is written down to the calculated fair value. 

Goodwill Impairment Assessments

Unlike long-lived assets, goodwill is subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing at the reporting unit level. A goodwill impairment loss is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill.

At December 31, 2021, MPC had four reporting units with goodwill totaling approximately $8.26 billion. The majority of this balance is comprised of the Midstream reporting units, including $1.1 billion for the MPLX Crude Gathering reporting unit and $6.6 billion for the MPLX Transportation & Storage reporting unit. For the annual impairment assessment as of November 30, 2021, management performed only a qualitative assessment for two reporting units as we determined it was more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value. A quantitative assessment was last performed on these reporting units at March 31, 2020, which indicated fair value exceeded carrying value by approximately 52 and 270 percent. A quantitative assessment was performed for the remaining two reporting units, which resulted in the fair value of the reporting units exceeding their carrying value by 23 percent and 51 percent. The fair values of the reporting units were determined based on applying both a discounted cash flow method, or income approach, as well as a market approach. An increase of one percentage point to the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge as of November 30, 2021. For Refining & Marketing reporting units, significant assumptions used to estimate the reporting units’ fair value included estimates of future cash flows and market information for comparable assets. For Midstream reporting units, which comprise the majority of the goodwill balance, significant assumptions that were used to estimate the reporting units' fair values under the discounted cash flow method included management’s best estimates of the discount rate, as well as estimates of future cash flows, which are impacted primarily by producer customers’ development plans, which impact future volumes and capital requirements. If estimates for future cash flows, which are impacted by future margins on products produced or sold, future volumes, and capital requirements, were to decline, the overall reporting units’ fair values would decrease, resulting in potential goodwill impairment charges. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future.

Equity Method Investment Impairment Assessment

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever factors indicate an other than temporary loss in value. Factors providing evidence of such a loss include the fair value of an investment that is less than its carrying value, absence of an ability to recover the carrying value or the investee’s inability to generate income sufficient to justify our carrying value. At December 31, 2021, we had $5.41 billion of investments in equity method investments recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. 

An estimate of the sensitivity to net income resulting from impairment calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g., pricing, volumes and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. That is, unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions may be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions.

See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 16 for additional information on our equity method investments. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 18 for additional information on our goodwill and intangibles, including a table summarizing our recorded goodwill by segment. 

Derivatives

We record all derivative instruments at fair value. Substantially all of our commodity derivatives are cleared through exchanges which provide active trading information for identical derivatives and do not require any assumptions in arriving at fair value. Fair value estimation for all our derivative instruments is discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 20. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.

Variable Interest Entities

We evaluate all legal entities in which we hold an ownership or other pecuniary interest to determine if the entity is a VIE. Our interests in a VIE are referred to as variable interests. Variable interests can be contractual, ownership or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE’s assets. When we conclude that we hold an interest in 

66
a VIE we must determine if we are the entity’s primary beneficiary. A primary beneficiary is deemed to have a controlling financial interest in a VIE. This controlling financial interest is evidenced by both (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate any VIE when we determine that we are the primary beneficiary. We must disclose the nature of any interests in a VIE that is not consolidated. 

Significant judgment is exercised in determining that a legal entity is a VIE and in evaluating our interest in a VIE. We use primarily a qualitative analysis to determine if an entity is a VIE. We evaluate the entity’s need for continuing financial support; the equity holder’s lack of a controlling financial interest; and/or if an equity holder’s voting interests are disproportionate to its obligation to absorb expected losses or receive residual returns. We evaluate our interests in a VIE to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. We use a primarily qualitative analysis to determine if we are deemed to have a controlling financial interest in the VIE, either on a standalone basis or as part of a related party group. We continually monitor our interests in legal entities for changes in the design or activities of an entity and changes in our interests, including our status as the primary beneficiary to determine if the changes require us to revise our previous conclusions. 

Changes in the design or nature of the activities of a VIE, or our involvement with a VIE, may require us to reconsider our conclusions on the entity’s status as a VIE and/or our status as the primary beneficiary. Such reconsideration requires significant judgment and understanding of the organization. This could result in the deconsolidation or consolidation of the affected subsidiary, which would have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

Variable Interest Entities are discussed in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 8.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Obligations

Accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions, the most significant of which relate to the following:

•the discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations;

•the expected long-term return on plan assets;

•the rate of future increases in compensation levels; 

•health care cost projections; and

•the mortality table used in determining future plan obligations.

We utilize the work of third-party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations. We have selected different discount rates for each of our pension plans and retiree health and welfare based on the projected benefit payment patterns of each individual plan. The selected rates are compared to various similar bond indexes for reasonableness. In determining the assumed discount rates, we use our third-party actuaries’ discount rate models. These models calculate an equivalent single discount rate for the projected benefit plan cash flows using yield curves derived from Aa or higher corporate bond yields. The yield curves represent a series of annualized individual spot discount rates from 0.5 to 99 years. The bonds used have an average rating of Aa or higher from a recognized rating agency and generally only non-callable bonds are included. Outlier bonds that have a yield to maturity that deviate significantly from the average yield within each maturity grouping are not included. Each issue is required to have at least $300 million par value outstanding.

Of the assumptions used to measure the year-end obligations and estimated annual net periodic benefit cost, the discount rate has the most significant effect on the periodic benefit cost reported for the plans. Decreasing the discount rates of 2.90 percent for our pension plans and 2.75 percent for our other postretirement benefit plans by 0.25 percent would increase pension obligations and other postretirement benefit plan obligations by $104 million and $23 million, respectively, and would increase defined benefit pension expense and other postretirement benefit plan expense by $13 million and $1 million, respectively.

The long-term asset rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plans (currently targeted at approximately 50 percent equity securities and 50 percent fixed income securities for the primary funded pension plan), past performance and other factors. Certain components of the asset mix are modeled with various assumptions regarding inflation and returns. In addition, our long-term asset rate of return assumption is compared to those of other companies and to historical returns for reasonableness. We used the 5.75 percent long-term rate of return to determine our 2021 defined benefit pension expense. After evaluating activity in the capital markets, along with the current and projected plan investments, we increased the asset rate of return for our primary plan to 6.00 percent effective for 2022. Decreasing the 6.00 percent asset rate of return assumption by 0.25 percentage points would increase our defined benefit pension expense by $7 million.

Compensation change assumptions are based on historical experience, anticipated future management actions and demographics of the benefit plans.

Health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends.

We utilized the 2021 mortality tables from the U.S. Society of Actuaries.

67
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 26 includes detailed information about the assumptions used to calculate the components of our annual defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan expense, as well as the obligations and accumulated other comprehensive loss reported on the year-end balance sheets.
