The Basins are comprised of GeoUnits, which can be a single country or made up of several countries. With a strong focus on the customers, Basins identify opportunities for local growth. 

Corporate Strategy 

Schlumberger’s strategy is designed to adapt the Company to an evolving industry landscape shaped by emerging drivers, including capital discipline, regionalization of supply and demand, an efficiency imperative, and resilience—defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint. This strategy is designed to magnify Schlumberger’s ability to improve customer performance, which is the differentiating factor that will help our industry meet higher stakeholder expectations.  

Oil and gas will remain critical to economic activity and prosperity. According to the most recent International Energy Agency Sustainable Development Scenario, oil and gas are expected to represent approximately 45% of the global energy mix through 2040. Schlumberger’s role is twofold: to enable customers to produce these resources efficiently, cost effectively and with the lowest carbon footprint and to support the world’s transition to a more diversified energy mix. 

Schlumberger’s strategy is structured around three major themes, all of which are focused on customer performance: (i) strengthen the core; (ii) go-to-market; and (iii) horizons of growth. 

Strengthen the Core 

The core of Schlumberger is how we work with customers and execute our business. The elements in this theme—which include customer collaboration, the integrity and efficiency of our operations, and capital stewardship—are enabled by our people and technology.  

As a service company, Schlumberger has always worked closely with customers. We are exploring new ways to collaborate and help them overcome their challenges and improve performance. 

Operations integrity and efficiency—core to Schlumberger’s culture—are enhanced by the digitization of our operations. Just as Schlumberger is delivering digital solutions to our customers, we are advancing them in our own operations to capture value from our equipment and services businesses by integrating them into our digital structure. 

Capital stewardship is a crucial factor for our industry. Schlumberger has implemented a capital allocation framework that governs all investments, whether related to capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, or research and engineering. The underlying principle behind this framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow. Our focus on capital stewardship also includes evolving certain businesses into innovative, less capital-intensive commercial models. 

Go-to-Market 

Industry markets have evolved into multiple, diverse regional markets that are increasingly competing with each other to meet global, regional, and domestic oil and gas demand. Each of these regions has a set of resource plays—or basins—with localized economics and operational drivers. As a result, the industry is witnessing a decoupling of the activity characteristics of each major region, resulting in a unique set of dynamics for each oil and gas basin across the world. This presents Schlumberger with opportunities that can be optimally addressed with a basin-specific approach. 

5 

A key differentiator for Schlumberger is its “fit-for-basin” approach and ability. Fit-for-basin describes the mindset Schlumberger has adopted toward technology development, in-country value, and market access. Schlumberger is developing and deploying basin-specific technology that helps its customers overcome the challenges of their respective regions. At the same time, in-country value enables regional efficiency and performance, while creating opportunity and aligning with the strategic priorities of our clients.  

In addition, technology access and performance models are highly strategic elements of our go-to-market strategy. Technology access is fundamentally about making the right decisions with respect to our technology portfolio and how we go to market. Performance models are focused on commercial and contractual innovations.  

The elements of our go-to-market strategy enable Schlumberger to develop deeper partnerships with customers, expanding on their needs and challenges from a basin-specific perspective to provide technology and business models tailored to regional or individual customer requirements. These elements allow us to share in the performance improvement we deliver for customers and partners. 

Horizons of Growth 

The third strategic element positions Schlumberger to increase its share in existing markets and expand into new long-term markets in digital, production and recovery, and energy transition, including Schlumberger New Energy and Transition Technologies.  

Digital capabilities are crucial to long-term performance and resilience. Through its industry-leading digital platform, Schlumberger will enable digital transformation at scale, unlocking significant value, and leading innovation across the digital domain in the industry. 

Schlumberger seeks to define the future of digital technology in the energy industry and has designed and built a secure and flexible digital industry platform centered around differentiated digital technologies. Enabled by key partnerships with companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, AVEVA and NOV, Schlumberger provides an open digital platform that takes advantage of on-demand, high-performance computing and makes digital capabilities such as embedded artificial intelligence or machine learning readily accessible to customers.  

The application of digital technology across the entire E&P value chain—from subsurface to drilling to production—has the potential to deliver a step-change in operational workflows that will significantly elevate our customers’ performance sustainably. Digital technology can move technical workflows from the desktop to the cloud, creating data structures that enable artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide insights at scale across our customers’ operations.  

Production and recovery is about positioning Schlumberger to take advantage of two key trends shaping the market. The first trend relates to accelerating gas discovery, development and production, as Schlumberger expects to see significant growth in gas demand over the next two decades as the world seeks to decarbonize its energy mix. The second trend relates to operators’ increased focus on improving recovery from their existing wells, fields and infrastructure—ultimately achieving the most capital efficient production. As a result and based on our deep domain knowledge from the subsurface to midstream production facilities, we are positioning our technology portfolio to participate and lead in these growing markets. 

Finally, Schlumberger recognizes that its future will expand beyond oil and gas with energy transition, and the Company is positioning itself for long-term growth opportunities. In this regard, in 2020 the Company created Schlumberger New Energy to develop businesses in low-carbon or carbon-neutral energy technologies, and in 2021 it announced its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and launched its Transition Technologies portfolio to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations.  

Schlumberger New Energy is using partnership models and Schlumberger’s experience in technology industrialization to expand into energy verticals beyond oil and gas. Schlumberger’s approach is to apply its domain expertise in areas adjacent to its existing activities where it can use its global footprint and execution platform to deliver at scale. 

The Schlumberger New Energy portfolio consists of ventures in the domains of hydrogen, lithium, energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”), geothermal power and geoenergy for heating and cooling buildings. While many of these investments are in new energy emerging sectors, Schlumberger New Energy has leveraged Schlumberger’s extensive experience in both the CCS and geothermal sectors. For more than two decades, Schlumberger has participated in CCS projects providing consulting, technology services and project management. In geothermal, Schlumberger provides the full spectrum of geothermal resource development services through GeothermEx, a consulting and services company we acquired in 2010. Schlumberger New Energy has extended Schlumberger’s geothermal reach by exploring opportunities in the development of geothermal power projects.

•  

In CCS, Schlumberger New Energy is developing capabilities and forging partnerships to provide integrated solutions and technologies to CCS projects in selected markets and geographies where existing policies and regulations can make projects attractive. Schlumberger New Energy has partnered with Chevron, Microsoft and Clean Energy Systems to utilize biomass fuel that consumes CO2 over its lifetime to produce power and then safely and permanently sequestrates the produced CO2. This process results in net-negative carbon emissions, effectively removing greenhouse gas from the atmosphere.  

•  

Schlumberger invested in EnerVenue and entered into a collaboration agreement to deploy EnerVenue’s uniquely differentiated nickel-hydrogen battery technology, which is a key enabler of stationary energy storage solutions. Schlumberger New Energy and EnerVenue will work together to progress large-scale deployment of nickel-hydrogen battery technology across selected global markets. 

In June 2021, Schlumberger announced its commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050. Guided by climate science and GHG Protocol, Schlumberger spent 18 months conducting extensive analysis and working with experts to produce its decarbonization plan, which is aligned with the Paris Agreement ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Schlumberger was the first energy services company to set a net-zero target inclusive of all three emission scopes. By setting targets with respect to the Company’s total 2019 baseline GHG footprint of approximately 54 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent (which consisted of 52 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions and two million metric tons of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions), and not just its Scope 1 and 2 footprint, Schlumberger’s comprehensive emissions reduction roadmap addresses the entire oil and gas value chain.  

Schlumberger’s 2050 net zero target is supported by the following interim milestones, using 2019 as the baseline year: 

•  

by 2025, a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; 

•  

by 2030, a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions; and  

•  

by 2030, a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions. 

There are three key components to Schlumberger achieving its net-zero target: reducing operational emissions, reducing customer emissions that occur while using Schlumberger technology, and taking carbon-negative actions of sufficient scale to offset any residual operational and technology emissions that the Company may have in 2050.  

Schlumberger’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions primarily come from its fuel use and electricity consumption, whereas its Scope 3 emissions are indirect, such as customer emissions related to the use of Schlumberger technology and operational emissions related to purchased goods and services. In 2021, Schlumberger launched its Transition Technologies portfolio. This portfolio is focused on addressing fugitive emissions, flaring reduction, electrification, well construction emissions, and full field development solutions. Comprised of proprietary technologies and solutions, the Transition Technologies portfolio will help reduce direct and indirect emissions along with other environmental attributes, while simultaneously driving efficiency, reliability and performance for our customers.
