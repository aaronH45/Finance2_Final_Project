Seasonality 

The retail business is seasonal in nature with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in the months of November and December.

The Company has no material long-term purchase commitments with any of its suppliers and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company considers its relations with its suppliers to be good.

Competition 

The retail industry is highly competitive.

The Company seeks to attract customers by offering compelling, high-quality products, great prices and trusted service across all channels, including its digital platforms.

Human Capital Resources  

Culture & Engagement  

At Macy’s, culture is how the Company serves and supports its customers, communities and employees (called colleagues). The Company’s workplace is rooted in equity and guided by its values of acceptance, respect, integrity and giving back.  

The Company gathers colleague feedback at key times throughout the colleague lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding and provides regular venues for colleagues to ask questions and share their opinions, such as Ask Me Anything sessions, town halls and colleague resource groups. The Company formally solicits feedback from all colleagues twice a year through an enterprise-wide Culture Pulse Survey. The results are shared across the organization to provide visibility to both managers (called people leaders) and colleagues and help create an opportunity for open and constructive discussions among teams.  

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)  

Macy’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is guided by its values and starts from within by working to build a workforce that represents the communities it serves at all levels and making structural changes to implement practices and processes designed to be equitable and cultivate a culture of belonging. The Company seeks to empower colleagues to harness and unleash the power of their individuality to help drive better business decisions for customers and shareholders.  

The Company actively promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment for all customers and is also focused on supporting and developing underrepresented suppliers; investing in economic and workforce development; contributing to organizations fighting for social justice; and awarding scholarships to cultivate future leaders. 

One of the Company’s measures to advance the diversity of its leadership is the MOSAIC program, a one-year professional development program with continued support available as participants progress through their careers, launched in 2019 for its top talent at the manager and director levels who self-identify as ethnically diverse. From 2020 to 2021, approximately 74% of program participants were promoted or moved into a new role, with approximately 18% promoted to senior director level. The Company achieved 27.5% ethnic diversity representation at the director level and above, with a goal to reach 28.3% in 2022 and 30% by 2025. 

Macy’s believes people leaders play an important role in driving performance and an inclusive culture. In 2020, the Company incorporated People Leader Commitments (which were launched in 2019) and DE&I into the performance review process. In 2021, the Company included standardized DE&I goals into annual reviews at the director level and above. Starting in 2022, the Company has included the ethnic representation goal at the director level and above as part of annual incentive goals for the Company.  

Company-sponsored, employee-led resource groups (ERGs) provide an opportunity for colleagues to experience connection, achieve belonging and build community. In 2021, ERGs expanded beyond our corporate offices to all supply chain locations and 124 stores and continue to be a resource for attracting and retaining talent. We also launched the Interfaith ERG across Macy’s and Bloomingdales, based on colleague feedback that there is a need to incorporate dialogue and education about religion and non-religious beliefs in the workplace. 

Macy’s DE&I focus areas extend beyond its colleagues and include community, customers, marketing and suppliers. We have achieved a score of 100 every year since 2015 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equity Index, earning the designation as “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equity.” This index is the nation’s foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. In November 2021, Macy’s was recognized by the NBIC, a coalition of the nation’s leading business organizations representing diverse communities, as one of the Top 50 Best-of-the-Best Corporations for Inclusion. For example, here are a few highlights from the past year: 

•  

Two Macy’s colleagues continued their second year as fellows, solely dedicated to the work of CEO Action for Racial Equity Taskforce—the mission of the taskforce is to identify, develop and promote scalable and sustainable public policies and corporate engagement strategies that will address systemic racism, social justice and improve societal well-being.

•  

Added pronouns to colleague name badges and email signatures to foster a more inclusive environment for customers and colleagues.  

•  

Advanced diverse representation in advertising to reflect customers and expanded media to reach more ethnically diverse audiences.  

•  

Launched a new partnership with a strategic marketing and creative agency, JOY Collective, to integrate deeper cultural fluency across marketing activities including heritage and history month campaigns. 

•  

Celebrated a decade of The Workshop at Macy’s with expanded class size and month-long e-commerce activation. 

Learning & Development 

Macy’s believes that learning goes hand in hand with career growth, personal satisfaction and outstanding results. The Company aspires to create a learning culture where colleagues actively learn, apply what they have learned to address business challenges and share their knowledge, including their mistakes, to help others grow. Learning is accessible through Ignite (powered by Degreed), the Company’s self-directed learning experience platform as well as through technology, social learning and meaningful experiences and exposures with colleagues. We have also partnered with Guild, a leading education and upskilling platform, to provide “Fully Funded Education for Everyone,” including over 50 programs that lead to college degrees.  

The Company makes investments in its people leaders and future leaders. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s Executive Development Programs offer immersive, hands-on learning experiences for recent college graduates from top universities across the U.S. to jump start a career in retail, with specialization in technology, digital, stores, merchandising, and supply chain. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s offer internships for college students and Bloomingdale’s offers an early immersion program focused on providing experiential learning and career exposure to those who identify with underrepresented groups. Bluemercury’s Shooting Stars is a six-month mentorship program that empowers mentees to own their journey by creating a development plan, becoming an inclusive leader and leveraging resources to support their career aspirations. In 2019, Macy’s partnered with Parsons School of Design to launch Macy’s Fashion Academy – a custom executive education program designed to offer best-in-class development across all disciplines of its merchant talent. As a result of this partnership, we have been able to offer our Merchants custom experiences aligned with key pillars of our Polaris Strategy. 

People leaders participate annually in required leadership development training and have access to robust on-demand development resources. Professional colleagues participate in a 90-day onboarding experience with performance milestones, support resources and role-specific training 

Data Analytics 

During 2021, Macy’s continued to make progress in embedding data and analytics in Human Capital strategies and program measurements. Taking advantage of cloud-based HR technology has enabled real-time access to information and driven more colleague and people leader self-service.  

•  

Career & leadership development: Online learning platform enables the development of targeted learning driven by Company-desired skill sets and/or colleague-driven skill development   

•  

Culture: Through the analysis of culture surveys, the Company can gauge progress over time and identify areas where enhancements need to be introduced 

•  

Human resources: Leveraging technology to automate responses for common colleague questions related to pay and benefits 

•  

Talent recruitment and retention: Leveraging recruiting data from previous years enables the forecasting of talent needs and leads to more improved onboarding, leadership spans of control and marketing investments 

•  

Workplace structure: Through customer analysis, the Company has identified opportunities for sales growth, which in turn have led to the launch and build-out of specialized teams targeted on delivering these opportunities

Total Rewards 

Macy’s offers comprehensive benefits and an awards strategy that is designed to recognize performance and talent development. Eligible colleagues have varied medical plan options to meet individual needs. The Company provides paid time-off, parental leave and holiday pay as well as a company 401(k) plan and match, dependent care flexible spending account and a colleague merchandise discount for eligible colleagues. 

The Company believes that pay equity is fundamental to its culture and DE&I strategy. Compensation is based on job position, responsibilities, experience and performance with incentive opportunities that allow colleagues to share in the Company’s success.  

In 2021, the Company achieved greater than 99% pay equity across gender and race. In terms of both base pay and total compensation, the Company expects to pay female colleagues at greater than 99% of what it pays male colleagues, and it expects that minorities will be paid at greater than 99% of what it pays non-minorities in the U.S. 

In 2021, we continued our path to clear and competitive compensation programs by making the following investments: 

•  

Introduced long-term incentive opportunities for our director-level colleagues effective in 2022. 

•  

Provided our colleagues with access to view earned wages on a daily basis. 

•  

Committed to raising our hourly colleagues’ pay rate to $15/hour minimum nationwide in 2022. 

•  

Added a flexible paid holiday to support our colleagues’ well-being and provide further flexibility to take a day off on a holiday that is important to them. 

•  

Partnered with Guild to provide “Fully Funded Education for Everyone,” including over 50 programs that lead to college degrees.  

Number of Employees 

As of January 29, 2022, excluding seasonal employees, Macy’s had 88,857 full-time and part-time employees. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the number of employees peaks during the holiday season. Approximately 8% of employees are represented by unions.  

Sustainability  

Macy’s relationships with its customers, colleagues and the communities it serves drives a deep sense of stewardship in how the Company interacts with its stakeholders and underpins its commitment to promoting sustainability. The guiding principles of the Company’s sustainability strategy are:  

•  

Managing the environmental impact of its business 

•  

Promoting positive social impact, and  

•  

Continuing to ensure strong governance that holds Macy’s accountable.  

The Company proactively and continually engages with its stakeholders on sustainability issues that span the breadth of its operations. This includes transparency, product responsibility and supply chain and energy management. Macy’s is guided in its actions and reporting by its stakeholders and by third-party frameworks, including Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s multiline and specialty retailers and distributors standard and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. 

The Company continues to advance its sustainability strategy as it responds to evolving stakeholder expectations. Certain highlights of recent sustainability accomplishments include earning a B score on its 2021 CDP Climate Change Report and launching a sustainable products retail sitelet and Oake, a sustainable private brand textiles brand. 

The Company’s management is responsible for the development and implementation of its sustainability strategies and programs. Ultimate oversight by the Company’s Board of Directors is included in its committee charters and practices. The Chief Financial Officer along with the Disclosure Committee engages with stakeholders on sustainability and climate-related issues and provides feedback to management and the Board.
