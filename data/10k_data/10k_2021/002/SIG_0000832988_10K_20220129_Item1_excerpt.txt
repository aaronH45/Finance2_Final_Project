PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

PURPOSE & STRATEGY

Signet Jewelers Limited’s (“Signet”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) purpose is “Inspiring Love” and its mission is to enable all people to “Celebrate Life and Express Love.” The Company’s vision is to be the world’s premier jeweler by engaging customers with superior shopping and ownership experiences, connecting with them seamlessly across channels, earning their trust, and providing superior expertise, value, products, and services to meet their lifetime jewelry needs and desires. Signet is the innovation and market share leader of the jewelry category with opportunity for additional growth as the Company leverages its core strengths and competitive advantages.

In Fiscal 2022, Signet successfully completed a three-year transformation plan —“Path to Brilliance”— which was designed to position the Company for reliable, sustainable long-term growth. Having achieved or exceeded its Path to Brilliance goals, the Company launched its next phase of growth — “Inspiring Brilliance” — in Fiscal 2022, focused on four where-to-play strategies: Win in Big Businesses; Expand Accessible Luxury and Value; Accelerate Services; and Lead Digital Commerce. The core objectives of “Inspiring Brilliance” are to grow operating margin and gain market share while driving annual revenues toward its longer-term goal of $9 billion.

Inspiring Brilliance 

As described above, the foundations of “Inspiring Brilliance” are focused on four where-to-play strategies: Win in Big Businesses; Expand Accessible Luxury and Value; Accelerate Services; and Lead Digital Commerce. Below is the summary of the goals within these strategies, as well as the progress and accomplishments toward those goals during Fiscal 2022.

•Win in Big Businesses: Signet is investing in and keeping its largest businesses healthy and growing by differentiating and positioning Signet banners with the customers they serve best and by leading innovation that will help ensure they win. Signet’s banner value propositions are expanding the middle-market and attracting new and loyal customers across its entire portfolio. In this first year of Signet’s Inspiring Brilliance growth journey, the Company delivered revenue growth in each of its leading banners that is well ahead of the growth for the overall jewelry category. This early progress helped drive a 270 basis point gain to Signet’s market share, up from 6.6% in Fiscal 2021 to 9.3% in Fiscal 2022.

•Expand Accessible Luxury and Value: The Company is expanding the mid-market segment of the jewelry category by stretching the top of the mid-tier with greater focus on accessible luxury and the lower mid-tier with greater focus on value. At the top end of the market, Jared grew total revenue by 44% in Fiscal 2022, with its fastest growth reflected in products over $3,000. In addition, the Company acquired Diamonds Direct, an accessible luxury banner with a highly productive operating model. At the lower mid-tier, Signet’s goal of growing Banter by Piercing Pagoda (“Banter”) and outlets over time into billion-dollar businesses. Banter is on a growth trajectory with highly productive formats that delivered their seventh consecutive year of same store sales growth. Additionally, Banter opened a number of in-line formats, enabling banner access to shopping centers that do not allow Banter’s traditional kiosk format.

•Accelerate Services: Signet is positioned to create a $1 billion revenue stream through services, as well as expand its customer base and loyalty. Services carry higher margin profiles and Signet is focused on introducing consumer-driven services as well as enhancing its existing services. This past year, the Company strengthened its reputation as a preferred supplier of jewelry repair services with an enhanced and harmonized set of extended service agreements, increased repair customer satisfaction ratings, decreased repair times, and new services such as needle piercing and, through the acquisition of Rocksbox, jewelry rental. The Company also launched a loyalty program, Vault Rewards, that has already enrolled nearly 30,000 members since the pilot launched in November.

•Lead Digital Commerce: Digital innovation and capabilities are integral to the future of jewelry retail and is a cornerstone of Signet’s growth strategy. Signet now believes it has become the digital innovation leader in jewelry through focused investments and agile implementation. In Fiscal 2022, the Company implemented both customer-facing digital capabilities as well as operational technologies to strengthen its competitive advantages. Innovations included virtual try-on, asynchronous SMS texting between customers and jewelry consultants, and a range of flexible fulfillment options such as ship-from-store and same-day delivery. In the past year, roughly 25% of online orders utilized one of Signet’s flexible fulfillment capabilities, which contributed to more than a 50% improvement in inventory turn. In addition, the Company is leveraging artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning in many operational parts of its business such as inventory distribution, labor planning and real estate fleet optimization. For example, since starting its transformation four years ago, Signet has reduced its store fleet by roughly 20%, using data-driven insights, in order to deliver nearly 500 basis points of annual gross margin

expansion. Further, the Company is enabling its team members to be social ambassadors. More than 2,500 team members, including 700 virtual jewelry consultants, have been trained as micro-influencers.

How to Win: The Company is executing these growth strategies with three “How to Win” priorities: a Consumer-Inspired mindset, Connected Commerce presence, and a Culture of Innovation and Agility.

•Consumer Inspired: The Company is growing its customer base by drawing inspiration from inside and outside the jewelry category to drive innovation. Signet’s ability to develop unique customer insights with highly precise data analytics is emerging as a clear and sustainable competitive advantage. For example, in Fiscal 2022, Signet identified a trend in consumer spending as customers began spending more on gifts for those closest to them. Through careful assortment and price architecture planning, the Company took advantage of this emerging trend to drive higher average transaction values across all its banners. This data-powered foresight allowed the Company to be staffed and stocked in a year in which supply chain issues were significant obstacles for many retailers, leading Signet to deliver the strongest holiday selling season in its history.

•Connected Commerce: As part of its Path to Brilliance transformation, Signet moved from a bricks-and-mortar-centric business model to an OmniChannel strategy. Now, through Inspiring Brilliance, the Company is positioning itself to win with connected commerce capabilities that transcend OmniChannel, enabling its banners to engage customers whenever, wherever and however they want to shop. No other jewelry retailer offers a comparable mix of stores and digital platforms to serve customers. In Fiscal 2022, nearly 20% of sales were completed online and 65% of customers reported that they used a banner website prior to completing their purchase, which indicates that Signet customers now use both online and in-store experiences as part of their shopping journey. These seamless, friction-free experiences lead to higher transaction values and stronger conversion rates than a traditional OmniChannel strategy.

•Culture of Innovation and Agility: Signet has transformed its culture – achieving two consecutive years of being named a Great Place to Work-Certified™ Company. The Signet team is operating with high engagement scores and enhanced productivity levels. In fact, 90% of team members surveyed via the Great Place To Work® Trust Index© Employee Survey responded, “When I look at what we accomplish, I feel a sense of pride.” With the most experienced and dedicated team in its category, Signet is committed to be the innovation leader of every business in which it competes and to operate with the agility required to learn, grow and lead. The Company will continue to encourage leadership and fast-paced iterative learning at every level, to empower agile work teams, to inspire Design Thinking approaches to problem solving, and to nurture an environment in which innovation, diversity and transformational productivity are signature characteristics of the Signet culture. The strength of Signet’s culture has become a competitive advantage as it attracts top talent, enables high retention and low attrition rates, and inspires peak performance at every level of the organization, all of which are reflected in the Company’s strong business performance.

With its Path to Brilliance transformation now complete - and industry-leading growth in the first year of its Inspiring Brilliance growth journey - Signet is demonstrating that it has the strategies, strengths and talent to consistently outpace the market and deliver reliable, long-term sustainable growth.

2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals 

As a company with a Citizenship & Sustainability Committee focused on its Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) strategy, and a purpose-inspired business strategy in Inspiring Brilliance described above, Signet is committed to ongoing leadership in ESG initiatives as an important growth driver that is critical to the health of our business. To that end, the Company released its 2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals in Fiscal 2022, further strengthening Signet’s Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability leadership in the industry. Having already established its open-sourced Signet Responsible Sourcing Protocol which has become the industry standard for ethical and responsible sourcing, the Company now is committed to be the jewelry category leader in supply chain due diligence and reporting.

The Company’s Corporate Sustainability Goals are aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals in areas where Signet can have the most impact. Signet is a member of the UN Global Compact and adheres to its principles-based approach to responsible business. Leaders throughout the Company are engaged in every aspect of the Company’s Sustainability efforts. Banner leaders as well as functional leaders in Corporate Communications, Finance, Human Resources, Supply Chain, IT and Merchandising are responsible for achieving short-term and long-term goals. The Company has already achieved three of its Corporate Sustainability Goals while continuing to make steady progress towards its remaining goals.

The Company also launched the Signet Love Inspires Foundation (“Foundation”) to partner with and give grants to 501(c)(3) organizations that support underserved women and children, and social change advocacy, with the goal of creating a more equitable and sustainable world. With a focus on underserved woman and children the Foundation is able to support people during crisis with humanitarian aid.

OVERVIEW

Signet is the world’s largest retailer of diamond jewelry. Signet is incorporated in Bermuda and its address and telephone number are shown on the cover of this document. The Company operated 2,854 stores and kiosks as of January 29, 2022, which when combined with the Company’s digital capabilities under its Connected Commerce strategy, provides customers the opportunity to use both online and in-store experiences as part of their shopping journey. Signet manages its business by geography, a description of which follows:

•The North America segment operated 2,506 locations in the US and 94 locations in Canada as of January 29, 2022. 

◦In the US, the segment primarily operated in malls and off-mall locations under the following banners: Kay (Kay Jewelers and Kay Outlet); Zales (Zales Jewelers and Zales Outlet); Jared (Jared The Galleria Of Jewelry and Jared Vault); Diamonds Direct; JamesAllen.com; and Rocksbox. Additionally, in the US, the segment operated mall-based kiosks under the Banter by Piercing Pagoda banner.

◦In Canada, the segment primarily operated under the Peoples banner (Peoples Jewellers).

•The International segment operated 348 stores in the UK, Republic of Ireland and Channel Islands as of January 29, 2022, all under the H. Samuel and Ernest Jones banners.

Certain Company activities are managed in the “Other” segment for financial reporting purposes, including the Company’s diamond sourcing function and its diamond polishing factory in Botswana. See Note 5 of Item 8 for additional information regarding the Company’s reportable segments.

Competition and Signet Competitive Strengths

Jewelry retailing is highly fragmented and competitive. Signet competes against other specialty jewelers, as well as other retailers that sell jewelry, including department stores, mass merchandisers, discount stores, apparel and accessory fashion stores, brand retailers, online retail and auction sites, shopping clubs, home shopping television channels and direct home sellers. The jewelry category competes for customers’ share-of-wallet with other consumer sectors such as electronics, clothing and furniture, as well as travel and restaurants. This competition for consumers’ discretionary spending is particularly relevant to gift giving.

In addition to the core strengths noted above, Signet believes its competitive advantages include strong awareness for each banner, superior customer experience, branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise, data-driven marketing and advertising, diversified real estate portfolio, an efficient and flexible supply chain, and services including financing and lease purchase options, extended service plans, repair and customer design, and piercing, among others.

Connected commerce

As a specialty jeweler, Signet’s business differs from many other retailers such that a purchase of merchandise from any of Signet’s stores is not only viewed as an important experience but is also personal and intimate. Due to this dynamic, customers often invest time on Signet websites, through conversational commerce and on social media to experience the merchandise assortments prior to visiting brick-and-mortar stores to execute a purchase transaction. Particularly related to high value transactions, customers will supplement their online experience with an in-store visit prior to finalizing a purchase.

Through Signet’s banner websites, the Company educates customers about the jewelry category, and provides them with a source of information on products, brands, and available merchandise, as well as the ability to buy online. To effectively service the ever-evolving needs of its digitally connected customers, Signet’s websites are integrated with a customer’s local store, so that merchandise ordered online may be delivered to their store or at home. Banner websites continue to make an important and growing contribution to the customer experience, as well as to each banner’s marketing programs. Signet’s Connected Commerce strategy will continue to focus on:

•Investments in technologies and digital capabilities to enhance the customer journey. These include developing AI driven conversational commerce, the ability to virtually try on products, visual search tools, configuration capability, jewelry related services enhanced personalization / behavioral targeting, creative execution and brand differentiation. In addition, Signet will continue to focus on customer-first delivery options (such as buy online, pick up in store, “BOPIS”, same day delivery, curbside pickup, ship from store), creating a seamless customer experience between the websites, virtual and in-store selling, making it easier for customers whenever and however they choose to shop with Signet.

•The expansion of asynchronous messaging with intent recognition and the ability to route to the appropriate expert based on that intent recognition whether that be a sales expert for engagement rings, watches or other gifts, or service to an existing order or purchase.

7
•The creation of a robust Customer Data Platform and Journey Analytics and Orchestration program to achieve a more comprehensive and personalized view of the customer, and also facilitate cookie-less data activation which is expected to allow the Company to follow up on previous purchases as well as anticipate their needs.

•Adding new capabilities to Signet’s digital customer clientele program, which enables the Company’s jewelry consultants to build a direct relationship with their customers to create a more personalized customer experience. In Fiscal 2022, this program was further enhanced with a newly created Digital In-Store Integration practice established to lead the integration of Digital into brick & mortar stores across Signet banners. This team partners closely with IT and Operations to harmonize and enhance existing applications and systems and use next generation training techniques to provide the right level of training and support to the field team.

Signet’s supplier relationships allow the Company to display suppliers’ inventories on the banner websites for sale to customers without holding the items in its inventory until the products are ordered by customers, which are referred to as “virtual inventory.” Virtual inventory expands the choice of merchandise available to customers both online and in-store and accounted for approximately 8% of North America sales and 49% of North America online sales in Fiscal 2022 (see further in the Products and merchandising section below).

Customer experience

Signet is committed to delivering an inspiring, innovative, full service, seamlessly connected customer experience for our clients regardless of their channel of choice. The Company considers this an essential element and competitive advantage in the success of its business. The ability to recruit, develop and retain qualified jewelry consultants is an important capability to deliver customer satisfaction. Signet has comprehensive recruitment, training and incentive programs in place, including annual training conferences in the spring and fall.

Signet continues to invest in capabilities to enhance the customer experience to make it more personalized and journey focused. In Fiscal 2019, Signet implemented a multi-phase Voice of the Customer program utilizing the Net Promoter System as a component of its Path to Brilliance transformation plan and customer first initiatives. The first phase focused on setting up the technology, establishing stable measurements throughout the shopping ecosystem for key customer journeys, and discovering how to effectively operationalize customer feedback. In Fiscal 2020, Signet expanded into phase two by providing all stores and digital properties localized access to Voice of the Customer data to manage the customer experience real-time as performance feedback is received. To further strengthen its engagement with customers, Signet also implemented a closed-loop program whereby field and customer care teams rapidly respond to customers directly about their feedback to ensure the Company is delivering the best possible experience. In Fiscal 2021, Signet continued to optimize the program through expanded measurements and listening posts, integrating Voice of the Customer with additional operational data sources to drive greater sophistication in its customer and employee experience management, and develop additional tools to infuse the stories its customers share into the culture and their daily activities. Further refinements were pursued in Fiscal 2022 to continue to equip jewelry consultants, digital, and banner personnel with robust customer feedback to enhance their customer offerings and experiences.

Banner operations

As noted above, the Company operates eight banners in North America and two banners in the UK, with the majority operating through both online and brick and mortar retail operations. Signet has specific operating and financial criteria that must be satisfied before investing in new stores or renewing leases on existing stores, including evaluation of the mall/trade area and market potential. The Company reduced its store fleet by roughly 20% since beginning its transformation in Fiscal 2019, driving nearly 500 basis points of gross margin leverage over that time. Substantially all of the stores operated by Signet are leased. Signet continues to reposition its store portfolio in a manner that it believes will drive greater store productivity. These efforts include development and implementation of innovative store concepts to improve the in-store shopping experience, execution of opportunistic store relocations and store closures aimed at exiting under-performing stores, reducing the Company’s mall-based exposure and exiting regional brands.

The store activity was as follows for Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021:

Ernest Jones accounted for 3% of Signet’s consolidated sales in Fiscal 2022 (Fiscal 2021: 4%).

Products and merchandising 

Signet believes that a competitive strength is its industry-leading merchandising. Merchandise selection, innovation, availability and value are all critical success factors. The range of merchandise offered and the appropriate level of inventory availability are supported centrally by extensive and continuous research and testing. Signet’s jewelry merchant teams are constantly evaluating global design trends, innovating, and developing new jewelry collections, including through strategic partnerships, that resonate with customers.

Suppliers

In Fiscal 2022, the five largest suppliers collectively accounted for approximately 19.6% of total purchases, with the largest supplier comprising 5.1%. Signet transacts business with suppliers on a worldwide basis at various stages of the supply chain with third party diamond cutting and jewelry manufacturing being predominantly carried out in Asia.

Merchandise

Details of merchandise mix by major product category (excluding repairs, extended service plans and other miscellaneous sales) are shown below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The bridal category, which includes engagement, wedding and anniversary purchases, is predominantly diamond jewelry. All of our product categories are to an extent dependent on the economic environment as customers can trade up or down price points depending on their available budget. Bridal represented 47% of Signet’s total merchandise sales and the fashion category represents 46% of Signet’s total merchandise sales during Fiscal 2022.

Merchandise is categorized as non-branded, third party branded, and branded differentiated and exclusive. Non-branded merchandise includes items and styles such as bracelets, gold necklaces, solitaire diamond rings, and diamond stud earrings. Branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise are items that are branded and exclusive to Signet within its marketplaces, or that are not widely available from other jewelry retailers (e.g. Vera Wang Love®, Neil Lane®, Disney Enchanted®).

Signet believes that the development of branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise raises the profile of its banners, helps to drive sales and provides its well-trained jewelry consultants with a powerful selling proposition. Digital marketing and national television advertisements include elements that drive brand awareness and purchase intent. Signet’s scale and proven record of success in developing branded differentiated and exclusive merchandise attracts offers of such programs from jewelry manufacturers, designers and others ahead of competing retailers, and enables it to leverage its supply chain strengths.

Merchandise held on consignment is used to enhance product selection and test new designs. This minimizes exposure to changes in fashion trends and provides the flexibility to return non-performing merchandise. Virtually all of Signet’s consignment inventory is held in the US.

11
Raw materials 

The Company’s costs, as with the jewelry industry as a whole, are generally affected by fluctuations in the price and supply of diamonds, gold and, to a much lesser extent, other precious and semi-precious metals and stones. The cost of raw materials is only part of the costs involved in determining the retail selling price of jewelry, with labor costs and assembly costs from third-party vendors also being significant factors.

Diamond sourcing

Signet procures its diamonds mostly as finished jewelry and, to a smaller extent, as loose polished diamonds and rough diamonds which are in turn polished, primarily in Signet’s Botswana factory. 

Signet purchases finished product where management has identified compelling value based on product design, cost and availability, among other factors. Under certain types of arrangements, this method of purchasing also provides the Company with the opportunity to reserve inventory held by vendors and to make returns or exchanges with suppliers, which reduces the risk of over- or under-purchasing. Signet’s scale, balance sheet and robust procurement systems enable it to purchase merchandise at advantageous prices and on favorable terms.

Signet purchases loose polished diamonds in global markets (e.g. India, Israel) from a variety of sources (e.g. polishers, traders). Signet mounts stones in settings purchased from manufacturers using third-parties and in-house resources. By using these approaches, the cost of merchandise is reduced and the consistency of quality is maintained enabling Signet to provide better value to customers. Buying loose diamonds helps allow Signet’s buyers to gain a detailed understanding of the manufacturing cost structures and, in turn, leverage that knowledge to negotiating better prices for the supply of finished products.

Signet continues to take steps to advance its vertical integration, which includes rough diamond sourcing and processing. Signet’s objective with this initiative is to secure additional, reliable and consistent supplies of diamonds for customers worldwide while achieving further efficiencies in the supply chain. Signet owns a diamond polishing factory in Gaborone, Botswana. The Company is a DeBeers sightholder, and receives contracted allocations of rough diamonds. Signet has also established a diamond liaison office in India and a diamond trading office in New York to further support its sourcing initiative.

Rough diamonds are purchased directly from the miners and then the stones are marked, cut and polished in Signet’s own polishing facility. Any stones deemed unsuitable for Signet’s needs are sold to third-parties on the open market.

Marketing and advertising

Marketing is one of Signet’s most critical investments. It generates customer awareness and purchase considerations, and over time strengthens its banners and drives share growth. Effective and efficient marketing investment is a competitive advantage in the jewelry industry, which involves a discretionary purchase where most of the merchandise is not branded, and the purchase cycle can stretch to years.

Signet’s marketing investment is allocated between the various options available (broadcast television, online video, connected television, programmatic radio, direct mail, digital marketing, social media, and in store materials), and the spend distribution evolves over time to align to change in consumer behavior.

As marketing activities are undertaken throughout the year, digital and data capabilities provide real-time insights into customer journeys, enabling personalized communications. Signet will continue to evolve its marketing model by re-balancing the timing and mix of its media investments, leveraging a more personalized journey-based approach, and modernizing its content and messaging in order to improve effectiveness and better align to shifts in consumer media consumption. Additionally, while the Company will maintain its strong presence during traditional time-based holidays (Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, and the Holiday Season), Signet will also expand capabilities to grow its share of personal gifting occasions such as birthdays and anniversaries, and continue its emphasis in “always on” bridal messaging.

Signet will continue to optimize the effectiveness of its creative campaigns, building on banner differentiation strategies. The banners work with a portfolio of creative agencies and have built both internal and external data and media expertise.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other sales and services

The Company offers repair services to its customers that include both merchandise repairs and custom design services. These services represent less than 5% of consolidated sales; however, represent an important opportunity to build customer loyalty. The custom design and repair business has its own field management and training structure, and operates in Design & Service Centers located in Jared stores. These Design & Service Centers are staffed with skilled artisans who support the repair and custom business generated across all US banners. Signet’s custom jewelry sales use a proprietary computer selling system and in-store design capabilities.

The North America segment sells extended service plans covering lifetime repair service for jewelry and jewelry replacement plans. The Design & Service Centers also service the lifetime repair service plans for Kay, Zales and Jared, in addition to supporting the chargeable repairs and custom businesses. The lifetime repair service plans cover services such as ring sizing, refinishing and polishing, rhodium plating of white gold, earring repair, chain soldering and the resetting of diamonds and gemstones that arise due to the normal usage of the merchandise or a replacement option if the merchandise cannot be repaired. The extended service plans are a valuable part of the customer experience and product offerings. These plans provide the Company a higher rate of profitability than merchandise sales and are a significant component of Signet’s operating income. In Fiscal 2022, we introduced updated extended service agreements offering unique plans for both bridal and fashion merchandise, with additional benefits including engraving for bridal merchandise. Jewelry replacement plans require the issuance of new replacement merchandise if the original merchandise is determined to be defective or damaged within a defined period in accordance with the plan agreement. The North America segment also offers customers a two-year fine watch warranty. Refer to Note 3 in Item 8 for further information on these plans.

Customer finance

Several factors inherent in the US jewelry business support the circumstances through which Signet is positioned to generate profitable incremental business through its partner supported consumer payment programs. These factors include a high average transaction value and a significant population of customers seeking to finance merchandise, primarily in the bridal category. Signet’s financial service offerings are an integral part of its business and a major driver of customer loyalty. In North American markets, customers are offered revolving and promotional credit plans under Signet’s private label credit card programs, online payment options, a lease purchase option provided by Progressive Lease, and installment loan and split-payment options provided by Affirm, allowing Signet to offer payment options that meet each customer’s individual needs. In addition, the Company has partnerships with third-party providers who directly extend credit to its customers, and who also manage and service the customers’ accounts.

Below is a summary of the payment participation rate in North America which reflects activity for in-house and outsourced credit program customers in North America, for Kay, Jared, Zales and Banter customers, as well as lease purchase customers:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes Diamonds Direct, James Allen, and Rocksbox, as these banners do not participate in the Company’s financing programs discussed above.

Through Signet’s partnerships, the Company is able to offer a range of financing, leasing, and payment opportunities across its banners. The Company continues to find and develop new options to meet its customer’s needs across the various merchandise price points. These offerings and partnerships allow the Company to focus on its core business of being the premier jewelry partner for its customers.

Comenity Bank provides credit and services to the Kay, Jared, Zales and Banter banners. Genesis Financial Solutions (“Genesis”) provides a second look program for applicants declined by Comenity Bank. During Fiscal 2022, the Comenity and Genesis program agreements were amended and restated to terminate in December 2025. Additionally, in Fiscal 2022 Signet entered into amended and restated purchase agreements with Carval, Castlelake, and Genesis (“Investors”) regarding the purchase of add-on receivables on such Investors’ existing accounts, as well as the purchase of the Signet-owned credit card receivables portfolio for accounts that had been originated through Fiscal 2021. Servicing of these non-prime add-on receivables, including operational interfaces and customer

servicing, is provided by Genesis. As a result of the amended and restated agreements entered into with Comenity, Genesis, and the Investors during Fiscal 2022, Signet no longer retains any customer in-house finance receivables. In addition, on March 7, 2022, the Company entered into amended and restated receivable purchase agreements with CarVal and Castlelake regarding the purchase of add-on receivables on such Investors’ existing accounts. Under the amended and restated agreements, The Bank of Missouri will be the issuer for the add-on receivables on these existing accounts and CarVal and Castlelake will purchase the receivables from The Bank of Missouri. 

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

Signet’s People First approach

At Signet, our approach to Human Capital management starts with our core value of “People First” and creating a truly inclusive, innovative, and collaborative company culture. We believe that thriving and engaged team members are integral to Signet’s success. The execution of our Inspiring Brilliance business strategy is supported by our confidence in the Signet team and our commitment to their overall success and personal growth. As a retail company, sales and customer relationships are at the core of our business model. Our success depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain highly engaged and motivated team members. Our emphasis on rewarding our retail team members with competitive wages and benefits provides a compelling package. We invested significantly in the wages and overall compensation of our existing team members in the fall of Fiscal 2022 by raising the minimum wage to $15/hour for our US operations. For eligible jewelry consultants in the US, our total average hourly wage is $20.55.

In Fiscal 2022, Signet was again named a Great Place to Work-Certified™ Company for the second consecutive year which reflects the pride, engagement, and enthusiasm of our employees throughout our organization. We are proud and honored by this recognition and we attribute this accolade to our focus on transforming the Company’s culture, team member engagement and our overall human capital management strategy. In addition, Signet was named to the Bloomberg® Gender Equality Index for the fourth year in a row – the only specialty retail jeweler to do so. Signet was rated 85 out of 100 by the Human Rights Coalition Corporate Equality Index.

Vision for the Future

As noted in the Purpose and Strategy section, the Company released its 2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals in Fiscal 2022. The Company’s goals provide a roadmap for Signet’s commitment to sustainability. Under the heading “Love for Our Team,” The Chief People Officer is responsible for fifteen goals in the areas of Employer of Choice, Community of Inclusiveness, and Purpose and Appreciation. A full list of Signet’s goals is published on the Company’s corporate website and an annual progress report on the goals is included in the Company’s annual Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability report.

Employees and demographics

As of January 29, 2022, the number of global team members employed at Signet was 30,856 as compared to 26,749 at January 30, 2021. Approximately 88% of the Company’s workforce was employed in North America.

Diversity, equity, and inclusion 

We value building a diverse workforce, embracing different perspectives, and fostering an inclusive, empowering work environment for our team members and customers. Our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts transcend all levels of our Company, from our retail store team members through our leadership team and Board of Directors (“Board”). Currently, 58 percent of our Board are gender or ethnically diverse, including five female Board members and two ethnically diverse Board members. Approximately 42 percent of Vice Presidents and above are women and approximately 13 percent of Vice Presidents and above are ethnically diverse.

In response to the Fiscal 2022 Great Place to Work®Trust Index© Employee Survey, Signet team members responded positively to statements regarding fair treatment in our Company. Of team members surveyed, 91 percent of Signet team members responded, "People here are treated fairly regardless of race” and 93 percent of Signet team members responded, “People here are treated fairly regardless of sexual orientation.” Furthermore, we recognize our customer base's diversity and strive to have a workforce that is representative of such customers. In Fiscal 2022, approximately 69 percent of Signet’s new hires in North America were diverse candidates.

We are committed to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the workplace. In Fiscal 2022, we provided team members the opportunity to select a third nonbinary option in addition to male and female in our HRIS software. This innovation invited team members to bring their whole selves to work. We expanded our thriving Business Resource Groups (“BRGs”), which are team member led volunteer groups to improve attraction, retention, inclusion, and engagement of a diverse workforce by developing programming and initiatives. We added two additional BRGs and, currently, we have eight: Veterans, Pride (LGBTQ+), Women, Black Employee Network, Young Professionals, Transforming Diversity Equity and Equality (“TIDE”), Diamante (Hispanic and Latinx) and Asian Pacific Employee Network. In addition, during Fiscal 2022 we continued a series of “Signet Speaks Out” town halls providing a safe, open forum for team members to have honest and candid discussions about important topics such as racism, allyship and inclusion. In addition, as part of our commitment to continued enhancements in our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, we require team members to undergo annual training on unconscious bias and microaggressions.

Training

In Fiscal 2022, Signet launched Brilliant University, a new platform for investing in team member training, leadership development and education. The platform gives team members access to training modules from their very first day of employment. Investments in our people, such as training, allows us to recruit exceptional candidates from other retailers and industries and efficiently provide them with new skills and experiences regarding Signet values, leadership traits and jewelry knowledge.

Brilliant University empowers team members to invest in learning their job, building new skills and growing their career. The Signet team member training experience is defined by Signet’s seven leadership traits (1) Vision and purpose (2) Critical thinking (3) 

15
Customer obsession (4) Employee Experience (5) Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (6) Innovative Action and (7) Performance Excellence. Our leadership traits are foundational to the success of each leader at Signet no matter the job title. We believe in “leadership at every level” and Brilliant University provides education and training for team members to learn more about what each trait looks like at different levels in the organization.

Board oversight

Signet’s Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee plays an active role in overseeing our human capital management efforts. The full Board has worked closely with the executive management team, particularly the Chief People Officer, in helping shape the succession plans and leadership development agenda. Board oversight activities in this area include review of CEO and executive officer succession planning, review of diversity and other employee metrics, employee experience, and review of the Company's annual employee engagement survey results. In addition to its compensation governance responsibilities, the Committee provides oversight on behalf of the Board to overall management of human capital including culture, diversity and inclusion, executive compensation programs, benefits and well-being strategy, talent management (attraction, development, and retention), performance management, and succession planning. The scope of this Committee underscores our focus on the quality, performance, retention and development of our team. Signet’s Human Capital Management and Compensation Committee, in collaboration with the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability Committee, oversees diversity, equity and inclusion, employee engagement and employee experience practices, and Signet’s Love for Our Team Corporate Sustainability Goals. The Board supported the introduction of our newly defined employee experience where team members are: invited to be their best selves; introduced to new ideas that grow their passion, not just their jobs; and are inspired to inspire more love in the world.

Compensation and benefits 

One of our primary retention strategies is focused on providing competitive wages as part of the overall team member experience. This fundamental approach to human capital management is intended to attract and retain a talented and diverse workforce, who provide significant value to our customers, Company, and stakeholders. We fully implemented our $15/hour minimum wage for our existing US operations in the fall of Fiscal 2022 ahead of schedule and ahead of our holiday recruiting. In addition, we announced holiday bonuses for all retail team members ahead of the holiday recruiting season. This strategy allowed us to attract and hire seasonal team members and meet all of our holiday sales goals.

Competitive benefits are critical to our success in identifying, recruiting, retaining, and incentivizing our existing and prospective team members. 

•We design our benefit packages to be competitive in the marketplace and they meet or exceed local laws. Full-time hourly team members are eligible for health insurance, parental leave, paid time off, and tuition assistance.

•We provide our team members with access to flexible and convenient medical benefits programs intended to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer eligible team members dental and vision coverage, health savings, flexible spending accounts, paid time off, employee assistance programs, voluntary short-term and long-term disability insurance, term life insurance and a 401(k) Savings Plan in the US. 

•Signet provides health plan benefits for same-sex domestic partners/spouses and LGBTQ team members. Health insurance and parental leave benefits include same-sex partners, and health insurance benefits include fertility coverage and adoption benefits for LGBTQ families. All parents, regardless of gender, are eligible for parental leave benefits. Transgender benefits were announced in Fiscal 2021 and were fully implemented in Fiscal 2022.

•Signet has not raised employee premiums on medical benefits for two years in a row.

Communications and employee sentiment

Communication efforts are one of our key strategies to engage, educate and unite our team members. Signet launched its “Inspiring Love” corporate purpose in Fiscal 2021, followed by the launch of the Team Member Experience in Fiscal 2022.

In Fiscal 2022, the Company integrated Purpose-driven messaging into the employee experience and brought purpose to life through all of our actions. The Signet Team Member Experience provides timely, relevant and consistent messaging and engages our team in common growth objectives to support the success of the organization. The Team Member Experience unifies the Company as a whole, creates a unique value proposition, allows us to differentiate ourselves as a retailer and as an employer of choice. In the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2022, Signet launched a Voice of the Employee survey. The survey results reflected a renewed and clear sense of Purpose with nearly 90% of team members understanding how their work contributes to Signet's Purpose. Throughout the year employee engagement scores steadily increased resulting in an increase of Signet’s annual retention rate of seven percentage points from Fiscal 2021 to Fiscal 2022.

Collective bargaining

We respect our employees' rights to organize and engage in bargaining in good faith to reach a collective agreement that meets team members’ needs. Our diamond polishing factory employees in Gaborone, Botswana are covered by a collective bargaining agreement (represents less than 1% of Signet’s total employees). None of our employees in the UK and North America are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

MARKETS

Signet operates in the US, Canada and UK markets.

US

Based on the average of the most recent market estimates published by Euromonitor in July 2021, Mintel in September 2021, and Statista in October 2021, the total US jewelry and watch market was approximately $69 billion in 2021. This implies a Signet jewelry and watch market share of 9.3%. Since 2010, the industry average annual growth rate is 2%. Around 90% of the market is represented by jewelry, with the balance being attributable to watches. According to the latest data from the US Labor Department, as of September 2021 there were approximately 19,100 jewelry stores in the country, down 1% from the prior year.

Canada

Prior to 2020, the jewelry and watch market in Canada, according to the latest data available to Signet from Euromonitor, grew steadily since 2014, rising to an estimated $6.8 billion USD in 2019. However, COVID-19 impacted growth in 2020 and the market is still recovering, reaching a Euromonitor estimated market size of $6.4 billion USD in 2021, an increase of 12% from the previous year. From 2022 through 2026, Euromonitor predicts jewelry will record a 7% current value compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) (a 4% value CAGR at constant 2021 prices).

UK

In the UK, the jewelry and watch market was estimated at about £7.2 billion in 2021, up approximately 16% from the prior year, according to Euromonitor.

REGULATION

As a company with both US and international operations, we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, covering areas such as consumer protection, consumer privacy, data protection, consumer credit, consumer credit insurance, health and safety, waste disposal, supply chain integrity, truth in advertising and employment. Signet monitors changes in these laws to maintain compliance with applicable requirements.

17
CLIMATE CHANGE

Signet recognizes that climate change poses a systemic risk to business operations.

Adverse effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events, particularly over a prolonged period of time, could negatively impact the Company’s business and results of operations if such conditions limit our consumers ability to access our stores, cause our consumers to limit discretionary spending, or disrupt our supply chains or distribution channels.

Adverse effects of climate change may increase the costs of diamond mining and diamond processing including cutting and polishing. Signet sources diamonds from around the world, and some locations may be more vulnerable to climate change. If the costs of natural diamonds increase, Signet may reallocate sourcing to lab-grown diamonds in line with customer preferences for cost and quality.

In Fiscal 2022, Signet took the first steps required to prepare the Company for disclosure in line with Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures (“TCFD”). Signet has put a governance structure in place to monitor climate-change risks and adjust business operations accordingly. Two Board level committees at Signet are responsible for monitoring climate change risks (1) the Audit Committee supervises risks across the Company, and (2) the Corporate Citizenship and Sustainability Committee supervises enterprise-wide policy regarding Signet’s 2030 Corporate Sustainability Goals, including Signet’s goal to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. At the Company level, Signet formed the Climate Action and Sustainability Committee (“CASC”) in June 2021. CASC is a cross-functional committee with leaders across Signet’s business operations with the mandate of improving Signet’s data disclosures on climate and monitoring the progress of Signet’s climate-related Corporate Sustainability Goals. Signet’s greenhouse gas emission data is published in our annual Sustainability report, which is available on the Company’s website. Signet is also in the process of instituting the policies and procedures required to disclose financial grade greenhouse gas emissions data.
