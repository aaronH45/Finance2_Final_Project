Customers

As an industry leader, we have established close working relationships with many of our customers. These relationships allow us to better anticipate and respond to customer needs when designing new products and new technical solutions. By working with our customers in developing new products and technologies, we believe we can identify and act on trends and leverage knowledge about next-generation technology across our products.

Our approach to our customers is driven by our dedication to further develop our product families and ensure that we are globally positioned to best provide our customers with sales and engineering support. We believe that as electronic component technologies continue to proliferate, our broad product portfolio and engineering capability give us a potential competitive advantage when addressing the needs of our global customers.

We manufacture and sell a broad portfolio of products to customers in various industries. Our customers include many of the leaders in their respective industries, and our relationships with them typically date back many years. We believe that our diversified customer base provides us an opportunity to leverage our skills and experience across markets and reduce our exposure to individual end markets, thereby reducing the variability of our financial performance. Additionally, we believe that the diversity of our customer base reduces the level of cyclicality in our results and distinguishes us from our competitors.

No single customer accounted for a significant amount of our net sales in fiscal 2022, 2021, or 2020.

Sales and Distribution

We maintain a strong local presence in each of the geographic regions in which we operate. Our net sales by geographic region(1) as a percentage of our total net sales were as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)

Net sales to external customers are attributed to individual countries based on the legal entity that records the sale.

We sell our products into approximately 140 countries primarily through direct selling efforts to manufacturers. In fiscal 2022, our direct sales represented approximately 75% of total net sales. We also sell our products indirectly via third-party distributors.

We maintain distribution centers around the world. Products are generally delivered to the distribution centers by our manufacturing facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, however, products are delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to the customer. Our global coverage positions us near our customers’ locations and allows us to assist them in consolidating their supply base and lowering their production costs. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products globally via road, rail, sea, and air. We believe our balanced sales distribution lowers our exposure to any particular geography and improves our financial profile.

Seasonality and Backlog

Typically, we experience a slight seasonal pattern to our business. Overall, the third and fourth fiscal quarters are usually the strongest quarters of our fiscal year, whereas the first fiscal quarter is negatively affected by holidays and the second fiscal quarter may be affected by adverse winter weather conditions in some of our markets.

Certain of our end markets experience some seasonality. Our sales in the automotive market are dependent upon global automotive production, and seasonal declines in European production may negatively impact net sales in the fourth fiscal quarter. Also, our sales in the energy market typically increase in the third and fourth fiscal quarters as customer activity increases.

Customer orders and demand may fluctuate as a result of economic and market conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures. Backlog by reportable segment was as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We expect that the majority of our backlog at fiscal year end 2022 will be filled during fiscal 2023. Backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales as unfilled orders may be cancelled prior to shipment of goods.

Competition

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with thousands of companies that range from large multinational corporations to local manufacturers. Competition is generally based on breadth of product offering, product innovation, price, quality, delivery, and service. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, downward pressure on prices. However, as a result of increased costs, certain of our businesses implemented price increases in fiscal 2022 and 2021.

Raw Materials

We use a wide variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. The principal raw materials that we use include plastic resins for molding; precious metals such as gold and silver for plating; and other metals such as copper, aluminum, brass, and steel for manufacturing cable, contacts, and other parts that are used for cable and component bodies and inserts. Many of these raw materials are produced in a limited number of countries around the world or are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The prices of these materials are driven by global supply and demand. In recent years, raw material prices and availability have been affected by worldwide economic conditions, including the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and inflationary cost pressures.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We own a large portfolio of patents that relate principally to electrical, optical, and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

4 
While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position or our operations are dependent upon or would be materially impacted by any single patent or group of related patents.

Human Capital Management

We have employees located throughout the world. As of fiscal year end 2022, we employed approximately 92,000 people worldwide, including contract employees. Approximately 27,000 were in the Asia–Pacific region, 37,000 were in the EMEA region, and 28,000 were in the Americas region. Of our total employees, approximately 56,000 were employed in manufacturing. Our strong employee base, along with their commitment to uncompromising values, provides the foundation of our company’s success. 

Our core values—integrity, accountability, teamwork, and innovation—govern us. They guide our decisions and our actions, both individually and as an organization. Additionally, our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose—to create a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future. We track and report internally on key talent metrics including workforce demographics, critical role pipeline data, diversity data, and engagement and inclusion indices. We aspire to have more than 26% women in leadership roles by fiscal 2025 and are committed to increasing the total number of women across all levels of the organization. Additionally, as part of its charter, the management development and compensation committee of our board of directors oversees our policies and practices related to the management of human capital resources including talent management, culture, diversity, and inclusion. 

We embrace diversity and inclusion. A truly innovative workforce needs to be diverse and leverage the skills and perspectives of a wealth of backgrounds and experiences. To drive our business outcomes globally, we believe we must build a workforce and supplier network that represents our global markets and the customers we serve. We are also committed to a work environment where all employees are engaged, feel differences are valued and mutually-respected, and believe that all opinions count. Our people reflect our customers and markets. Our employees are in over 55 countries representing approximately 125 nationalities, and our total employee population is over 40% women. Our employee resource groups (“ERGs”) are company-sponsored, voluntary, employee-led groups that focus on diverse talent segments or shared experiences of employees. These groups apply those perspectives to create value for our company as a whole. The ERGs provide a space where employees can foster connections and develop in a supportive environment. As of fiscal year end 2022, we had eight ERGs—ALIGN (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer/questioning employees and their allies), Women in Networking, TE Young Professionals, African Heritage, Asian Heritage, Latin Heritage, THRIVE (employees and their allies with mental, emotional, and physical disabilities), and TE Veterans. Our ERGs have a total of over 8,000 members. 

During fiscal 2022, we conducted our third annual employee engagement survey, which was a fully digital, enterprise-wide survey available in 17 languages and focused on measuring engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. We had a participation rate of over 85% in fiscal 2022 and year over year improvement in all three indices of engagement, inclusion, and leadership effectiveness. Our engagement and inclusion scores were once again favorable when compared to Glint Inc.’s external global manufacturing benchmark. By fiscal 2025, we aspire to be in the top tier of this benchmark on engagement and inclusion. In addition to the overall improvement in our leadership effectiveness index, all nine scores within the index also increased from fiscal 2021 levels.

We continue to emphasize employee development and training to support engagement and retention. To empower employees to unleash their potential, we provide a range of development programs and opportunities, skills, and resources they need to be successful. Our LEARN@TE platform supplements our talent development strategies. It is an online portal that enables employees to access instructor-led classroom or virtual courses and self-directed web-based courses. Strategy, execution, and talent (“SET”) leadership expectations, which focus on how we drive strategy, effectively execute, and build talent, have been rolled out to all employees and are embedded in all of our leadership programs. We integrate these behavioral expectations into the way we assess and select talent, manage performance, and develop and reward our people. 

We are committed to identifying and developing our next generation of leaders. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established specialized programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in general management, engineering, and operations, as well as the diversity of our talent. We are focused on both the recruitment of diverse candidates and the development of our diverse employees to provide the opportunity to advance their careers and move into leadership positions within the company. On an annual basis, we conduct an organization and leadership review process with our chief executive officer and all segment, business unit, and function leaders focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diverse talent, and the succession for our most critical 

5 
roles. Also, our board of directors reviews and assesses management development plans for senior executives and the succession plans relating to those positions.

We are committed to the safety, health, human rights, and well-being of our employees. We continuously evaluate opportunities to raise safety and health standards through our environmental, health, and safety team. Compliance audits and internal processes are in place to stay ahead of workplace hazards, and we aim to reduce our Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) total recordable incident rate—a rate equivalent to the number of incidents per 100 employees or 200,000 work hours—to 0.12 by fiscal 2025. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took additional actions to protect the physical and mental health and well-being of our global employees. We have utilized our workplace flexibility guidelines, promoted our Wellbeing Connection program and health care benefits to support the needs of all employees, and instituted additional safety measures at all factories and sites. We are striving to implement a global human rights program. We have recently instituted a global human rights policy and a human trafficking and modern slavery policy. We apply high standards of human rights and require that our suppliers do the same.

We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively execute our strategy and advance our product and technology leadership. Our chief executive officer and segment leaders average over 25 years of industry experience. They are supported by an experienced and talented management team who is dedicated to maintaining and expanding our position as a global leader in the industry. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see “Part 1. Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. A small portion of our products, including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding trade compliance matters. Also, see “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with trade regulations.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, including those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, greenhouse gas emissions, hazardous materials in products, and chemical usage. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate policies and standards; staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues; periodic compliance auditing; training; and other measures. We also have a program for compliance with the European Union (“EU”) Restriction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directives; the China Administrative Measures for the Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (“China RoHS”) regulation; the EU Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) regulation; and similar laws.

Compliance with these laws has increased our costs of doing business in a variety of ways and may continue to do so in the future. For example, laws regarding product content and chemical registration require extensive and costly data collection, management, and reporting, and laws regulating greenhouse gas emissions may increase our costs for energy and certain materials and products. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing sites to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, available information, and applicable laws, as of fiscal year end 2022, we concluded that we would incur investigation and remediation costs at these sites in the reasonably possible range of $17 million to $44 million, and we accrued $20 million as the probable loss, which was the best estimate within this range. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2023 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.

Sustainability

We look to build on our strong foundation of environmental sustainability in our operations. Our One Connected World strategy guides how we balance investor and customer expectations and drive improved environmental sustainability. 

Our sustainability initiatives in our operations began more than ten years ago. From fiscal 2010 to 2022, we achieved more than a 20% reduction in absolute energy usage, more than a 25% reduction in absolute water usage, and more than a 50% reduction in absolute greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2). Over the last few years, we have recycled approximately 80% of the waste materials from our operations. We have challenged ourselves to find new ways to continue to drive sustainability improvements. In fiscal 2022, we:

●continued to make progress on our goal to further reduce our absolute greenhouse gas emissions (Scopes 1 and 2) by more than 40%, from our fiscal 2020 baseline, by fiscal 2030;

●made progress towards our target to decrease water withdrawals by 15%, from our fiscal 2021 baseline, by fiscal 2025 at 30 sites with extremely high and high water stress;

●made progress towards our target to decrease hazardous waste disposed by 15%, from our fiscal 2021 baseline, by fiscal 2025;

●remained committed to sourcing renewable energy, developing and implementing energy efficiency projects, and strengthening operating standards; and

●worked with key suppliers to reduce Scope 3 emissions.

While sustainability is embedded in our operations, we are exploring opportunities with our direct suppliers and logistics service providers to strengthen the environmental sustainability of our supply chain. The majority of our greenhouse gas emissions are from the goods and services we use in our operations. In addition to improving the sustainability of our operations and working with our suppliers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, we help our customers produce smaller, lighter, and more energy-efficient products, reducing the environmental impact of the products our customers make through the life of their products. With every product that comes out of our facilities, we support a safer, sustainable, productive, and connected future.
