PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Baker Hughes Holdings LLC ("BHH LLC", "the Company", "we", "us", or "our") is an energy technology company with a diversified portfolio of technologies and services that span the energy and industrial value chain. We conduct business in more than 120 countries. The Company was formed in July 2017 as the result of a combination between Baker Hughes Incorporated ("BHI") and the oil and gas business ("GE O&G") of General Electric Company ("GE") ("the Transactions"). In 2020, GE launched a program to fully divest of its ownership in Baker Hughes Company ("Baker Hughes") and BHH LLC over approximately three years. As of December 31, 2021, GE owns 11.4% of our common units and Baker Hughes owns directly or indirectly 88.6% of our common units (collectively, "the Members").

OUR VISION & STRATEGY

With the breadth of our portfolio, leading technology, and unique partnership models, we are positioned to deliver outcome-based solutions across the industry. By integrating health, safety & environment ("HSE") into everything we do, we protect our people, our customers, and the environment. 

The oil and gas macroeconomic environment continues to be dynamic. We believe the world’s reliance on hydrocarbons will not disappear, and oil and gas will continue to remain relevant in meeting global energy demand. At the same time, the transition to new energy sources is accelerating. We believe the industry is going through a transformation that requires a change in how we work. Irrespective of commodity prices, our customers are focused on reducing both capital and operating expenditures. Our customers expect new models and solutions to deliver sustainable productivity improvements and leverage economies of scale, with a lower carbon footprint. That is why our strategy is focused on improving our core competitiveness and delivering higher-productivity solutions today, while positioning for the energy transition.

Our strategy is based on three key pillars:

•Transform the core: We are transforming our current business to improve margins and cash flow, which we are achieving through portfolio rationalization, cost improvements, and new business models.

•Invest for growth: We are driving organic and inorganic growth in high potential segments where we have a strong position, including industrial power and processes, industrial asset management, non-metallics, and chemicals.

•Position for new energy frontiers: We are making strategic investments to drive lower carbon emissions in the energy and industrial sectors, including hydrogen, geothermal, carbon capture, utilization and storage ("CCUS"), and energy storage.

We expect to benefit from our strategy in the following ways:

•Scope and scale: We have global presence and a broad, diversified portfolio. Our products, services, and expertise serve the upstream, midstream/liquefied natural gas ("LNG") and downstream sectors of the oil and gas industry, as well as broader chemical and industrial segments. We deliver through our four product companies (also referred to as "operating segments"): Oilfield Services; Oilfield Equipment; Turbomachinery & Process Solutions; and Digital Solutions as discussed below under "Products and Services," and each are among the top four providers for the majority of the product lines in the markets they serve.

•Technology: Our culture is built on a heritage of innovation and invention in research and development, with complementary capabilities. Technology remains a differentiator for us, and a key enabler to drive the efficiency and productivity gains our customers need. We also have a range of technologies that support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint. We remain committed to investing in our products and services to maintain our leadership position across our offerings, including $492 million research and development spend and being granted more than 2,500 patents worldwide in 2021.

Baker Hughes Holdings LLC 2021 Form 10-K | 1

•Digital capabilities: We expect to benefit from the emerging demand for artificial intelligence ("AI") based solutions as part of our customers’ digital transformation initiatives. Launched in 2019, our partnership with C3.ai, Inc. ("C3 AI") is enabling us to deliver AI that is faster, easier, and more scalable to drive outcomes for our customers. We are delivering existing technology to oil and gas customers and collaborating on new AI applications specific for oil and gas outcomes. We are also deploying C3 AI applications internally to improve operational efficiencies, specifically for inventory optimization. In addition, we have continued to invest in our industrial asset management capabilities, including the acquisition of ARMS Reliability and an investment in Augury, a machine health technology company, to support our customers’ digital transformation programs across industrial end markets.

•Energy transition solutions: We are positioned to support our customers' efforts to reduce their carbon footprint with a range of emissions-reduction products and services. This includes more efficient power generation and compression technology that reduces carbon emissions, including CCUS, as well as hydrogen technologies. We also have a range of inspection and sensor technologies that can monitor and help reduce flaring and emissions. In 2021, we made strategic investments in emerging energy technologies to advance CCUS and hydrogen with companies such as Ekona Power, Electrochaea, and the Hy24 Hydrogen Fund; and entered into new partnerships with Shell, Air Products, and Bloom Energy, among others. We also continue to expand our emissions management capabilities, helping customers to detect and quantify emissions more efficiently and accurately, and complementing our existing methane detection and quantification solutions available today.

In 2021, we took additional steps to accelerate our strategy and to view our Company in two broad business areas: Oilfield Services & Equipment and Industrial Energy Technology. This approach aims to better position Baker Hughes for today and in the coming years. We believe that focusing on two major business areas with close alignment will enhance our flexibility, improve commercial and operational execution, and provide long-term optionality as the energy markets evolve.

On the Oilfield Services & Equipment ("OFSE") side of the Company, we have a technology-leading global enterprise with core strengths in drilling services, high-end completion tools, flexible pipe, artificial lift, and production and downstream chemicals. OFSE is poised to benefit from cyclical growth in the coming years as we believe that we are in the early stages of a broad based, multi-year recovery that will be characterized by longer term investments into the core OPEC+ countries.

The Industrial Energy Technology ("IET") encompasses a more closely integrated Turbomachinery & Process Solutions and Digital Solutions. Both businesses have compelling portfolios that are beginning to see significant secular growth opportunities, particularly in areas such as hydrogen and CCUS. With core competencies across a number of offerings like power generation, compression, and condition monitoring, as well as a growing presence in flow control and industrial asset management, we have a strong foundation on which to build an even more comprehensive presence in the broad industrial energy technology markets.

More recently, we created the Climate Technology Solutions ("CTS") and the Industrial Asset Management ("IAM") groups to further support the strategy of the Company. CTS will include CCUS, hydrogen, emissions management, and clean and integrated power solutions. IAM will bring together key digital capabilities, software, and hardware from across the Company to help customers increase efficiencies, improve performance, and reduce emissions for their energy and industrial assets. We believe the creation of these two groups will help accelerate the speed of commercial development for solutions-based business models across our new energy and industrial asset management offerings. These actions, including the steps taken to view our Company in two broad areas, OFSE and IET, will not change our current segment reporting structure.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

We believe we have an important role to play in society as an industry leader and partner. We view environmental, social, and governance ("ESG") as a key lever to transform the performance of our Company and our industry. In January 2019, we made a commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions from our operations by 50% by 2030, achieving net zero emissions by 2050. In 2020, we reset our carbon emissions reduction base year from 2012 to 2019 to account for corporate changes, new acquisitions, divestitures, and to reflect changes in methodology in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We are investing in our portfolio of advanced technologies to assist customers with reducing their carbon footprint.

Baker Hughes Holdings LLC 2021 Form 10-K | 2

We continue to make progress on emissions reductions. Baker Hughes reported in its 2020 Corporate Responsibility report a 15% reduction in operating greenhouse gas emissions over the prior year. This reduction was partially due to lower activity during the COVID-19 pandemic, but also due to efficiency and emissions reduction efforts across our global business, including facility energy efficiency and operational energy efficiency, uptake of renewable and zero-carbon energy, and emissions reduction in our vehicle fleets. We will continue to employ a broad range of emissions reduction initiatives across manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, energy sourcing and generation.

CONTRACTS

We conduct our business under various types of contracts in the upstream, midstream, and downstream segments, including fixed-fee or turnkey contracts, transactional agreements for products and services, and long-term aftermarket service agreements.

We enjoy stable relationships with many of our customers based on long-term project contracts and master service agreements. Several of those contracts require us to commit to a fixed price based on the customer’s technical specifications with little or no relief available due to changes in circumstances. In some cases, failure to deliver products or perform services within contractual commitments may lead to liquidated damages claims. We seek to mitigate these exposures through close collaboration with our customers.

Baker Hughes Holdings LLC 2021 Form 10-K | 5

We strive to negotiate the terms of our customer contracts consistent with what we consider to be industry best practices. Our customers typically indemnify us for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of their employees and often their contractors; the loss of or damage to their facility and equipment, and often that of their contractors; pollution originating from their equipment or facility; and all liabilities related to the well and subsurface operations, including loss or damage to the well or reservoir, loss of well control, fire, explosion, or any uncontrolled flow of oil or gas. Conversely, we typically indemnify our customers for certain claims arising from: the injury or death of our employees and often that of our subcontractors; the loss of or damage to our equipment; and surface pollution originating from our equipment while under our control. Where the above indemnities do not apply or are not consistent with industry best practices, we typically provide a capped indemnity for damages caused to the customer by our negligence, and include an overall limitation of liability clause. It is also our general practice to include a limitation of liability for consequential loss, including loss of profits and loss of revenue, in all customer contracts.

Our indemnity structure may not protect us in every case. Certain U.S. states have enacted oil and natural gas specific anti-indemnity statutes that can void the allocation of liability agreed to in a contract. Applicable law or the negotiated terms of a customer contract may also limit indemnity obligations in the event of gross negligence or willful misconduct. We sometimes contract with customers that are not the end user of our products. It is our practice to seek to obtain an indemnity from our customer for any end-user claims, but this is not always possible. Similarly, government agencies and other third parties may make claims in respect of which we are not indemnified and for which responsibility is assessed proportionate to fault. We have an established process to review any risk deviations from our standard contracting practices.

The Company maintains a commercial general liability insurance policy program that covers against certain operating hazards, including product liability claims and personal injury claims, as well as certain limited environmental pollution claims for damage to a third party or its property arising out of contact with pollution for which the Company is liable; however, clean up and well control costs are not covered by such program. All of the insurance policies purchased by the Company are subject to deductible and/or self-insured retention amounts for which we are responsible for payment, specific terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions. There can be no assurance that the nature and amount of Company insurance will be sufficient to fully indemnify us against liabilities related to our business.

ORDERS AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS

Remaining performance obligations, a defined term under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), are unfilled customer orders for products and product services excluding any purchase order that provides the customer with the ability to cancel or terminate without incurring a substantive penalty, even if the likelihood of cancellation is remote based on historical experience. For product services, an amount is included for the expected life of the contract.

We recognized orders of $21.7 billion, $20.7 billion and $27.0 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the remaining performance obligations totaled $23.6 billion, $23.4 billion and $22.9 billion, respectively.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We engage in research and development activities directed primarily toward the development of new products, services, technology, and other solutions, as well as the improvement of existing products, services and the design of specialized products to meet specific customer needs.

We rely on patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure and employee invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Many patents and patent applications comprise the Baker Hughes portfolio and are owned by us. Other patents and patent applications applicable to our products and services are licensed to us by GE and, in some cases, third parties. We do not consider any individual patent to be material to our business operations.

BHH LLC and GE have an IP cross-license agreement ("the IP Cross-License Agreement") where GE agreed to perpetually license to BHH LLC the right to use certain intellectual property owned or controlled by GE pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. BHH LLC in return, also agreed to perpetually license to GE the right to use certain intellectual property rights owned or controlled by BHH LLC pursuant to the terms of the IP Cross-License Agreement. This IP Cross-License Agreement allows both parties to have continued and permanent rights to commercially utilize certain intellectual property of the other pursuant to the terms of the agreement. The IP cross-licenses remain in place irrespective of GE's ownership level in BHH LLC.

We follow a policy of seeking patent and trademark protection in numerous countries and regions throughout the world for products and methods that appear to have commercial significance. We believe that maintenance, protection and enforcement of our patents, trademarks, and related intellectual property rights is central to the conduct of our business, and aggressively pursue protection of our intellectual property rights against infringement, misappropriation, or other violation worldwide as may be necessary to protect our business. Additionally, we consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skills of our personnel to be other important components of the portfolio of capabilities and assets supporting our ability to compete.

SEASONALITY

Our operations can be affected by seasonal events, which can temporarily affect the delivery and performance of our products and services, and our customers' budgetary cycles. Examples of seasonal events that can impact our business are set forth below:

•Adverse weather conditions, such as hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico, may interrupt or curtail our coastal and offshore drilling, or our customers’ operations, cause supply disruptions and result in a loss of revenue and damage to our equipment and facilities, which may or may not be insured. Other adverse weather conditions could include extreme heat in the Middle East during the summer months which may impact our operations or our customers' operations.

•The severity and duration of both the summer and the winter in North America can have a significant impact on activity levels. In Canada, the timing and duration of the spring thaw directly affects activity levels, which reach seasonal lows during the second quarter and build through the third and fourth quarters to a seasonal high in the first quarter.

•Severe weather during the winter months normally results in reduced activity levels in the North Sea and Russia generally in the first quarter and may interrupt or curtail our operations, or our customers’ operations, in those areas and result in a loss of revenue.

•Many of our international oilfield customers may increase activity for certain products and services in the fourth quarter as they seek to fully utilize their annual budgets.

•Our process & pipeline business in the DS segment typically experiences lower sales during the first and fourth quarters of the year due to the Northern Hemisphere winter.

•Our broader DS and TPS businesses typically experience higher customer activity as a result of spending patterns in the second half of the year.

Health, Safety, and Wellness

Health and safety is at the core of our culture as we are committed to doing the right thing to protect our employees, customers, the communities where we live and work, and the environment. We take a risk-based approach with proactive and preventive programs to deliver safe, secure, and sustainable operations. We have established a stringent set of standards which meet or exceed global regulatory requirements.

Our commitment to HSE starts at the highest levels of our company and is embedded throughout all layers of the organization. We encourage and empower all employees to take an active role in "owning" HSE by stopping work when conditions are unsafe and reporting observations, near misses, and stop-work events through open reporting channels. Our ambition is to make every day a Perfect HSE Day—one without injuries, accidents, or harm to the environment. In 2021, we achieved 204 Perfect HSE Days, up 2% versus 2020.

Our teams are required to complete recurring training. We offer more than 250 unique HSE courses including foundational training required for all employees, workplace and job-specific training, and human-performance leadership training for managers.

Our commitment to HSE goes beyond safety alone. Occupational health and wellness is a key competency managed within our HSE center of excellence. The importance of physical health, ergonomics, preventative health care, and mental wellness cannot be overstated in promoting a healthy, engaged, and productive workplace. We work with our health benefit providers and internal teams to offer employees health and wellness programs, telemedicine access, health screenings, immunizations, fitness reimbursements, and virtual wellness tools.

In 2021, the mental health and emotional well-being of our employees continued to be a critical priority. We hosted numerous events with Baker Hughes leaders and external experts, further embedded mental well-being into leadership engagements, and provided resources and tools to employees. Our Employee Assistance Program ("EAP") helps employees navigate daily life to manage remote work, cope with major life events or deal with a global pandemic. The EAP gives employees and their family members direct access to professional coaches for in-the-moment counseling or referrals to community experts and extended care providers.

Leading through COVID-19

We continue to monitor and respond to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic and developing vaccine landscape. Since the start of the pandemic, we have taken prudent steps as a company to reduce the risk and spread of the virus. Our top priorities have remained: protecting our employees, maintaining operations, and supporting customers and communities globally.

Since March 2020, our global crisis management structure has been activated to manage a coordinated pandemic response. We continue to evolve our approach in alignment with global health and safety standards and government requirements across our operations. In addition, travel has remained limited, and we continue to enhance our site safety measures, including screenings, social distancing, vaccination requirements, and face coverings. In addition, vaccine access, including onsite clinics, and education for our employees and communities has remained a critical priority. Many of our office-based employees continue to work remotely. As conditions improved in certain places, we started bringing more employees back to offices and worksites and enabled opportunities for more in-person engagements where it was safe to do so. We continue to closely monitor the situation and will adapt our protocols as needed to protect our employees and deliver for our customers, in alignment with all associated requirements.

Community Involvement

Baker Hughes seeks to make a positive impact in the communities where we operate around the world. Consistent with our purpose and values, we work to advance environmental quality, educational opportunities, health, and wellness. We benefit our communities through financial contributions, in-kind donations of goods and services, and volunteer projects. The Baker Hughes Foundation makes strategic philanthropic contributions, matches Baker Hughes employee charitable contributions, and awards volunteer recognition grants for outstanding employee community service.

Board Oversight of Human Capital Management

Baker Hughes' Board of Directors plays an active role in overseeing the Company's human capital management efforts. Our Human Capital and Compensation Committee provides oversight of our policies, programs, and initiatives focusing on DEI as well as pay equity, culture, talent management, succession planning, and executive compensation and benefits. Our Governance & Corporate Responsibility Committee provides oversight of employee safety, health, and wellness matters.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Environmental Matters

We are committed to the health and safety of people, protection of the environment and compliance with environmental laws, regulations and our policies. Our past and present operations include activities that are subject to extensive domestic (including U.S. federal, state and local) and international regulations concerning, among other things, air and water quality, waste management, and land protection. Environmental regulations continue to evolve, and changes in standards of enforcement of existing regulations, as well as the enactment of new legislation, may require us and our customers to modify, supplement or replace equipment or facilities or to change or discontinue present methods of operation. Our environmental compliance expenditures and our capital costs for environmental control equipment may change accordingly.

We recognize that climate change warrants meaningful action. In 2019, we announced our commitment to reduce our carbon equivalent emissions 50% by 2030 and achieve carbon equivalent net zero emissions by 2050. This goal encompasses emissions from our direct operations ("Scope 1 and 2 emissions") in alignment with the Paris Accord and the specific recommendations of the United Nations ("UN") Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5oC. In 2020, we reset our carbon emissions reduction base year for this goal from 2012 to 2019 to account for corporate changes, new acquisitions, divestitures, and to reflect changes in methodology in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We have proactively worked to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions over the last decade through the implementation of energy-efficiency programs, operational improvements, and increased usage of renewable energy. We also continue efforts to reduce our overall environmental footprint by using materials wisely and preserving land, water, and air quality. Our sustainability commitments include our formal participation in the UN Global Compact and our commitment to the Ten Principles human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. The environmental principles include a precautionary approach to environmental challenges, initiatives to promote a greater sense of environmental responsibility and the development of environmentally friendly technologies. We have annually renewed our commitment to the UN Global Compact since joining in 2019.

While we seek to embed and verify sound environmental practices throughout our business, we are, and may in the future be, involved in voluntary remediation projects at current and former properties, typically related to historical operations. On rare occasions, our remediation activities are conducted as specified by a government agency-issued consent decree or agreed order. Remediation costs at these properties are accrued using currently available facts, existing environmental permits, technology and presently enacted laws and regulations. For sites where we are primarily responsible for the remediation, our cost estimates are developed based on internal evaluations and are not discounted. We record accruals when it is probable that we will be obligated to pay amounts for environmental site evaluation, remediation or related activities, and such amounts can be reasonably estimated. Accruals are recorded even if significant uncertainties exist over the ultimate cost of the remediation. Ongoing environmental compliance costs, such as obtaining environmental permits, installation and maintenance of pollution control equipment and waste disposal, are expensed as incurred.

The U.S. Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (known as "Superfund") imposes liability for the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment. Superfund liability is imposed without regard to fault, even if the waste disposal was in compliance with laws and regulations. We have been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at various Superfund sites, and we accrue our share, if known, of the estimated remediation costs for the site. PRPs in Superfund actions have joint and several liability and may be required to pay more than their proportional share of such costs.

In some cases, it is not possible to quantify our ultimate exposure because the projects are either in the investigative or early remediation stage, or superfund allocation information is not yet available. Based upon current information, we believe that our overall compliance with environmental regulations, including remediation obligations, environmental compliance costs and capital expenditures for environmental control equipment, will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position because we have either established adequate reserves or our compliance cost, based on available information, is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Our total accrual for environmental remediation was $67 million and $78 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We continue to focus on reducing future environmental liabilities by maintaining appropriate Company standards and by improving our environmental assurance programs.

Other Regulatory Matters

We are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal regulatory agencies and by the applicable regulatory authorities in countries in which our products are manufactured or sold. Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, classification, labeling, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, advertising and marketing of our products. Additionally, as a U.S. entity operating through subsidiaries in non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are subject to foreign exchange control, transfer pricing and customs laws that regulate the import and export of goods as well as the flow of funds between us and our subsidiaries. In particular, the shipment of goods, services and technology across international borders subjects us to extensive trade laws and regulations. Our import activities are governed by the unique customs laws and regulations in each of the countries where we operate. Pursuant to their laws and regulations, governments may impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons and entities that may restrict or prohibit transactions involving such countries, persons and entities, which may limit or prevent our conduct of business in certain jurisdictions. We are also required to be in compliance with transfer pricing, securities laws and other statutes and regulations, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA") and other countries’ anti-corruption and anti-bribery regimes.

In addition, we are subject to laws relating to data privacy and security and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments worldwide have established laws and regulations, and industry groups also have promoted various standards, regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data. The legal and regulatory environment related to data privacy and security is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and enforcement practices are likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. We are also subject to labor and employment laws, including regulations established by the U.S. Department of Labor and other local regulatory agencies, which sets laws governing working conditions, paid leave, workplace safety, wage and hour standards, and hiring and employment practices.

While there are no current regulatory matters that we expect to be material to our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows, there can be no assurances that existing or future environmental laws and other laws, regulations and standards applicable to our operations or products will not lead to a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
