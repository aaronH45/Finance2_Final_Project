Segment Information

(PPL)

PPL is organized into two reportable segments as depicted in the chart above: Kentucky Regulated, which primarily represents the results of LG&E and KU, and Pennsylvania Regulated, which primarily represents the results of PPL Electric. "Corporate and Other" primarily includes financing costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments. 

A comparison of PPL's Regulated segments is shown below.

(a)Represents capitalization for Kentucky Regulated and rate base for Pennsylvania Regulated. 

See Note 2 to the Financial Statements for additional financial information by segment. The sale of the U.K. utility business, which substantially represented PPL’s U.K. Regulated segment as reported in prior years, was completed on June 14, 2021, pursuant to a share purchase agreement entered into on March 17, 2021. As a result, PPL determined segment information for the U.K. Regulated segment would no longer be provided beginning with the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2021. See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)

PPL Electric has two operating segments, distribution and transmission, which are aggregated into a single reportable segment. LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments.

Kentucky Regulated Segment (PPL)

The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, the Kentucky Regulated segment includes certain financing and other costs at LKE.

(PPL, LG&E and KU)

LG&E and KU are engaged in the regulated generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, also Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. LG&E provides electricity service to approximately 429,000 customers in Louisville and adjacent areas in Kentucky, covering approximately 700 square miles in nine counties and provides natural gas service to approximately 333,000 customers in its electricity service area and eight additional counties in Kentucky. KU provides electric service to approximately 538,000 customers in 77 counties in central, southeastern and western Kentucky and approximately 28,000 customers in five counties in southwestern Virginia, covering approximately 4,800 non-contiguous square miles. KU also sells wholesale electricity to two municipalities in Kentucky under load following contracts. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.

Franchises and Licenses

LG&E and KU provide electricity delivery service, and LG&E provides natural gas distribution service, in their respective service territories pursuant to certain franchises, licenses, statutory service areas, easements and other rights or permissions granted by state legislatures, cities or municipalities or other entities. 

4
Competition

There are currently no other electric public utilities operating within the electricity service areas of LG&E and KU. From time to time, bills are introduced into the Kentucky General Assembly which seek to authorize, promote or mandate increased distributed generation, customer choice or other developments. Neither the Kentucky General Assembly nor the KPSC has adopted or approved a plan or timetable for retail electric industry competition in Kentucky. The nature or timing of legislative or regulatory actions, if any, regarding industry restructuring and their impact on LG&E and KU, which may be significant, cannot currently be predicted. Virginia, formerly a deregulated jurisdiction, has enacted legislation that implemented a hybrid model of cost-based regulation. KU's operations in Virginia have been and remain regulated. 

Alternative energy sources such as electricity, oil, propane and other fuels indirectly impact LG&E's natural gas revenues. Marketers may also compete to sell natural gas to certain large end-users. LG&E's natural gas tariffs include gas price pass-through mechanisms relating to its sale of natural gas as a commodity. Therefore, customer natural gas purchases from alternative suppliers do not generally impact LG&E's profitability. Some large industrial and commercial customers, however, may physically bypass LG&E's facilities and seek delivery service directly from interstate pipelines or other natural gas distribution systems.

Power Supply

At December 31, 2021, LG&E owned generating capacity of 2,760 MW and KU owned generating capacity of 4,775 MW. See "Item 2. Properties - Kentucky Regulated Segment" for a complete list of generating facilities. 

The system capacity of LG&E's and KU's owned generation is based upon several factors, including the operating experience and physical condition of the units, and may be revised periodically to reflect changes in circumstances.

During 2021, LG&E's and KU's power plants generated the following amounts of electricity:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)This generation represents increases for LG&E and KU of 4% and 5% from 2020 output.

The majority of LG&E's and KU's generated electricity was used to supply their retail customer bases.

LG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa.

Due to environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, as of December 31, 2021, LG&E and KU have retired approximately 1,200 MW of coal-fired generation plants since 2010.

LG&E and KU received approval from the KPSC to develop a 4 MW Solar Share facility to service a Solar Share program. The Solar Share program is a voluntary program that allows customers to subscribe capacity in the Solar Share facility. Construction commences, in 500-kilowatt phases, when subscription is complete. Construction of four 500-kilowatt phases was completed as of December 31, 2021. The subscription for the fifth 500-kilowatt phase was completed with construction expected to be completed in 2022. LG&E and KU continue to market the program and have started receiving subscriptions for the sixth 500-kilowatt phase.

On January 23, 2020, LG&E and KU applied to the KPSC for approval of arrangements relating to the purchase of 100 MW of solar power in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed third-party solar generation facility and resell the bulk of the power as renewable energy to two large industrial customers and use the remaining power for other customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2023. On May 8, 2020, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E’s and KU’s applications with certain modifications. LG&E and KU requested reconsideration of limited portions of the KPSC's Order and on December 16, 2020, the KPSC amended their original order. 

5
PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that these arrangements will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition. 

On October 6, 2021, LG&E and KU entered into an agreement to purchase the initial 20 years of output of a proposed 125 MW third-party solar generation facility in connection with the Green Tariff option established in the 2018 Kentucky base rate cases. Pursuant to the agreements, LG&E and KU would purchase output of the facility and resell power as renewable energy to certain large customers. The generation facility is currently expected to be operational in the fourth quarter of 2024. PPL, LG&E and KU do not anticipate that this agreement will have a significant impact on their results of operations or financial condition. 

Fuel Supply

Coal and natural gas are expected to be the predominant fuels used by LG&E and KU for generation for the foreseeable future. Natural gas used for generation is primarily purchased using contractual arrangements separate from LG&E's natural gas distribution operations. Natural gas and oil are also used for intermediate and peaking capacity and flame stabilization in coal-fired boilers.

Fuel inventory is maintained at levels estimated to be necessary to avoid operational disruptions at coal-fired generating units. Reliability of coal deliveries can be affected from time to time by several factors including fluctuations in demand, coal mine production issues, high or low river level events, lock outages and other supplier or transporter operating or financial difficulties.

LG&E and KU have entered into coal supply agreements with various suppliers for coal deliveries through 2026 and augment their coal supply agreements with spot market purchases, as needed.

For their existing units, LG&E and KU expect, for the foreseeable future, to purchase most of their coal from western Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Illinois, northern West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. LG&E and KU continue to purchase certain quantities of ultra-low sulfur content coal from Wyoming for blending at Trimble County Unit 2. Coal is delivered to the generating plants primarily by barge and rail.

To enhance the reliability of natural gas supply, LG&E and KU have secured firm long-term pipeline transport capacity services with contracts of various durations through 2024 on the interstate pipeline serving Cane Run Unit 7. This pipeline also serves the six simple cycle combustion turbine units located at the Trimble County site as well as two other simple cycle units at the Paddy's Run site. For the seven simple cycle combustion turbines at the E.W. Brown facility, no firm long-term pipeline transport capacity has been purchased due to the facility's connection to two interstate pipelines and some of the units having dual fuel capability.

LG&E and KU have firm contracts for a portion of the natural gas fuel for Cane Run Unit 7 through October 2024. The bulk of the natural gas fuel remains purchased on the spot market. 

(PPL and LG&E)

Natural Gas Distribution Supply

Five underground natural gas storage fields, with a current working natural gas capacity of approximately 15 billion cubic feet (Bcf), are used to provide natural gas service to LG&E's firm sales customers. Natural gas is stored during the summer season for withdrawal during the following winter heating season. Without this storage capacity, LG&E would need to purchase additional natural gas and pipeline transportation services during winter months when customer demand increases and the prices for natural gas supply and transportation services are expected to be higher. At December 31, 2021, LG&E had 12 Bcf of natural gas stored underground with a carrying value of $54 million.

LG&E has a portfolio of supply arrangements of varying durations and terms that provide competitively priced natural gas designed to meet its firm sales obligations. These natural gas supply arrangements include pricing provisions that are market-responsive. In tandem with pipeline transportation services, these natural gas supplies provide the reliability and flexibility necessary to serve LG&E's natural gas customers.

LG&E purchases natural gas supply transportation services from two pipelines. LG&E has contracts with one pipeline that are subject to termination by LG&E between 2023 and 2026. Total winter season capacity under these contracts is 184,900 MMBtu/day and summer season capacity is 60,000 MMBtu/day. With this same pipeline, LG&E also has another contract for 

6
pipeline capacity through 2026 for 60,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons. LG&E has a single contract with a second pipeline with a total capacity of 20,000 MMBtu/day during both the winter and summer seasons that expires in 2023.

LG&E expects to purchase natural gas supplies for its gas distribution operations from onshore producing regions in South Texas, East Texas, North Louisiana and Arkansas, as well as gas originating in the Marcellus and Utica production areas.

(PPL, LG&E and KU)

Transmission

LG&E and KU contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority to act as their transmission reliability coordinator and contract with TranServ International, Inc. to act as their independent transmission organization.

Rates

LG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, FERC and VSCC. LG&E and KU operate under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff.

LG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets in Kentucky.

KU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.

KU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. In April 2014, certain municipalities submitted notices of termination to cease taking power under the wholesale requirements contracts. KU's service to eight municipalities terminated effective April 30, 2019. KU continues to provide service to two municipalities.

See "Financial and Operational Developments" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on current rate proceedings and rate mechanisms.

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment (PPL)

The Pennsylvania Regulated segment consists of PPL Electric, a regulated public utility engaged in the distribution and transmission of electricity.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

PPL Electric delivers electricity to approximately 1.4 million customers in a 10,000-square mile territory in 29 counties within eastern and central Pennsylvania. PPL Electric also provides electricity to retail customers in this territory as a PLR under the Customer Choice Act. See Note 3 to the Financial Statements for revenue information.

Franchise, Licenses and Other Regulations

PPL Electric is authorized to provide electric public utility service throughout its service area as a result of grants by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in corporate charters to PPL Electric and companies which it has succeeded, and as a result of certification by the PUC. PPL Electric is granted the right to enter the streets and highways by the Commonwealth subject to certain conditions. In general, such conditions have been met by ordinance, resolution, permit, acquiescence or other action by an appropriate local political subdivision or agency of the Commonwealth.

7
Competition

Pursuant to authorizations from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the PUC, PPL Electric operates a regulated distribution monopoly in its service area. Accordingly, PPL Electric does not face competition in its electricity distribution business. Pursuant to the Customer Choice Act, generation of electricity is a competitive business in Pennsylvania, and PPL Electric does not own or operate any generation facilities.

The PPL Electric transmission business, operating under a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff, is subject to competition pursuant to FERC Order 1000 from entities that are not incumbent PJM transmission owners with respect to the construction and ownership of transmission facilities within PJM.

Rates and Regulation

Transmission

PPL Electric's transmission facilities are within PJM, which operates the electricity transmission network and electric energy market in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the U.S.

PJM serves as a FERC-approved Regional Transmission Operator (RTO) to promote greater participation and competition in the region it serves. In addition to operating the electricity transmission network, PJM also administers regional markets for energy, capacity and ancillary services. A primary objective of any RTO is to separate the operation of, and access to, the transmission grid from market participants that buy or sell electricity in the same markets. Electric utilities continue to own the transmission assets and to receive their share of transmission revenues, but the RTO directs the control and operation of the transmission facilities. Certain types of transmission investments are subject to competitive processes outlined in the PJM tariff.

As a transmission owner, PPL Electric's transmission revenues are recovered through PJM and billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that allows recovery of incurred transmission costs, a return on transmission-related plant and an automatic annual update based on a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, rates are put into effect in June of each year based upon prior year actual expenditures and current year forecasted capital additions. Rates are then adjusted the following year to reflect actual annual expenses and capital additions, as reported in PPL Electric’s annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC’s Uniform System of Accounts. Any difference between the revenue requirement in effect for the prior year and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. Any change in the prior year PPL zonal peak load billing factor applied on January 1 of each year will result in an increase or decrease in revenue until the next annual rate update is effective on June 1 of that same year.

As a PLR, PPL Electric also purchases transmission services from PJM. See "PLR" below.

See "Financial and Operational Developments" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and regulatory matters.

Distribution

PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on a return on rate base (net utility plant plus a cash working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). All regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base. Therefore, no return is earned on the related assets unless specifically provided for by the PUC. Currently, PPL Electric's Smart Meter rider and the DSIC are the only riders authorized to earn a return. Certain operating expenses are also included in PPL Electric's distribution base rates including wages and benefits, other operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and taxes.

Pennsylvania's Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard (AEPS) requires electricity distribution companies and electricity generation suppliers to obtain from alternative energy resources a portion of the electricity sold to retail customers in Pennsylvania. Under the default service procurement plans approved by the PUC, PPL Electric purchases all of the alternative energy generation supply it needs to comply with the AEPS.

Act 129 created an energy efficiency and conservation program, a demand side management program, smart metering technology requirements, new PLR generation supply procurement rules, remedies for market misconduct and changes to the existing AEPS.

8
Act 11 authorizes the PUC to approve two specific ratemaking mechanisms: the use of a fully projected future test year in base rate proceedings and, subject to certain conditions, the use of a DSIC. Such alternative ratemaking procedures and mechanisms provide opportunity for accelerated cost-recovery and, therefore, are important to PPL Electric as it is in a period of significant capital investment to maintain and enhance the reliability of its delivery system, including the replacement of aging assets. PPL Electric utilized the fully projected future test year mechanism in its 2015 base rate proceeding. PPL has had the ability to utilize the DSIC recovery mechanism since July 2013.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information on rate mechanisms and legislative and regulatory matters.

PLR 

The Customer Choice Act requires electric distribution companies, including PPL Electric, or an alternative supplier approved by the PUC, to act as a PLR of electricity supply for customers who do not choose to shop for supply with a competitive supplier and provides that electricity supply costs will be recovered by the PLR pursuant to PUC regulations. In 2021, the following average percentages of PPL Electric's customer load were provided by competitive suppliers: 39% of residential, 79% of small commercial and industrial and 98% of large commercial and industrial customers. The PUC continues to favor expanding the competitive market for electricity.

PPL Electric’s electricity generation costs are established based upon the results of a competitive solicitation process. On December 17, 2020, the PUC approved PPL Electric’s default service plan for the period June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2025, which includes a total of eight solicitations for electricity supply held semiannually in April and October. The first two auctions of the plan were completed in 2021. This plan also includes eight solicitations for alternative energy credits held semiannually in January and July. Through January 2022, two alternative energy credit solicitations have been completed. All contracts from previous default service plans concluded on or before November 30, 2021.

Pursuant to the plans, PPL Electric contracts for all of the electricity supply for residential, commercial and industrial customers who elect to take default service from PPL Electric. These solicitations contain a mix of products including 5-year block energy contracts for residential customers, 6- and 12-month fixed-price load-following contracts for residential and small commercial and industrial customers, 12-month real-time pricing contracts for large commercial and industrial customers, and alternative energy credit contracts for residential, commercial and industrial customers. These contracts fulfill PPL Electric's obligation to provide customer electricity supply as a PLR.

Numerous alternative suppliers have offered to provide generation supply in PPL Electric's service area. As the cost of generation supply is a pass-through cost for PPL Electric, its financial results are not impacted if its customers purchase electricity supply from these alternative suppliers.

Corporate and Other (PPL)

PPL Services provides PPL subsidiaries with administrative, management and support services. The costs of these services are charged directly to the respective recipients for the services provided or indirectly charged to applicable recipients based on an average of the recipients' relative invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees or a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs.

PPL Capital Funding provides financing for the operations of PPL and certain subsidiaries. PPL's growth in rate-regulated businesses provides the organization with an enhanced corporate level financing alternative, through PPL Capital Funding, that enables PPL to cost effectively support targeted credit profiles across all of PPL's rated companies. As a result, PPL utilizes PPL Capital Funding as a source of capital in financings, in addition to continued direct financing by certain operating subsidiaries.

Unlike PPL Services, PPL Capital Funding's costs are not generally charged to PPL subsidiaries. Costs are charged directly to PPL. However, PPL Capital Funding participated significantly in the financing for the acquisition of LKE and certain associated financing costs were allocated to the Kentucky Regulated Segment. Prior to 2021, the associated financing costs, as well as the financing costs associated with prior issuances of certain other PPL Capital Funding securities, were assigned to the appropriate segments for purposes of PPL management's assessment of segment performance. In 2021, corporate level financing costs are no longer allocated to the reportable segments. The financing costs associated primarily with PPL Capital Funding's securities issuances, with certain exceptions, have not been directly assigned or allocated to any segment.

The financial results of Safari Energy are also reported within Corporate and Other.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

(All Registrants)

The Registrants are subject to certain existing and developing federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations with respect to air and water quality, land use and other environmental matters, and may be subject to different and more stringent such laws and regulations enacted in the future. The EPA and other federal agencies with jurisdiction over environmental matters have issued numerous environmental regulations relating to air, water and waste that directly affect the electric power industry. Due to these environmental issues, it may be necessary for the Registrants to modify or cease certain operations or operation of certain facilities to comply with statutes, regulations and other requirements of regulatory bodies or courts. In addition, legal challenges to environmental permits or rules add uncertainty to estimating future costs of complying with such permits and rules. The Biden administration is currently undertaking changes in a wide range of environmental programs.

See “Legal Matters” in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental commitments and contingencies. See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2022 through 2024. 

LG&E and KU are entitled to recover, through the ECR mechanism, certain costs of complying with the Clean Air Act, as amended, and other federal, state and local environmental requirements applicable to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired generating facilities upon KPSC review. Costs not covered by the ECR mechanism for LG&E and KU and all such costs for PPL Electric are subject to rate recovery at the discretion of the companies' respective state regulatory authorities, or the FERC, if applicable. Because PPL Electric does not own any generating plants, it has less exposure to related environmental compliance costs. The Registrants can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future proceedings before regulatory authorities.

Air

NAAQS (PPL, LG&E and KU)

The Clean Air Act has a significant impact on the operation of fossil fuel generation plants. The Clean Air Act requires the EPA periodically to establish and review National Ambient Air Quality Standards, known as NAAQS, for six pollutants: carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide, ozone (contributed to by nitrogen oxide emissions), particulate matter and sulfur dioxide. In December 2020, the EPA released final actions keeping the existing NAAQS standard for particulate matter and ozone without change, but the EPA is currently reconsidering those decisions. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict the outcome of future evaluations by the EPA and the states with respect to the NAAQS standards.

Applicable regulations require each state to identify areas within its boundaries that fail to meet the NAAQS, (known as nonattainment areas), and develop a state implementation plan to achieve and maintain compliance. States that are found to contribute significantly to another state's nonattainment with ozone standards are required to establish "good neighbor" state implementation plans. In addition, for attainment of ozone and fine particulates standards, certain states, including Kentucky, are subject to a regional EPA program known as the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR). 

In January 2018, the EPA designated Jefferson County, Kentucky (Louisville) as being in nonattainment with the existing 2015 ozone standard. In 2020 and 2021, LG&E entered into agreements with the Louisville Metro Air Pollution Control District for temporary nitrogen oxide emission limits at LG&E's Mill Creek Station during those years to facilitate compliance with the ozone standard. If Jefferson County is unable to demonstrate attainment within the specified timeframes, it may be “bumped up” to the moderate nonattainment classification and thus subject to additional requirements including requirements for installation of reasonably available control technology on coal-fired generating units. Compliance with such requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions. LG&E is unable to determine the impact on operations until certain compliance determinations are made by the EPA and Kentucky.

In April 2021, the EPA published final revisions to the CSAPR providing for reductions in ozone season nitrogen oxide emissions for 2021 and subsequent years from sources in 12 states, including Kentucky. Additionally, the EPA reversed its previous approval of the Kentucky State Implementation Plan with respect to these requirements. The CSAPR revisions are aimed at ensuring compliance with the 2008 ozone NAAQS, so additional nitrogen oxide emission reductions could potentially be required for compliance with the revised 2015 ozone NAAQS. PPL, LG&E and KU do not currently expect the impact of the CSAPR revisions on operations to be material. Pursuant to the President’s executive order, the EPA is currently reconsidering its previous determinations made in December 2020 to retain the existing NAAQS for ozone and particulate matter without change, with final determinations by the EPA expected in 2022 for particulate matter and 2023 for ozone.

10
PPL, LG&E, and KU are unable to predict future emission reductions that may be required by future federal rules or state implementation actions. Compliance with the NAAQS, CSAPR and related requirements may require installation of additional pollution controls or other compliance actions, inclusive of retirements, the costs of which PPL, LG&E and KU believe would be subject to rate recovery.

Climate Change (All Registrants)

There is continuing world-wide attention focused on issues related to climate change. In 2015, 195 nations, including the U.S., signed the Paris Agreement on Climate, establishing non-binding targets to reduce GHG emissions from both developed and developing nations. In 2017, President Trump announced a U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, effective November 2020. In January 2021, the Biden presidential administration initiated the process to rejoin the Paris Agreement, which was completed in February 2021. The Biden administration also issued executive orders directing agencies to conduct a general review of regulations and executive actions relating to the environment and reestablished a framework for considering the social cost of carbon as part of certain agency cost-benefit analyses for new regulations. The Biden administration is exploring wide-ranging efforts to address climate change. Recent government actions and policy developments, including the President’s announced goal of a carbon free electricity sector by 2035, and targeting net-zero emissions for the federal government by 2050, could have significant impacts on PPL’s business operations, products, and services. Certain of the efforts announced by the Biden administration are preliminary or ongoing in nature. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts by various state and local governments to assess potential changes to legislation, rules, policies, directives, and other requirements applicable to greenhouse gas emissions. PPL, LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of ongoing developments.

PPL has adopted a goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, which includes continuing to retire coal-fired generation and investing in research and innovation that will help to achieve this goal, while maintaining reliable and affordable energy in our service territories. The net-zero goal relates to direct and indirect carbon emissions consistent with Greenhouse Gas Protocol guidance and referenced by the EPA Center for Corporate Climate Leadership. Through 2020, PPL has reduced carbon emissions nearly 60% from 2010 levels and is targeting a 70% reduction from 2010 levels by 2035 and an 80% reduction by 2040. 

PPL is also aware of the various risks associated with climate change, including increased frequency and severity of severe weather. To address these risks, PPL continues to work to advance the grid and improve the Company's equipment to help mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events and improve reliability.

The EPA's Affordable Clean Energy Rule (PPL, LG&E and KU)

In July 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and finalized the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule which gives states broad latitude to establish emission guidelines providing for plant-specific efficiency upgrades or "heat-rate improvements" to reduce GHG emissions per unit of electricity generated. Various entities filed petitions for review and petitions for reconsideration. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an opinion finding that the EPA had erroneously repealed the Clean Power Plan. The D.C Circuit Court's opinion also vacated and remanded the ACE Rule to the EPA. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of the D.C. Circuit Court’s ruling. PPL, LG&E, and KU cannot predict the outcome of the pending litigation and regulatory proceedings or changes that may be pursued by the Biden administration, but believe that the costs would be subject to rate recovery.

Water/Waste

(PPL, LG&E and KU)

Clean Water Act

Regulations under the federal Clean Water Act dictate permitting and mitigation requirements for facilities and construction projects that impact "Waters of the United States." Many other requirements relate to power plant operations, including the treatment of pollutants in effluents prior to discharge, the temperature of effluent discharges and the location, design and construction of cooling water intake structures at generating facilities, and standards intended to protect aquatic organisms that become trapped at or pulled through cooling water intake structures at generating facilities. These requirements could impose significant costs for LG&E and KU, which are expected to be subject to rate recovery.

11
Clean Water Act Jurisdiction

Environmental groups and others have claimed that discharges to groundwater from leaking CCR impoundments at power plants are subject to Clean Water Act permitting. On April 12, 2019, the EPA released regulatory clarification finding that Clean Water Act jurisdiction does not cover such discharges to groundwater. On January 23, 2020, the EPA announced a final rule modifying the jurisdictional scope of the Clean Water Act. The announced rule revises the definition of the "Waters of the United States," including a revision to exclude groundwater from the definition. In April 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling that Clean Water Act jurisdiction may apply to certain discharges to groundwater that result in the functional equivalent of a direct discharge to navigable waters. PPL, LG&E, and KU are unaware of any unpermitted releases from their facilities that are subject to Clean Water Act jurisdiction, but future regulatory developments and judicial rulings could potentially subject certain releases from CCR impoundments and landfills to additional permitting and remediation requirements, which could impose substantial costs. Any associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome or financial impact of future regulatory proceedings and litigation.

Waters of the United States

PPL, LG&E, and KU are subject to permitting and mitigation requirements for certain construction activities that impact “Waters of the United States.” On April 21, 2020, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a final rule revising the definition of “Waters of the United Status” to exclude jurisdiction over certain surface waters. On August 30, 2021, a U.S. District Court in Arizona vacated and remanded the rule. On December 7, 2021, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed to repeal the rule and restore the definition of “Waters of the United States” that was in place prior to 2015. On January 24, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court granted review of a case raising the issue of the appropriate scope of the definition of “Waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of current or future litigation or regulatory proceedings, but do not expect a material impact on operations.

Superfund and Other Remediation

(All Registrants)

From time to time, PPL's subsidiaries undertake testing, monitoring or remedial action in response to spills or other releases at various on-site and off-site locations, negotiate with the EPA and state and local agencies regarding actions necessary to comply with applicable requirements, negotiate with property owners and other third parties alleging impacts from PPL's operations and undertake similar actions necessary to resolve environmental matters that arise in the course of normal operations. Based on analyses to date, resolution of these environmental matters is not expected to have a significant adverse impact on the operations of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU.

Future cleanup or remediation work at sites not yet identified may result in significant additional costs for the Registrants. Insurance policies maintained by LG&E and KU may be available to cover certain of the costs or other obligations related to these matters, but the amount of insurance coverage or reimbursement cannot be estimated or assured. 

See “Legal Matters” in Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

The demand for and market prices of electricity and natural gas are affected by weather. As a result, the Registrants' operating results in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis, especially when unpredictable weather conditions make such fluctuations more pronounced. The pattern of this fluctuation may change depending on the type and location of the facilities owned. See "Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters - Air - Climate Change" for additional information.

CYBERSECURITY MANAGEMENT

The Registrants and their subsidiaries are subject to risks from cyber-attacks that have the potential to cause significant interruptions to the operation of their businesses. The frequency of these attempted intrusions has increased in recent years and the sources, motivations and techniques of attack continue to evolve and change rapidly. PPL has adopted a variety of measures to monitor and address cyber-related risks and continues to implement and explore additional cybersecurity measures. Cybersecurity and the effectiveness of PPL's cybersecurity strategy are regular topics of discussion at Board of Directors meetings. PPL's strategy for managing cyber-related risks is risk-based and, where appropriate, integrated within PPL's enterprise risk management processes. PPL's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports directly to the Chief Operating Officer, leads a dedicated cybersecurity team and is responsible for the design, implementation, and execution of cyber-risk management strategy. In addition, among other things, the CISO and the cybersecurity team actively monitor the Registrants' systems, regularly review policies, compliance, regulations and best practices, perform penetration testing, conduct incident response exercises and internal ethical phishing campaigns, and provide training and communication across the organization to strengthen secure behavior and foster a culture of security. The cybersecurity team also routinely participates in industry-wide programs to further information sharing, intelligence gathering, and unity of effort in responding to potential or actual attacks. In addition, PPL has a formal internal policy and procedures for communicating cybersecurity incidents on an enterprise-wide basis. 

In addition to these enterprise-wide initiatives, PPL's Kentucky and Pennsylvania operations are subject to extensive and rigorous mandatory cybersecurity requirements that are developed and enforced by NERC and approved by the FERC to protect grid security and reliability. LG&E is also subject to certain security directives related to cybersecurity issued by the Department of Homeland Security’s Transportation Security Administration in 2021. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on these directives. Finally, PPL purchases insurance to protect against a wide range of costs that could be incurred in connection with cyber-related incidents. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be effective to prevent interruption of services or other damage to the Registrants' businesses or operations or that PPL's insurance coverage will cover all costs incurred in connection with any cyber-related incident.
