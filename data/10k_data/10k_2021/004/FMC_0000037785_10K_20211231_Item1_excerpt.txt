ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General

FMC Corporation is a global agricultural sciences company dedicated to helping growers produce food, feed, fiber and fuel for an expanding world population while adapting to a changing environment. FMC’s innovative crop protection solutions – including biologicals, crop nutrition, digital and precision agriculture – enable growers, crop advisers and turf and pest management professionals to address their toughest challenges economically without compromising safety or the environment. FMC is committed to discovering new herbicide, insecticide and fungicide active ingredients, product formulations and pioneering technologies that are consistently better for the planet.

FMC Strategy

We have streamlined our portfolio over the past ten years to become a tier-one leader and the fifth largest global innovation provider in the agricultural chemicals market. Our strong competitive position is driven by our technology and innovation, as well as our geographic balance and crop diversity, which helped FMC to take market share in 2019, 2020, and 2021. 

Our leading fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, and biological technologies that farmers throughout the world rely on to protect their crops from disease and pests were produced at five active ingredient plants, 18 formulation and packaging sites and sold in more than 120 countries. Helping farmers grow more food sustainably on less arable land requires a continual stream of new products and technologies. We are investing in the agricultural industry’s most productive crop protection pipeline, featuring more than 25 new active ingredients in discovery, 11 new active ingredients in development, and more than 20 molecules featuring new modes of action. 

We own and operate a total of 23 manufacturing plants, and we have the scale to operate with strong resources and global reach to address changing market conditions. Our supply chain organization effectively managed to continue supplying our customers and growing our business, despite multiple shutdowns and other disruptions in the Chinese chemical sector in the last several years. As an agricultural sciences company, we are considered an "essential" industry in the countries in which we operate; we have avoided significant plant closures and all our manufacturing facilities and distribution warehouses remain operational and fully staffed. We will continue to assess the impacts of the pandemic on our business and enact commercial plans, cost savings, and/or liquidity actions as appropriate. We made significant investments in our employees as a result of the COVID pandemic, including through enhanced dependent care offerings, recognition bonuses, increased flexibility of work schedules and hours of work to accommodate remote working arrangements, and investment in IT infrastructure to promote remote work. Through these efforts we have successfully avoided any COVID related furloughs or workforce reductions to date.

Our revenues grew approximately 9 percent, or 8 percent organically(1) excluding the impacts of foreign currency, year over year in 2021, driven by strong volume growth and pricing gains in all regions. Approximately $400 million in sales for 2021 came from products launched in the last five years, representing almost 8 percent of the total revenue. In 2021, we had new product launches in Australia including Vantacor™ insect control based on Rynaxypyr® active and Overwatch® herbicide based on our Isoflex™ active. We had new product launches in North America for Xyway fungicide and Vantacor™ insect control. Products launched in 2021 accounted for approximately $120 million in sales. Our diamides, Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® active ingredients, continued to be a significant part of our portfolio, representing over $1.9 billion in combined sales and approximately 38 percent of the total revenue in 2021.We also grew our Plant Health program, which includes FMC’s Biologicals platform, by 20 percent. Plant Health is now approximately $220 million in sales and outpacing market growth.

FMC performed better than the overall crop protection market in 2021, which we estimate grew in the mid-single digit percentage range versus 2020. Foreign currency was a minor tailwind to full year revenue. As mentioned above, our growth rate was 9 percent, and excluding the impact of foreign currency, our organic(1) growth rate was 8 percent. FMC’s innovation, starting with our current portfolio of advanced products and continuing through our R&D discovery, development and new formulations, contributed to our performance. Our technology portfolio includes specific innovations in plant health, application technology and delivery systems, as well as advanced agronomic insights through Arc™ farm intelligence, our precision agriculture tool that leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

We did not have any acquisitions or divestitures in 2021. However, we continued to make investments through FMC Ventures, our venture capital arm which we formed in 2020 to target strategic investments in start-ups and early-stage companies that are developing and applying emerging technologies in the agricultural industry.

In May 2020, FMC entered into a binding offer with Isagro S.p.A ("Isagro") to acquire the remaining rights for Fluindapyr active ingredient assets from Isagro. In July 2020, we entered into an asset sale and purchase agreement with Isagro. On October 2, 2020, we closed on the transaction with a purchase price of approximately $65 million. Fluindapyr has been jointly developed by FMC and Isagro under a 2012 research and development collaboration agreement. The transaction provides FMC with full global rights to the Fluindapyr active ingredient, including key U.S., European, Asian, and Latin American fungicide markets. The transaction transferred to FMC all intellectual property, know-how, registrations, product formulations and other global assets of the proprietary broad-spectrum fungicide molecule. The acquired assets have been classified as in-process research and development. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-K for accounting considerations. The transaction has expanded our fungicide portfolio by giving us full global rights to the Fluindapyr active ingredient and is an important strategic addition to our product line. In 2022, we are launching Onsuva™ fungicide which is based on the Fluindapyr active in Argentina and Paraguay. Onsuva™ fungicide targets diseases in soy and peanut crops.

In 2019, we completed the separation of our FMC Lithium segment, which was renamed Livent Corporation, or "Livent", following its initial public offering ("IPO") that closed on October 15, 2018. After completion of the IPO, FMC owned 123 million shares of Livent's common stock, representing approximately 84 percent of the total outstanding shares of Livent's common stock. On March 1, 2019, we completed the distribution of 123 million shares of common stock of Livent as a pro rata dividend on shares of FMC. The relevant 2019 financial information within this filing has been recast to present the former FMC Lithium as a discontinued operation retrospectively for periods until its disposition on March 1, 2019.

Products and Markets

Our portfolio is comprised of three major pesticide categories: insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. The majority of our product lines consist of insecticides and herbicides, and we have a small but fast-growing portfolio of fungicides mainly used in high value crop segments. Our insecticides are used to control a wide spectrum of pests, while our herbicide portfolio primarily targets a large variety of difficult-to-control weeds. In addition, we are also investing substantially in our Plant Health program which includes biological crop protection products, seed treatments and micro-nutrients. Biological technologies developed by FMC’s R&D team in Denmark offer excellent sustainability profiles and serve as strong complements to our synthetic products. Our biologicals feature attributes that exceed the competition, such as high stability, long shelf life, low use rates and compatibility with other chemistries.

We have our own sales and marketing organizations and access the market through a combination of distributors, retailers and co-ops in all four regions. In addition, we sell directly to large growers in select countries such as Brazil. Through these and other alliances, along with our own targeted marketing efforts, access to novel technologies and our innovation initiatives, we expect to maintain and enhance our access in key agricultural and non-crop markets and develop new products that will help us continue to compete effectively.

Industry Overview 

The three principal categories of agricultural and non-crop chemicals are: herbicides, insecticides and fungicides, representing approximately 40 percent, 30 percent and 27 percent of global industry revenue, respectively.

The agrochemicals industry is more consolidated following several recent mergers of the leading crop protection companies, which now include FMC, ChemChina (owner of Syngenta Group, which includes the former Syngenta and Adama), Bayer AG (acquired Monsanto in 2018), BASF AG and Corteva Agriscience (the agricultural division of former DowDuPont, spun out in June 2019). These five innovation companies currently represent approximately 75 percent of the crop protection industry’s global sales. The next group of agrochemical producers include UPL Ltd. (UPL also acquired Arysta in February 2019), Sumitomo Chemical Company Ltd., and Nufarm Ltd. FMC employs various differentiated strategies and competes with unique technologies focusing on certain crops, markets and geographies, while also being supported by a low-cost manufacturing model.

Growth

We are among the leading agrochemical producers in the world. Several products from our portfolio are based on patent-protected active ingredients and continue to grow well above market patterns. Our complementary technologies combine improved formulation capabilities and a broader innovation pipeline, resulting in new and differentiated products. We will take advantage of enhanced market access positions and an expanded portfolio to deliver near-term growth.

We will continue to grow by obtaining new and approved uses for existing product lines and acquiring, accessing, developing, marketing, distributing and/or selling complementary chemistries and related technologies in order to strengthen our product portfolio and our capabilities to effectively service our target markets and customers.

Our growth efforts focus on developing environmentally compatible and sustainable solutions that can effectively increase farmers’ yields and provide cost-effective alternatives to chemistries which may be prone to resistance. We are committed to providing unique, differentiated products to our customers by acquiring and further developing technologies as well as investing in innovation to extend product life cycles. Our external growth efforts include product acquisitions, in-licensing of chemistries and technologies and alliances that bolster our market access, complement our existing product portfolio or provide entry into adjacent spaces. We have entered into a range of development and distribution agreements with other companies that provide access to new technologies and products which we can subsequently commercialize.

In FMC Precision Agriculture, we are broadening our award-winning Arc™ farm intelligence platform, a proprietary mobile solution that helps farmers better understand and manage pest pressure through predictive modeling based on real-time and historical data, entomological models, hyper-local weather information and in-field sensors. Arc™ farm intelligence, which is now available in more than 25 markets covering 16 million acres throughout Latin America, North America, Europe and Asia, allows farmers to address pest pressure more efficiently, manage infestations before they escalate and target applications in a more sustainable manner. 

Our venture capital arm, FMC Ventures, continued to build its portfolio in 2021 with new collaborations or strategic investments in start-ups and early stage companies working on new or disruptive technologies. These engagements, which support or augment our internal capabilities, span several important technology segments, including robotics, pathogen detection, soil health, peptides and pheromones.

Diamide Growth Strategy

Our product portfolio features two key diamide-class molecules – Rynaxypyr® (chlorantraniliprole) and Cyazypyr® (cyantraniliprole) actives – with combined annual revenues of approximately $1.9 billion in 2021. These two molecules are industry-leading in terms of performance, combining highly effective low dose rates with fast-acting, systemic, long residual control. These attributes quickly established Rynaxypyr® active as the world’s leading insect control technology and we expect it to continue on a strong growth trajectory notwithstanding the expiration of composition of matter patents covering Rynaxypyr® active in certain countries starting in late 2022. Our Cyazypyr® active, a second-generation diamide, is growing quickly as we obtain more product registrations. We expect Cyazypyr® active to continue to grow strongly notwithstanding the expiration of its active ingredient composition of matter patents starting in the mid-2020s. This expectation is based on not only our broad patent estate and the timing of key patent milestones, but also on other critical elements that will allow FMC to continue to profitably grow the diamide franchise well beyond the expiration of key patents. Some of the critical elements supporting diamide growth include registration and data protection, commercial strategies, brand recognition, as well as manufacturing and supply chain complexity and FMC efficiencies. 

Patents and Trade Secrets. The FMC diamide insect control patent estate is made up of many different patent families which cover: Composition of matter – both active ingredients and certain intermediates; Manufacturing processes – both active ingredients and certain intermediates; Formulations; Uses; and Applications. For Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® actives related patents, as of December 31, 2021, we had 34 families with granted patents filed in up to 76 countries, with a total of 857 active granted patents as well as numerous pending patent applications. See "Patents, Trademarks and Licenses" within this Item 1 for more details. FMC’s process patents cover the manufacturing processes for both active ingredients – chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole – as well as key intermediates that are used to make the final products. Chlorantraniliprole is a complex molecule to produce, requiring 16 separate steps; FMC owns granted patents covering many of these 16 process steps and several of the intermediate chemicals, and we protect other aspects of the manufacturing processes by trade secret. Cyantraniliprole is similarly complex and covered by a comparable range of intellectual property. Many of these intermediate process patents run well past the expiration of the composition of matter patents, and in some cases stretch until the end of this decade. Third parties that intend to manufacture and sell generic chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole and rely on FMC’s extensive product safety data will be required to demonstrate that their product has the same regulatory safety profile as FMC's Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® actives. To meet regulatory requirements for such difficult-to-manufacture molecules, we believe that third parties will have to produce these active ingredients using the same processes that are patented by FMC and if so, would be infringing before patent expiration and subject to our challenge for infringement. FMC also owns formulation patents which cover the use of chlorantraniliprole or cyantraniliprole in specific formulations found in commercially important end-use products. 

Regulatory Data Protection. In addition to the patent estate, various pesticide laws and regulations around the world offer added protection to the initial active ingredient registrant in the form of data protection that can extend after the composition or process patents have expired. These rules can effectively provide a product innovator and initial active ingredient registrant such as FMC with a further period of exclusive use of the key reference data even after the applicable active ingredient composition of matter patents have expired. Further, in certain countries, even after the period of exclusive use has expired, a generic entrant seeking to rely on the initial registrant’s reference data may have to pay significant compensation to the initial registrant. For FMC’s diamide products, such rights apply in key markets including United States and the European Union. 

Growing the FMC Diamide Franchise. FMC is executing a strategy to supply end-use products containing Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® actives to a broad range of companies prior to patent expiration, and in return establishing long-term purchase commitments from these companies. These arrangements may also include limited patent, data and/or trademark licenses. Such partner relationships allow us to grow our business by having others develop and sell diamide-based products to meet farmers' needs not within our current portfolio, offering those farmers a better alternative to competing insecticides with product safety or efficacy profiles which are less attractive than Rynaxypyr® or Cyazypyr® actives. These agreements can require the third-party to use the well-known and trusted Rynaxypyr® or Cyazypyr® brand names on the end-use products formulated with active ingredient supplied by FMC. As of December 31, 2021, we had global agreements with five major multinational companies and approximately 50 separate local-country agreements covering 14 countries. We are continuing to explore opportunities with additional companies beyond those with whom we are already engaged. Furthermore, FMC is developing an extensive portfolio of new diamide-containing products to address grower needs around the world. The first of these products, Elevest® and Vantacor®, were launched in the US in late 2020 and early 2021 and will be launched in additional countries in 2022 onward. Our current diamide pipeline contains approximately 20 new products to be launched this decade and we continue to explore further innovations based on the diamide chemistry.

8
Complexity of manufacturing. Today FMC manufactures all the required intermediates in the multi-step processes, as well as the final Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® actives, at our own active ingredient manufacturing plants or through key contract manufacturers who produce under long-term exclusive technology-license agreements. For a third-party to replicate this complex supply chain and manufacturing network would be a major undertaking with very large capital requirements. In addition, given our manufacturing know-how, scale of our operations, and continual investment in manufacturing process improvement, we believe FMC’s manufacturing costs will be substantially lower than any other party seeking to produce these diamide products. 

Collectively, these four factors – deep patent estate, proprietary regulatory data, strong commercial approach leveraging our brand recognition, and capabilities of managing large scale manufacturing complexity – provide us the basis for our expectation that FMC will be the company of choice to supply chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole products to third-party partners, and ultimately to farmers, well into the future. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

We utilize numerous vendors to supply raw materials and intermediate chemicals to support operations. These materials are sourced on a global basis to strategically balance FMC’s vendor portfolio. 

Patents, Trademarks and Licenses

As an agricultural sciences company, FMC believes in innovation and in protecting that innovation through intellectual property rights. We own and license a significant number of U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property that are cumulatively important to our business. In addition, we seek to license our proprietary technologies through partnering arrangements that effectively allow us to capitalize from our intellectual property. The FMC intellectual property estate provides us with a significant competitive advantage which we seek to expand and renew on a continual basis. We manage our technology investment to discover and develop new active ingredients and biological products, as well as to continue to improve manufacturing processes and existing active ingredients through new formulations, mixtures or other concepts. FMC’s technology innovation processes capture those innovations and protect them through the most appropriate form of intellectual property rights. We also in-license certain active ingredients and other technologies under patents held by third parties, and have granted licenses to certain of our patents to third parties. 

Our patents cover many aspects of our business, including our chemical and biological active ingredients, intermediate chemicals, manufacturing processes to produce such active ingredients or intermediates, formulations, and product uses, as well as many aspects of our research and development activities that support the FMC new product pipeline. Patents are granted by individual jurisdictions and the duration of our patents depends on their respective jurisdictions and payment of annuities.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned a total of approximately 200 active granted U.S. patents and 2,600 active granted foreign patents (includes Supplemental Patent Certificates); we also have approximately 1,700 patent applications pending globally.

In our current product portfolio, our diamide insect control products based on Rynaxypyr® (Chlorantraniliprole) and Cyazypyr® (Cyantraniliprole) active ingredients have a substantial patent estate which will remain in force well into the future. More details regarding our diamide granted patent estate are set forth in the tables below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*Patent families were only placed under one type but may cover several types.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

9
We also own many trademarks that are well recognized by customers or product end-users. Unlike patents, ownership rights in trademarks can be continued indefinitely so long as the trademarks are properly used and renewal fees are paid. 

We actively monitor and manage our patents and trademarks to maintain our rights in these assets and we strategically take aggressive action when we believe our intellectual property rights are being infringed. During 2021, we initiated proceedings to enforce several of our patents and trademarks against generic producers and infringers, resulting in multiple favorable judgments and settlements, including in India and China. In early 2022, we received notice that certain third parties are seeking to invalidate our Chinese patents on a certain intermediate involved in producing chlorantraniliprole and a process to produce chlorantraniliprole; we intend to defend vigorously the validity of both patents. While we believe that the invalidity or loss of any particular patent, trademark or license would be a remote possibility, our patent and trademark estate related to our diamide insect control products based on Rynaxypyr® and Cyazypyr® active ingredients in the aggregate are of material importance to our operations.

Seasonality

The seasonal nature of the crop protection market and the geographic spread of our business can result in significant variations in quarterly earnings among geographic locations. Our products sold in the northern hemisphere (North America, Europe and parts of Asia) serve seasonal agricultural markets from March through September, generally resulting in significant earnings in the first and second quarters, and to a lesser extent in the fourth quarter. Markets in the southern hemisphere (Latin America and parts of the Asia Pacific region, including Australia) are served from July through February, generally resulting in earnings in the third, fourth and first quarters. 

Competition

We encounter substantial competition in our business. We market our products through our own sales organization and through alliance partners, independent distributors and sales representatives. The number of our principal competitors varies from market to market. In general, we compete by providing advanced technology, high product quality, reliability, quality customer and technical service, and by operating in a cost-efficient manner.

Our business competes primarily in the global chemical crop protection market for insecticides, herbicides and fungicides. Industry products include crop protection chemicals and biologicals, for certain major competitors, genetically engineered (crop biotechnology) products. Competition from generic agrochemical producers is significant as a number of key product patents have expired in the last two decades. In general, we compete as an innovator by focusing on product development, including novel formulations, proprietary mixes, and advanced delivery systems and by acquiring or licensing (mostly) proprietary chemistries or technologies that complement our product and geographic focus. We also differentiate ourselves by our global cost-competitiveness through our manufacturing strategies, establishing effective product stewardship programs and developing strategic alliances that strengthen market access in key countries and regions.

Research and Development Expense

The R&D efforts in our business focus on discovering and developing environmentally sound solutions — both new active ingredients and new product formulations — that meet the needs of farmers to maximize yields and control pests. On June 24, 2019, we announced our investment of more than $50 million at our FMC Stine Research Center in Newark, Delaware, to upgrade infrastructure and complete construction on a new, state-of-the-art greenhouse and laboratory facility. We anticipate that the project will be completed by the end of 2023. 

Environmental Laws and Regulations

A discussion of environmental related factors can be found in Item 7 "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 12 "Environmental Obligations" in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.

Human Capital

Employees

We employ approximately 6,400 people with about 1,400 people in our domestic operations and 5,000 people in our foreign operations. 

Approximately 3 percent of our U.S.-based and 34 percent of our foreign-based employees, respectively, are represented by collective bargaining agreements. We have successfully concluded most of our recent contract negotiations without any material work stoppages. In those rare instances where a work stoppage has occurred, there has been no material effect on consolidated sales and earnings. We cannot predict, however, the outcome of future contract negotiations. In 2022, seven foreign collective-bargaining agreements will be expiring. These contracts affect approximately 23 percent of our foreign-based employees. There are no U.S. collective-bargaining agreements expiring in 2022. 

10
Talent Engagement and Retention

At FMC, it is important that we focus our programs and initiatives on sustaining strong leaders who are committed to engaging and developing their employees, so they can lead competitively, innovate change, improve business performance, and successfully maintain a competitive advantage. FMC’s leadership development program components include in-class and self-paced learning, development planning and stretch assignments, project-based action learning and rotational learning, mentoring and coaching, and leadership and functional assessments. Our programs are designed to provide engaging, collaborative, and creative learning environments. Employees leverage their experiences in these programs to develop their leadership abilities to their highest levels, enabling them to deliver innovative solutions, strong results and continued growth. Three of our signature leadership programs are science of leadership, the art of leadership, and keys to leadership. We hold quarterly Town Hall meetings and engage with our employees continuously through regular email updates, social media, webcasts, and other channels. We ask our employees to complete surveys and participate in focus groups, we distribute certain reports to keep our employees informed, we require our employees to complete specific trainings and we are piloting a voluntary e-learning program with other development and learning opportunities. We also reach out to new talent through social media. 

FMC continually strives to meet the needs of our employees, shareholders, and customers through competitive rewards, policies, and practices that support the company as an employer of choice in every market where we compete for talent. FMC compensates employees through total reward programs that are aligned with performance and competencies. Performance-based direct pay programs include competitive base pay, annual bonus opportunities, sales incentive plans, and long-term incentives. These compensation elements along with benefits, work-life flexibility, recognition awards, talent and career development, enable FMC to offer a comprehensive total reward package designed for employees throughout their career. The following were initially offered to employees at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic to better support our employees and their families and are still currently in place:

•Fully covering the costs of COVID testing and vaccines 

•Enhancing Employee Assistance Program presentations and offerings to assist employees with mental well being

•Flexible work opportunities

Culture and Inclusion

We strive to be an inclusive company where our employees reflect the community, are valued, find purpose in their work, grow and contribute to their fullest potential. We are building on our efforts to prioritize Diversity and Inclusion, ensuring our focus remains to create opportunities, remove barriers and implement meaningful programs and actions that build an inclusive workplace. We launched two task forces, one on Social Justice and Racial Equity, and the other focused on Gender Equity. Our goal for 2027 is to have Black/African American representation in our U.S. workforce to be 14 percent and female representation to be 50 percent of our global workforce across all regions and job levels. We established new Diversity and Inclusion goals in 2021. We continue to enhance our hiring, onboarding, and employee retention practices to help us achieve these goals as well as expanded onboarding efforts to support retention of U.S. Black/African American employees. We have made progress toward our representation goals in 2021, with notable FMC firsts including the first female salesperson in Pakistan, first female field technicians in the Philippines and first female production leader and quality manager in Brazil and India, respectively. Due to our diversity and inclusion strategy, women in senior management positions increased from 34 percent in 2020 to 37 percent in 2021, including the appointment of two female executive officers in 2021. Diverse views, backgrounds and experiences are key to our success. FMC has an active global framework of Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs") with more than twenty employee resource group chapters. ERGs are regionally implemented via Regional Inclusion Councils that host events and programs to celebrate diversity and partner with the Global Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Office and other stakeholders to address diversity, equity and inclusion needs in the region. FMC scored 100 percent for a third consecutive year on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2022 Corporate Equality Index, a U.S. benchmarking survey measuring corporate policies and practices related to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer ("LGBTQ") workplace equality. We recognize building an inclusive workplace is a journey and believe diverse views, backgrounds and experiences remain keys to FMC’s success.

Safety 

Safety is a core value of FMC. At FMC, people come first. We strive for an injury-free workplace, where every person returns home the same way they arrived. We encourage a culture of open reporting, to learn from our mistakes and work towards continuous improvement in behaviors and processes. As a result of our firm commitment to safety, our 2021 TRIR of 0.0662 continues to be among the lowest in the industry globally and in the upper decile of peer companies in North America, placing our company among the safest organizations in the chemical industry. This milestone underscores our collective commitment to work safely every day. We empower our people to always put safety first. 2021 continued to challenge us with issues related to the COVID pandemic ranging from staffing to supply chain constraints. FMC responded by collaborating across functions and continuing to utilize our robust Business Continuity Plans ("BCPs") to ensure continued safe operation at all of our manufacturing sites. These BCPs continue to be highly effective, resulting in zero FMC on-site transmissions of the virus during 2021. In 2022, we continue our journey, focusing on improving management systems and tools. These BCPs proved to 

11
be highly effective at mitigating business or operational disruptions, even during peak periods of the pandemic. In addition, we continue to engage our global workforce through focused campaigns which address issues and trends identified through analysis of our environment, health and safety data.

Sustainability

We are committed to delivering products that maintain a safe and secure food supply and to do so in a way that protects the environment for future generations. To reflect this commitment, we reset our sustainability goals in October 2019 to challenge ourselves and ensure that we are helping to create a better world. Our goals include achieving (i) 100 percent research and development spend on developing sustainable products by 2025, (ii) <0.1 Total Recordable Incident Rate ("TRIR") by 2025, (iii) a 25 percent reduction in Energy Intensity by 2030, (iv) a 25 percent reduction in Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") emissions intensity by 2030, (v) a 20 percent reduction in Water-Use Intensity in High-Risk Locations by 2030, (vi) a sustained Waste Disposed Intensity through 2030 (from our 2018 base year level), and (vii) a 100 on the Community Engagement Index by 2025. In 2021, FMC continued to make progress towards meeting its commitments on the updated goals. In addition, to build on our progress towards energy and resource reduction, in August of 2021, FMC announced its goal of net-zero GHG emissions across its entire value chain (i.e., Scopes 1, 2 and 3) by 2035. FMC committed to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi), Net-Zero Standard, in line with keeping the global temperature at 1.5°C above pre-industrial time. FMC anticipates submitting targets to SBTi in the first quarter of 2022.

FMC developed and utilizes its award-winning Sustainability Assessment Tool to determine the sustainability of new active ingredients and formulated products in the research and development pipeline. This assessment, along with other stewardship processes and tools, ensures the introduction and use of environmentally sustainable agricultural solutions. 

At FMC we promote stewardship at each stage of the product life cycle, and stewardship priorities are built into the core of research and development, portfolio and marketing strategies for a truly proactive approach. We continue to strive for open and transparent communications about our product stewardship successes and challenges. FMC is continuing to phase out Highly Hazardous Pesticides ("HHPs") from our product portfolio. In 2021, HHPs accounted for approximately 0.4 percent of our total sales.
