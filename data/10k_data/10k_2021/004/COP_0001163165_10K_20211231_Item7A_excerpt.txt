Item 7A.

 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

Financial Instrument Market Risk 

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold

 and issue derivative contracts

 and financial instruments that expose our 

cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity prices,

 foreign currency exchange

 rates or interest

 rates.

 We may 

use financial and commodity-based derivative

 contracts to manage the risks

 produced by changes in the prices of 

natural gas, crude oil and related

 products; fluctuations in interest

 rates and foreign currency

 exchange rates; or to 

capture market opportunities. 

Our use of derivative instruments

 is governed by an “Authority

 Limitations” document approved

 by our Board of 

Directors that prohibits

 the use of highly leveraged derivatives

 or derivative instruments without

 sufficient 

liquidity.

 The Authority Limitations document also establishes

 the Value at Risk (VaR)

 limits for the company,

 and 

compliance with these limits is monitored daily.

 The Executive Vice President and Chief Financial

 Officer, who 

reports to the Chief Executive

 Officer, monitors

 commodity price risk and risks resulting from

 foreign currency 

exchange rates and

 interest rates.

 The Commercial organization

 manages our commercial marketing, optimizes 

our commodity flows and positions, and monitors

 risks.

Commodity Price Risk 

Our Commercial organization

 uses futures, forwards, swaps

 and options in various markets

 to accomplish the 

following objectives: 

●

Meet customer needs.

 Consistent with our policy to generally

 remain exposed to market

 prices, we use 

swap contracts to convert

 fixed-price sales contracts, which

 are often requested by natural

 gas 

consumers, to floating market

 prices. 

●

Enable us to use market knowledge to

 capture opportunities such as moving physical

 commodities to 

more profitable locations and storing

 commodities to capture seasonal or time premiums.

 We may use 

derivatives to optimize

 these activities.

We use a VaR

 model to estimate the loss in fair

 value that could potentially result

 on a single day from the effect of 

adverse changes in market

 conditions on the derivative financial instruments

 and derivative commodity 

instruments we hold or issue, including commodity

 purchases and sales contracts

 recorded on the balance sheet at 

December 31, 2021, as derivative instruments.

 Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent

 confidence level and a 

one-day holding period, the VaR

 for those instruments issued or held for

 trading purposes or held for purposes 

other than trading at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was

 immaterial to our consolidated

 cash flows and net income 

attributable to ConocoPhillips.

Interest Rate Risk 

The following table provides information

 about our debt instruments that are

 sensitive to changes in U.S. interest 

rates.

 The table presents principal cash flows

 and related weighted-average

 interest rates

 by expected maturity 

dates.

 Weighted-average

 variable rates are based

 on effective rates

 at the reporting date.

 The carrying amount of 

our floating-rate debt approximates

 its fair value.

 A hypothetical 10 percent change in

 prevailing interest rates 

would not have a material impact

 on interest expense associated

 with our floating-rate debt.

 The fair value of the 

fixed-rate debt is measured

 using prices available from a pricing service that

 is corroborated by

 market data.

Changes to prevailing interest

 rates would not impact our cash

 flows associated with fixed rate

 debt, unless we 

elect to repurchase or retire such

 debt prior to maturity.

Foreign Currency Exchange

 Risk 

We have foreign

 currency exchange rate

 risk resulting from international

 operations.

 We do not comprehensively 

hedge the exposure to currency

 exchange rate changes

 although we may choose to selectively

 hedge certain 

foreign currency exchange

 rate exposures,

 such as firm commitments for capital

 projects or local currency tax 

payments, dividends and cash returns

 from net investments in foreign

 affiliates to be remitted

 within the coming 

year,

 and investments in equity securities. 

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held foreign

 currency exchange forwards

 hedging cross-border commercial 

activity and foreign currency exchange

 swaps for purposes of mitigating

 our cash-related exposures.

 Although 

these forwards and swaps

 hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange

 rates, we elected not to

 utilize hedge 

accounting.

 As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign

 currency exchange derivatives

 is recorded 

directly in earnings.

At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding

 foreign currency exchange

 forward contracts

 to buy $1.9 billion AUD at 

$0.715 AUD against the U.S. dollar.

 At December 31, 2020, we had outstanding

 foreign currency exchange

 forward 

contracts to sell $0.45 billion CAD at $0.748

 CAD against the U.S. dollar.

 Based on the assumed volatility in the fair 

value calculation, the net fair value

 of these foreign currency contracts

 at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 

2020, were a before-tax

 gain of $21 million and before

 -tax loss of $16 million, respectively.

 Based on an adverse 

hypothetical 10 percent change

 in the December 2021 and December 2020 exchange

 rate, this would result

 in an 

additional before-tax loss

 of $134 million and $39 million, respectively.

 The sensitivity analysis is based on 

changing one assumption while holding all other assumptions constant,

 which in practice may be unlikely

 to occur, 

as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
