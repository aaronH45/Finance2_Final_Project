PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

General

The company, which was founded in 1963 in Columbus, Ohio, has evolved over time from an apparel-based specialty retailer to a segment leader focused on home fragrance, body care products and soaps and sanitizer products operating under the Bath & Body Works, White Barn and other brand names. On August 2, 2021, the company completed the spin-off of its Victoria's Secret business, which included the Victoria's Secret and PINK brands, into an independent publicly traded company ("Victoria's Secret & Co." and such transaction, the "Separation") on a tax-free basis. Accordingly, the operating results of the Victoria's Secret business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented. All discussion within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including amounts, percentages and disclosures for all periods presented, reflect only the continuing operations of the company unless otherwise noted. In connection with the spin-off of the Victoria's Secret business, the company changed its name from L Brands, Inc. to Bath & Body Works, Inc. ("we," the "Company" or "Bath & Body Works"). Additionally, starting August 3, 2021, our common stock began trading under the stock symbol "BBWI."

We make the world a brighter, happier place through the power of fragrance. This idea is what we were founded on, and it's at the heart of everything we do. We're a team that cares about our customers and believes in giving them a reason to celebrate with fragrance every day. We remain committed to fostering a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture that is focused on delivering exceptional fragrances and experiences. We work hard to improve our communities and our planet because we believe the world is a better place whenever everyone has access to the things that make them happy. We are one of the world’s leading specialty retailers and home to America’s Favorite Fragrances® offering a breadth of exclusive fragrances for the body and home, including the number one selling collections for fine fragrance mist, body lotion and body cream, 3-wick candles, home fragrance diffusers and liquid hand soap. For more than 30 years, customers have looked to Bath & Body Works for quality, on-trend products and the newest, freshest fragrances. 

We believe we benefit from global brand awareness, a wide and compelling product assortment and a deep connection with our customers. As of January 29, 2022, our merchandise is sold through 1,755 company-operated stores and e-commerce sites in the United States of America ("U.S.") and Canada, and in 338 stores and 27 e-commerce sites in more than 35 other countries operating under franchise, license and wholesale arrangements. 

Fiscal Year

Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31. As used herein, “2021,” “2020” and “2019” refer to the 52-week periods ended January 29, 2022, January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020, respectively. 

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future growth:

Industry Leading Brands and Products

We have developed and operate a well-known, beloved and broadly appealing brand, which allows us to target markets across the economic spectrum, across demographics and across the world. Customers look to us to celebrate the season, transport them to a time and place, decorate their home, and find the perfect gift. During 2021, we grew our active customer file to over 60 million customers, an increase of 13% compared to pre-coronavirus pandemic levels. We benefit from a diverse range of customers who are loyal brand enthusiasts, with retention rates over 60% and increasing levels of average spend in 2021. 

We have developed trusted and market leading products in the body care, home fragrance, and soap and sanitizer categories. Our products are differentiated through a combination of fragrance, packaging and quality at an accessible price. We also sell products under our trusted sub brands, including White Barn and Aromatherapy.

In-Store Experience and Store Operations

We view our customers' in-store experience as an important vehicle for communicating the image of our brand. We utilize visual presentation of merchandise, in-store marketing, music and our sales associates to reinforce the image represented by our brand. Our in-store marketing is designed to convey the principal elements and personality of our brand. The store design, visual marketing and storytelling, fixtures, scents, and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a unique shopping experience. We display merchandise uniformly to ensure a consistent store experience, regardless of location. Store managers receive detailed plans designating fixture and merchandise placement to ensure coordinated execution of the Company-wide merchandising strategy. Our sales associates and managers are a central element in creating the atmosphere of the stores by providing a high level of customer service.

1
Digital Experience 

In addition to our in-store experience, we strive to create a customer-centric digital platform that integrates the digital and physical brand experience and enables convenience for the customer when desired. Our digital presence, including social media, our websites and our mobile applications, allows us to get to know our customers better and communicate with them anytime and anywhere. 

Product Development, Sourcing and Logistics

Quality and innovation are at the core of our sourcing strategy. We seek to drive efficiencies and mitigate risk through our strong technical research and prolific product development. We believe a large part of our success comes from frequent new fragrances, packaging and other product launches. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of bringing innovative and covetable products to our customers.

Our strategic vendor relationships provide deep capabilities across our product categories. Our supply base, which is predominantly located in North America, includes numerous long-standing vendor relationships. We also utilize the Beauty Park, a business park that includes several vendors in our vertically-integrated supply chain within close proximity of our Columbus, Ohio distribution centers. We believe the partnerships with our vendors help to deliver high-quality products to our customers and enable us to respond quickly to shifting consumer trends. 

We utilize Company-owned distribution centers located in the Columbus, Ohio area to support our operations. We also utilize third-party regional distribution centers located throughout North America that enable us to position inventory geographically closer to stores. Additionally, we utilize third-party operated direct channel fulfillment centers, and pop-up third-party operated fulfillment facilities throughout North America to support peak needs. Finally, we are investing in a new Company-operated fulfillment center in Columbus, Ohio to support the anticipated future growth of our online business.

Experienced and Committed Management Team

Our senior management team has a wealth of retail and business experience at Bath & Body Works, Inc. and other companies such as Ann Taylor and Loft, Banana Republic, Ross Stores, Abercrombie & Fitch, Madewell, Carter’s, Rosetta Stone, IBM, KPMG and Accenture. We believe that we have one of the most experienced management teams in retail.

Growth Strategy

Growth in existing categories

We believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on a growing market and will continue to innovate and drive the market through new forms, new fragrances and additional products. Our products are designed to be used daily and replenished frequently. Our product pipeline is full and we expect to continue to launch new fragrances and products about every four to six weeks. We believe we have opportunity for growth in our existing categories through the constant flow of new product launches, formula upgrades and packaging refreshes, which drives traffic and repeat customers. In the near term, we plan on repackaging many of our best-selling fragrances, upgrading certain of our formulas and testing various new container and vessel concepts in candles and soaps.

Growth in new or adjacent categories

We are also focused on innovation into new categories and new forms, such as recent launches of spray sanitizers and bar soaps. We see growth opportunities by leveraging current strengths into new categories such as men's and wellness products, facial skincare, hair care, home care, and adjacent cleanser, moisturizing and candle categories. Our men’s collection has been the fastest growing part of our body care assortment during 2021, and we will continue to focus on and expand the collection. Men’s antiperspirant and deodorant is currently featured in about one-third of our stores, and we plan to introduce these products to all stores in 2022. We are also testing an expanded men’s shop in a few stores, which will include an expanded men’s assortment featuring hair care, beard care, face and shave.

We are also focused on developing clean and eco-friendly products for our customers and our planet. We recently introduced recycled plastics across certain categories. By the end of 2022, we plan to have all of our plastic bottles made from a minimum of 50%, and up to 100%, of post-consumer recycled content.

Growth in direct channel

We see a significant opportunity for growth in the direct channel (also referred to as digital or e-commerce) by continuing to invest in capabilities to provide an exceptional customer experience. We are continuously improving the online experience by enhancing graphics, video and the marketing/content mix, as well as making our websites and mobile application easier to navigate. To increase speed to our customers, we upgraded the order management system and are investing in a Company-operated direct channel fulfillment center to complement the six permanent third-party operated direct channel fulfillment 

2
centers we utilize. Over time, we expect this additional fulfillment center, which will be highly automated, will support the growth of our direct channel.

We are focused on omnichannel initiatives and enhanced capabilities to engage our customers how, when and where they want, including offering buy online, pick-up in store ("BOPIS") at approximately 550 locations as of January 29, 2022. We plan to introduce BOPIS to approximately 250 additional stores in the near term. Our increased focus on mobile and application interactions will continue to provide flexibility and convenience to our customers, while creating a seamless shopping experience. Our shopping and services initiatives will continue to modernize the customer’s digital shopping experience through features like a loyalty program, shoppable mobile application and auto-replenishment. Further, with our customer at the core of our strategy, we are also increasing the personalization of our digital platforms through site experience and expanded text messaging marketing designed for our customers.

During 2021, we launched a Company-operated e-commerce website servicing our customers in Canada. In 2022, we plan to introduce our new customer loyalty program to our entire chain of U.S. stores. We have been piloting the loyalty program in select markets and have been encouraged by the results. Our loyalty members generally have higher spend and retention rates than our average customer. The program will also provide us with in-depth customer data that will enable us to market more effectively. 

Growth internationally

We believe that there is substantial opportunity for international growth. Scaling opportunities in existing markets coupled with growth in new markets set the foundation for sustained growth. We believe our fragrance portfolio allows successful olfactive distortions to local preferences. Our franchise partners are committed to greater expansion and opened 50 net new stores in 2021, bringing the total to 338 internationally as of January 29, 2022. Our partners plan to open 70 to 100 new international stores in 2022. Additionally, we expect to continue growing the digital components of our international business, including through country-specific web platforms tailored to local languages and preferences and through additional regional expansion. As of January 29, 2022, our partners operated 27 international websites, an increase of 6 from January 30, 2021.

Real Estate

Company-operated Stores

We have a diversified store portfolio in the U.S. and Canada across venue tiers and types, with approximately half of our fleet located in shopping malls and half of our fleet located off-mall. We are continuing our off-mall expansion to limit our exposure to vulnerable mall locations. As a result of our strong brand and established retail presence, we have been able to lease high-traffic locations in most retail centers in which we operate. We proactively manage our stores and adjust our investment levels based on performance. 

Our White Barn store design has delivered increased sales and profitability, with increases in sales and traffic following remodel completion. Approximately 60% of our stores were in the White Barn store design as of January 29, 2022, and we expect to remodel approximately 50% of the remaining core stores over the next two to four years.

Over time, we expect low-single digit annual increases in North American square footage, with off-mall penetration increasing. We will open new stores in emerging non-mall venues or as replacement stores for non-viable malls, while closing stores in non-viable or declining malls. During 2021, we increased our net square footage by 3% through 54 new off-mall stores and 79 remodels, partially offset by 35 store closures, principally in malls. 

We are planning approximately 150 total real estate projects in 2022, consisting of approximately 100 new off-mall stores and approximately 50 remodels to the White Barn store design, offset by about 40 to 50 mall closures, yielding expected square footage growth of approximately 6%.

Franchise, License and Wholesale Arrangements

In addition to our Company-operated stores, our products are sold at partner-operated locations and websites in more than 35 countries. Our partner-based business model allows us to own assortment, pricing architecture, promotions, store designs and real estate approval while our partners make investments as experts in local real estate, people and practices. 

Revenue recognized under franchise and license arrangements generally consists of royalties earned and recognized upon sale of merchandise by franchise and license partners to retail customers. Revenue is generally recognized under wholesale and sourcing arrangements at the time the title passes to the partner. We continue to increase the number of locations under these types of arrangements as part of our international expansion.

The following table provides the number of international stores operated by our partners as of January 29, 2022 and January 30, 2021:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our partners operated 27 websites as of January 29, 2022, compared to 21 websites as of January 30, 2021.

Additional Information

Merchandise Vendors

During 2021, we purchased merchandise from approximately 125 vendors, primarily located in North America. Our largest vendor supplied approximately 12% of our total merchandise purchases, while no other single vendor provided more than 10% of our merchandise purchases. Our five largest vendors supplied approximately 35% of our total merchandise purchases on a combined basis during 2021.

Distribution and Merchandise Inventory

Most of our merchandise is produced in the U.S. and is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio area. In addition to our Company-operated distribution centers, we also utilize third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute product throughout North America. We proactively evaluate our distribution channels to ensure we are able to provide the right product at the right place to meet or exceed our customers’ expectations. Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores, fulfillment and distribution centers to enable us to meet customer demand.

We continue to actively manage our inventory to adjust for the impacts of the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, including channel shifts and product category shifts. The current environment requires unprecedented agility, and we believe we are leveraging the speed that we have in our supply chain, our close partnerships with our suppliers and the capabilities of our sourcing, production and logistics teams to respond quickly.

Information Systems

Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems including human resources and finance. Victoria's Secret & Co. currently administers and maintains operations of existing technology and serves as the technology service provider to us under a transition services agreement we entered into in connection with the Separation ("TSA"). Initiatives to separate systems are underway and will occur over a multi-year time period.

Seasonal Business

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, typically accounts for approximately one-third of our net sales and is our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season. 

Working Capital 

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our credit facility is available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities. 

Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of tax and customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

Trademarks and Patents

Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.

Other Information

For additional information about our business, including our net sales and profits for the last three years, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Competition

The sale of home fragrance, body care products and soaps and sanitizer products is a highly competitive business with numerous competitors, including individual and chain specialty stores, department stores, online retailers and discount retailers. Brand image, presentation, marketing, design, price, service, fulfillment, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors.

Human Capital Management

Human Capital

At Bath & Body Works, our purpose goes beyond selling product. We work to make a difference in our communities and foster a safe, welcoming and empowering workplace for our thousands of associates.

The Human Capital and Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors oversees, amongst other things, the Company’s programs, policies, practices and strategies relating to culture, talent, diversity, equity and inclusion, equal employment opportunities and the Company’s executive compensation and succession plans.

Workforce Demographics

As of January 29, 2022, we employed approximately 56,900 associates, 48,100 of whom were part-time. The Company supplements resources using temporary associates during peak periods, such as the Christmas holiday season. Approximately 88% of our associates work in our stores, 3% in distribution centers and the balance work in home offices. None of our associates in the U.S. are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.

Our customer base is predominantly women, and we ensure that we reflect this in our associate population and in our Board room. As of January 29, 2022, women make up approximately 90% of our workforce and 44% of the members of our Board of Directors (the "Board"). Our Board is led by Sarah E. Nash, who served as Chair of the Board from May 2020 until February 22, 2022, when she assumed the role of Executive Chair.

Focus on Inclusion

We focus on recruiting, retaining and advancing diverse talent that reflects the customers we serve and the communities where we live and work. By continuing to encourage a workplace environment where diversity, equity and inclusion are valued, we believe we can serve our customers better, as well as attract and retain highly talented associates, suppliers and vendors of different backgrounds and experiences.

Led by our Office of Inclusion and with oversight from the Human Capital and Compensation Committee, we have built an inclusion strategy with five key pillars:

•Increase the diversity of candidate slates and hires for all roles.

•Develop, deploy and ensure completion of required diversity, equity and inclusion training at all levels to bring awareness and education to associates on diversity, equity and inclusion.

•Improve retention of diverse associates at all levels. Monitor culture changes and employee satisfaction through survey results and implement adjustments to better serve our associates.

•Increase volunteerism and giving to organizations promoting racial equity and social justice. 

•Increase spend with minority-owned vendors.

More than 97% of our associates at the director level and above have completed training on diversity, equity and inclusion which includes training on bias, equity and conscious inclusion. The training, which will be introduced to all associates throughout the Company in 2022, emphasizes both the Company’s and associates’ responsibility to build an inclusive culture and accountability for senior leaders.

In addition, we have Inclusion Resource Groups that provide opportunities for associates to connect with one another around their shared passion for creating an inclusive workplace for all associates. These groups provide professional development for associates, support the needs of the business, help shape the culture of our Company and provide engagement and volunteerism in the community. We have associates who are members of the six Inclusion Resource Groups designed for associates who identify as, or are allies of, the following groups: Hispanic and Latinx; LGBTQIA+; Black and African American; Asian and Pacific Islander; entry level and junior or early career professionals; and women. During fiscal year 2021, we hosted 70 virtual events with approximately 10,000 attendees, and our associates have volunteered over 2,000 hours of time to non-profits in the communities where our associates are based.

The Company was recognized by The Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index as a 2022 "Best Place to Work for LGBTQIA+ Equality." For the fifth year in a row, the Company received a perfect - 100% - score on the index, which rates companies on detailed criteria in the following four areas:

•Non-discrimination policies across business entities;

•Equitable benefits for LGBTQIA+ workers and their families;

•Supporting inclusive culture; and

•Corporate social responsibility.

This designation recognizes our ongoing commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion. 

Commitment to Equitable and Competitive Wages

We are committed to equal opportunity and treatment for all associates which includes equal career advancement opportunities and equitable and competitive wages. Our commitment to pay equity is evaluated by conducting periodic assessments of pay equity based on gender, race and ethnicity. In addition, we evaluate fairness of total compensation with reference to both internal and external comparisons. 

Our compensation programs are designed to link annual changes in compensation to overall Company performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. Our pay for performance philosophy includes participation of all salaried associates in the home offices and distribution centers in our short-term cash incentive compensation program. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align the associates’ financial interests with the interests of our stockholders.

Commitment to Providing Quality Benefits

We offer competitive, performance-based compensation; a company-matched savings and retirement plan; and flexible and affordable health, wellness and lifestyle benefits. Subject to certain eligibility requirements, associates can choose benefits and resources that fit their lifestyle, including, but not limited to, 14 weeks paid maternity leave, six weeks paid paternity leave, tuition reimbursement, free access to life planning services and a generous merchandise discount. 

6
During 2021, we enhanced our benefits by extending mental health benefits to include both full-time and ongoing/non-seasonal part-time associates and their household members and dependents. In addition, we expanded adoption to include surrogacy coverage, and expanded our bereavement leave time and tuition assistance benefits.

Associate Engagement and Development

We are committed to investing in all our associates. In 2021, we conducted a survey to assess associate engagement, culture, leadership communication and effectiveness, diversity and inclusion efforts, work-life balance and career development. In 2021, 89% of associates responded to the survey with an 85% favorable engagement rate. Leaders created action plans that were incorporated into their annual goals in response to input received via the survey. 

We provide diverse learning opportunities and challenging work experiences. We believe that associates can reach their career goals through multiple roles, career paths and locations. We offer a variety of enrichment experiences for those joining us as interns, new graduates, in mid-career or as a capstone to a career. Examples include:

•Development Days: Dedicated time to advance technical, creative or business skills.

•Leadership Development: Courses for associates in management positions to build critical skills and grow as effective leaders.

•Merchant-in-Training Program: Immersive program to learn the profession both on the job and from experts in the classroom.

•Onboarding: Dedicated time to learn the business and to form important relationships for mentoring and development. 

•Tuition Assistance: Reimbursement of 100% of eligible tuition expenses, up to $3,000 per calendar year. 

Safety Is Our Priority

The health and safety of our associates, customers and vendors is our highest priority. We provide safe and clean facilities, comply with all applicable workplace safety laws and have global safety policies and procedures to protect from avoidable injury. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented robust safety protocols to protect associates working in our distribution centers, stores and home offices. The vast majority of associates whose work can be done remotely are working from home. For associates who are working in our stores, offices and distribution centers, we are utilizing COVID-19 safety measures developed to align with or exceed Centers of Disease Control ("CDC") guidelines.

Code of Conduct

We have a written Code of Conduct that is based on our values and is a resource where associates can find information that defines behaviors that are acceptable and those that are not. We conduct an annual Code of Conduct compliance process which requires associates to complete a Code of Conduct disclosure and a separate training course. 

We maintain an Ethics Hotline, operated by a third-party, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week where associates may anonymously report potential instances of unethical conduct and potential violations of law or Company policies.
