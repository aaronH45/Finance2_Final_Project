Overview and Executive Summary

Agilent Technologies Inc. ("we", "Agilent" or the "company"), incorporated in Delaware in May 1999, is a global leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, providing application focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow.

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers. Our chemistries and supplies business and our remarketed instruments business moved from our Agilent CrossLab business segment to our life sciences and applied markets business segment. We also moved BioTek's service revenue and related cost of sales from our life sciences and applied markets business segment to our Agilent CrossLab business segment. We began reporting under this new structure with the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2022. Historical financial segment information has been recast to conform to this new presentation in our financial statements and accompanying notes. There was no change to our diagnostics and genomics business segment.

COVID-19 Pandemic 

Both our domestic and international operations have been and continue to be affected by the ongoing global pandemic of a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and the resulting volatility and uncertainty it has caused in the U.S. and international markets. In fiscal 2022, many businesses and countries, including the U.S., continued applying preventative and precautionary measures to mitigate the spread of the virus. 

In the latter part of our second quarter, we had to shut down our primary gas chromatography production facility and logistics center in Shanghai in compliance with lockdown measures related to COVID-19. We successfully managed the unplanned shutdown of our facility and fully recognized the revenue that was delayed from our second quarter within fiscal year 2022.

While conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic have improved in 2022 compared to 2021, the pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak, new variants and the contagiousness of these new variants, the effectiveness of health and safety measures including vaccines and therapies, government and community responses including additional lockdowns, the pace and strength of the economic recovery, supply chain pressures, delivery and installation delays due to variable access to customer sites, among others. We will continue to actively monitor the effects of the pandemic and will continue to take appropriate steps to mitigate the impacts to our employees and on our business results.

Russia-Ukraine Conflict

In response to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, at the beginning of March, we suspended sales prohibited by sanctions, halted the shipment of products to Russia with the exception of diagnostics and healthcare products and limited our in-country service to those diagnostics and healthcare customers. Subsequently, effective May 23, 2022, we ceased major operations within Russia, and as a result, we recorded an immaterial expense associated with the shutdown of operations for the three months ended April 30, 2022. For the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, sales derived from customers based in Russia represented an immaterial percentage of our total revenue. 

Term Loan Facility

On April 15, 2022, we entered into a term loan agreement with a group of financial institutions, which provided for a $600 million delayed draw term loan that will mature on April 15, 2025. As of October 31, 2022, we had $600 million borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.98 percent. Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest, at our option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans or (ii) adjusted term SOFR, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans. The term loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. We were in compliance with the covenants for the term loan during the year ended October 31, 2022.

On May 4, 2022, we used the proceeds from the term loan facility and repaid the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed. In May 2022, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $9 million in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statement of operations. In addition, $7 million of accrued interest, up to but not including the applicable redemption date, was paid. 

Actual Results

During 2022, we navigated through a challenging environment marked by supply chain and logistics pressures, high inflation, a COVID-related shutdown in China and were able to deliver strong results. Agilent's net revenue of $6,848 million in 2022 increased 8 percent when compared to 2021. Foreign currency movements for 2022 had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points when compared to 2021. Net revenue increased in all business segments, geographic regions and most key end markets. Revenue in the life sciences and applied markets business increased 9 percent in 2022 when compared to 2021.

Foreign currency movements had an overall favorable impact on revenue growth of 4 percentage points in 2021 when compared to 2020. 

Net income was $1,254 million in 2022 compared to net income of $1,210 million and $719 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net income in 2022 was impacted by higher sales volume partially offset by supply chain, logistics and inflationary pressures increasing our costs. Net income in 2021 was impacted by higher sales volume and net gains on fair value of equity securities partially offset by significant expense increases from our variable pay, share-based compensation expense and sales commissions. Net income in 2020 was impacted by revenue declines in certain of our businesses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and increased costs and expenses which included an impairment charge of $98 million related to the closure of our sequencer development program. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents balances of $1,053 million and $1,484 million, respectively. 

2019 Repurchase Program. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we repurchased and retired 5.2 million shares for $469 million under the 2019 repurchase program authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired 3.1 million shares for $365 million under this authorization. Effective February 18, 2021, the 2019 repurchase program was terminated and replaced by the 2021 repurchase program. The remaining authorization under the 2019 repurchase plan of $193 million expired on February 18, 2021.

2021 Repurchase Program. During the year ended October 31, 2021, we repurchased and retired 3.0 million shares for $423 million under the 2021 repurchase program authorization. During the year ended October 31, 2022, we repurchased and retired 8.4 million shares for $1,139 million under this authorization. As of October 31, 2022, we had remaining authorization to repurchase up to approximately $438 million of our common stock under the 2021 repurchase program.

 Dividends. During the year ended October 31, 2022, cash dividends of $0.840 per share, or $250 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2021, cash dividends of $0.776 per share, or $236 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock. During the year ended October 31, 2020, cash dividends of $0.720 per share, or $222 million were declared and paid on the company's outstanding common stock.

Table of Contents 

On November 16, 2022 we declared a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share of common stock, or approximately $66 million which will be paid on January 25, 2023 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 3, 2023. The timing and amounts of any future dividends are subject to determination and approval by our board of directors.

 Looking forward, we remain focused on improving our customers’ experience, differentiating product solutions and productivity. We expect to face continued inflationary and logistical pressures (such as longer lead times and limited sources of supply in the near term) which we will continue to mitigate through targeted pricing and various sourcing strategies. While we anticipate an increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal year 2023, we remain optimistic about our growth opportunities in all of our key end markets in fiscal year 2023.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable. Although these estimates are based on management's best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future, actual results may be different from the estimates. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially change the financial statements. Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult, subjective or complex judgments by management. Those policies are revenue recognition, inventory valuation, retirement and post-retirement plan assumptions, valuation of goodwill and purchased intangible assets and accounting for income taxes.

Revenue Recognition. We enter into contracts to sell products, services or combinations of products and services. Products may include hardware or software and services may include one-time service events or services performed over time.

We derive revenue primarily from the sale of analytical and diagnostics products and services. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer and is the unit of account under Accounting Standard Codification Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, (“ASC 606’’). Revenue is recognized when control of the promised products or services is transferred to our customers and the performance obligation is fulfilled in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to be entitled in exchange for those products or services, the transaction price. For equipment, consumables, and most software licenses, control transfers to the customer at a point in time. We use present right to payment, legal title, physical possession of the asset, and risks and rewards of ownership as indicators to determine the transfer of control to the customer. For products that transfer control over time, revenue is recognized as the performance obligation is satisfied. Product over time revenue is assessed against the following criteria: the performance creates an asset that the customer controls as the asset is created; the asset has no alternative use; and we have an enforceable right to payment. Where acceptance is not a formality, the customer must have documented their acceptance of the product or service. For products that include installation, if the installation meets the criteria to be considered a separate performance obligation, product revenue is recognized when control has passed to the customer, and recognition of installation revenue occurs once completed. Product revenue, including sales to resellers and distributors is reduced for provisions for warranties, returns, and other adjustments in the period the related sales are recorded.

Service revenue includes extended warranty, customer and software support including: Software as a Service, post contract support, consulting including companion diagnostics, and training and education. Instrument service contracts and software maintenance contracts are typically annual contracts, which are billed at the beginning of the contract or maintenance period. Revenue for these contracts is recognized on a straight-line basis to revenue over the service period, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. There are no deferred costs associated with the service contract, as the cost of the service is recorded when the service is performed. Service calls not included in a support contract are recognized to revenue at the time a service is performed. 

We have sales from standalone software. These arrangements typically include software licenses and maintenance contracts, both of which we have determined are distinct performance obligations. We determine the amount of the transaction price to allocate to the license and maintenance contract based on the relative standalone selling price of each performance obligation. Software license revenue is recognized at the point in time when control has been transferred to the customer. The revenue allocated to the software maintenance contract is recognized on a straight-line basis over the maintenance period, which is the contractual term of the contract, as a time-based measure of progress best reflects our performance in satisfying this obligation. Unspecified rights to software upgrades are typically sold as part of the maintenance contract on a when-and-if-available basis.

Table of Contents 

 Our multiple-element arrangements are generally comprised of a combination of instruments, installation or other start-up services, and/or software, and/or support or services. Hardware and software elements are typically delivered at the same time and revenue is recognized when control passes to the customer. Service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered and accepted by the customer. Our arrangements generally do not include any provisions for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact recognized revenue.

For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to each performance obligation based on relative standalone selling prices and recognize the related revenue when or as control of each individual performance obligation is transferred to customers. We estimate the standalone selling price by calculating the average historical selling price of our products and services per country for each performance obligation. Stand-alone selling prices are determined for each distinct good or service in the contract, and then we allocate the transaction price in proportion to those standalone selling prices by performance obligations.

A portion of our revenue relates to lease arrangements. Standalone lease arrangements are outside the scope of ASC 606 and are therefore accounted for in accordance with ASC 842, Leases ("ASC 842") beginning in 2020 and ASC 840, Leases ("ASC 840") for prior periods. Each of these contracts is evaluated as a lease arrangement, either as an operating lease or a sales-type finance lease using the current lease classification guidance. In a lease arrangement that is a multiple-element arrangement that contains equipment leases and the supply of consumables, the revenue associated with the instrument rental is treated under the lease accounting standard ASC 842, whereas the revenue associated with the consumables, the non-lease component, is recognized in accordance with the ASC 606 revenue standard.

Inventory Valuation. We assess the valuation of our inventory on a periodic basis and make adjustments to the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage. Such estimates are difficult to make under most economic conditions. The excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge. Our excess inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts, managing product rollovers and working with manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, additional write-downs may be required. If actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated, inventory previously written down may be sold to customers, resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period. 

Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Assumptions. Retirement and post-retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business. They represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees' average expected future service to Agilent based on the terms of the plans and investment and funding decisions. To estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations, we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Other important assumptions include expected future salary increases, expected future increases to benefit payments, expected retirement dates, employee turnover, retiree mortality rates, and portfolio composition. We evaluate these assumptions at least annually.

The discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at the measurement date - October 31 for both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. For 2022 and 2021, the U.S. discount rates were based on the results of matching expected plan benefit payments with cash flows from a hypothetically constructed bond portfolio. In 2022, discount rates for the U.S. pension and retiree medical plans increased compared to the previous year due to the increase in the corporate bond rates. For 2022 and 2021, the discount rates for non-U.S. plans were generally based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds and in 2022, increased compared to the previous year. If we had changed our discount rate by 1 percent, the impact would have been approximately $3 million on U.S. pension expense and $16 million on non-U.S. pension expense for the year ended October 31, 2022. Lower discount rates usually increase present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense; higher discount rates usually decrease present values of the pension benefit obligation and subsequent year pension expense.

The company uses alternate methods of amortization as allowed by the authoritative guidance which amortizes the actuarial gains and losses on a consistent basis for the years presented. For U.S. Plans, gains and losses are amortized over the average future lifetime of participants using the corridor method. For most Non-U.S. Plans and U.S. Post-Retirement Benefit Plans, gains and losses are amortized using a separate layer for each year's gains and losses. 

In the U.S., target asset allocations for our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans were approximately 50 percent to equities and approximately 50 percent to fixed income investments as of October 31, 2022. Our Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan 

34

Table of Contents 

target asset allocation is approximately 60 percent to equities and approximately 40 percent to fixed income investments. Approximately 1 percent of the retirement and post-retirement plans consists of limited partnerships. Outside the U.S., our target asset allocation ranges from 15 percent to 60 percent to equities, from 30 percent to 80 percent to fixed income investments, from zero to 25 percent to real estate and from zero to 55 percent to annuity contracts, depending on the plan. All plans' assets are broadly diversified. Due to fluctuations in equity and bond markets, our actual allocations of plan assets at October 31, 2022, may differ from the target allocation. Our policy is to bring the actual allocation in line with the target allocation.

Equity securities include exchange-traded common stock and preferred stock of companies from broadly diversified industries. Fixed income securities include a global portfolio of corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, government securities, mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, derivative instruments and other. The annuity contract is an insurance buy-in contract issued by a third-party insurance company for a portion of benefit obligations of listed pensioners under the U.K. defined benefit plan, and is funded with existing pension plan assets with no adjustment made to the benefit obligations. Real estate securities include holdings of managed investment funds which invest primarily in the equity instruments of real estate investment trusts and other similar real estate investments. Other investments include a group trust consisting primarily of private equity partnerships. 

The expected long-term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations as well as historical and expected returns. Plan assets are valued at fair value. If we had changed our estimated return on assets by 1 percent, the impact would have been $6 million on U.S. pension expense and $10 million on non-U.S. pension expense for the year ended October 31, 2022. The total periodic pension and post-retirement benefit costs recorded were a $2 million benefit in 2022, $24 million expense in 2021 and $22 million expense in 2020. These costs included a loss on settlement of $4 million, $1 million and $4 million, for the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets. We assess our goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Under the authoritative guidance, we have the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The accounting standard gives an entity the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether performing the quantitative test is necessary. If an entity believes, as a result of its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test will be required. Otherwise, no further testing will be required.

The guidance includes examples of events and circumstances that might indicate that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. These include macro-economic conditions such as deterioration in the entity's operating environment or industry or market considerations; entity-specific events such as increasing costs, declining financial performance, or loss of key personnel; or other events such as an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or a sustained decrease in the stock price on either an absolute basis or relative to peers.

If it is determined, as a result of the qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test on goodwill to identify and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. A goodwill impairment loss, if any, is measured as the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. As defined in the authoritative guidance, a reporting unit is an operating segment, or one level below an operating segment. We aggregate components of an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics into our reporting units. 

In fiscal year 2022, we assessed goodwill impairment for our three reporting units which consisted of our three segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics and Agilent CrossLab. We performed a quantitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units as of November 1, 2021, due to the change in our segment structure. As of November 1, 2021, there was no impairment of goodwill. We performed a qualitative test for goodwill impairment of the three reporting units, as of September 30, 2022, our annual impairment test date. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit is greater than its respective carrying value. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if goodwill impairment is indicated. There was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.

 Purchased intangible assets consist primarily of acquired developed technologies, proprietary know-how, trademarks, and customer relationships and are amortized using the best estimate of the asset's useful life that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or used up or a straight-line method ranging from 6 months to 15 years. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Specifically, our determination of the fair value of the developed product technology and in-process research and development ("IPR&D") 

35

Table of Contents 

acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates and discount rates. Our determination of the fair value of customer relationships acquired involves significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, discount rates, and customer attrition rates. Our determination of the fair value of the tradename acquired involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates and discount rates. The company believes that the fair value assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions and estimates that marketplace participants would use. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to our consolidated statement of operations in the period it is abandoned.

We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of finite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. 

Our indefinite-lived intangible assets are IPR&D intangible assets. The accounting guidance allows a qualitative approach for testing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, similar to the issued impairment testing guidance for goodwill and allows the option to first assess qualitative factors (events and circumstances) that could have affected the significant inputs used in determining the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not (i.e., greater than 50% chance) that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. An organization may choose to bypass the qualitative assessment for any indefinite-lived intangible asset in any period and proceed directly to calculating its fair value. We performed a qualitative test for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of September 30, 2022. Based on the results of our qualitative testing, we believe that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair values of these indefinite-lived intangible assets are greater than their respective carrying values. Each quarter we review the events and circumstances to determine if impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets is indicated. During the year ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 there were no impairments of indefinite-lived intangible assets. During the year ended October 31, 2020, we recorded an impairment of in-process research and development of $90 million related to the shutdown of our sequencer development program in our diagnostics and genomics segment. 

Accounting for Income Taxes. We must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period. On a quarterly basis, we provide for income taxes based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate. The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies. We monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results differ from these estimates, this could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Significant management judgment is also required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part. When it is more-likely-than-not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets may not be realized, a valuation allowance must be established against such deferred tax assets. We consider all available positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis when assessing whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable. We consider evidence such as our past operating results, the existence of losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary.

We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.

Adoption of New Pronouncements

See Note 2, "New Accounting Pronouncements," to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new accounting pronouncements.

Foreign Currency

Our revenues, costs and expenses, and monetary assets and liabilities and equity are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2022, had an overall unfavorable impact on revenue of 4 percentage points when compared to the same period last year. Foreign currency movements for the year ended October 31, 2021, had an overall favorable impact on revenue of 3 percentage points when compared to 2020. When movements in foreign currency exchange rates have a negative impact on revenue, they will also have a positive impact by reducing our costs and expenses. We calculate the impact of movements in foreign currency exchange rates by applying the actual foreign currency exchange rates in effect during the last month of each quarter of the current year to both the applicable current and prior year periods. We hedge revenues, expenses and balance sheet exposures that are not denominated in the functional currencies of our subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis. We do experience some fluctuations within individual lines of the consolidated statement of operations and balance sheet because our hedging program is not designed to offset the currency movements in each category of revenues, expenses, monetary assets and liabilities. Our hedging program is designed to hedge currency movements on a relatively short-term basis (up to a rolling thirteen-month period). We may also hedge equity balances denominated in foreign currency on a long-term basis. To the extent that we are required to pay for all, or portions, of an acquisition price in foreign currencies, we may enter into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk that currency movements will impact the U.S. dollar cost of the transaction.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2022, our income tax expense was $250 million with an effective tax rate of 16.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2022, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the tax benefit of $46 million related to foreign-derived intangible income.

For 2021, our income tax expense was $150 million with an effective tax rate of 11 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2021, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by the discrete benefit of $93 million related to the release of tax reserves in various jurisdictions due to audit settlements and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2021, also include the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $29 million.

For 2020, our income tax expense was $123 million with an effective tax rate of 14.6 percent. For the year ended October 31, 2020, our effective tax rate and the resulting provision for income taxes were impacted by foreign income taxed at lower rates.

We have negotiated a tax holiday in Singapore. The tax holiday provides a lower rate of taxation on certain classes of income and requires various thresholds of investments and employment or specific types of income. In December 2018, the tax holiday in Singapore was renegotiated and extended through 2027. As a result of the incentive, the impact of the tax holiday decreased income taxes by $53 million, $35 million, and $71 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on net income per share (diluted) was approximately $0.18, $0.11, and $0.23 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

With these jurisdictions and the U.S., it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitation or a tax audit settlement which will be partially offset by an anticipated tax liability related to unremitted foreign earnings, where applicable. Given the number of years and numerous matters that remain subject to examination in various tax jurisdictions, management is unable to estimate the range of possible changes to the balance of our unrecognized tax benefits.

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax law and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. Although the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes the use of a recognition and measurement model, the determination of whether an uncertain tax position has met those thresholds will continue to require significant judgment by management. In accordance with the guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, for all U.S. and other tax jurisdictions, we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest will be due. The ultimate resolution of tax uncertainties may differ from what is currently estimated, which could result in a material impact on income tax expense. If our estimate of income tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would be required. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of operations.

Segment Overview

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we announced a change in organizational structure designed to enable our growth strategies and strengthen our focus on customers.

Research and development expenses increased 4 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Research and 

46

development investment within the Agilent CrossLab business increased due to higher wages and a continued focus on digital service offerings.

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 3 percent in 2022 when compared to 2021.The increase was due to higher wages, share-based compensation expense and inflationary pressures mostly offset by lower commissions, variable pay, and favorable currency movements. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 13 percent in 2021 when compared to 2020. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to higher wages and variable pay, sales commissions and share-based compensation expense.

Operating margin increased 1 percentage point in 2021 when compared to 2020. Operating margin grew slightly in 2021 due to higher sales volume offset by higher wages and variable pay, higher service delivery costs and cash flow hedging losses.

Income from Operations

Income from operations in 2022 increased by $47 million or 15 percent when compared to 2021 on a revenue increase of $92 million. Income from operations increased primarily due to higher sales volume.

Financial Condition

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We believe our cash and cash equivalents, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and credit lines will satisfy, for at least the next twelve months and beyond, our liquidity requirements, both globally and domestically, including the following: working capital needs, capital expenditures, business acquisitions, stock repurchases, cash dividends, contractual obligations, commitments, principal and interest payments on debt, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations. 

Our financial position as of October 31, 2022 consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1,053 million as compared to $1,484 million as of October 31, 2021.

We may, from time to time, retire certain outstanding debt of ours through open market cash purchases, privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,312 million in 2022 as compared to $1,485 million provided in 2021 and $921 million provided in 2020. Net cash paid for income taxes was approximately $279 million in 2022 compared to income taxes paid of $211 million in 2021 and $361 million, which included a one-time payment of $231 million related to the transfer of intellectual property, in 2020. For the years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, other assets and liabilities used cash of $8 million, $14 million and $182 million, respectively. The cash outflow in the year ended October 31, 2020 was largely the result of increased income tax payments, interest payments on senior notes and changes in deferred revenue. 

In 2022, accounts receivable used cash of $321 million, compared to $128 million in 2021, and $107 million in 2020. Days' sales outstanding as of October 31, were 68 days in 2022, 64 days in 2021 and 63 days in 2020. The increase in accounts receivable related to the transitory impacts of shutdowns in China. In addition, we had a change in the mix of unbilled receivables primarily due to our nucleic acid solutions business, which has a longer cash conversion cycle. The change in accounts payable provided cash of $121 million in 2022, $64 million in 2021 and $2 million in 2020. Cash used in inventory was $248 million in 2022, $136 million in 2021 and $68 million in 2020. Inventory days on-hand increased to 112 days in 2022 compared to 98 days in 2021 and increased compared to 93 days in 2020. In the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021, we increased our inventory levels to meet our customer needs and to compensate for long lead time in ordering from our suppliers.

The employee compensation and benefits liability used cash of $22 million for the year ended October 31, 2022, compared to cash provided of $112 million in 2021 and $29 million in 2020. In 2022, the change was primarily due to higher variable and incentive payments and a reduction in the employee vacation liability compared to 2021. In 2021, the change was 

47

largely due to an increase in the vacation liability and variable and incentive pay liability compared to 2020. We paid approximately $201 million in 2022 under our variable and incentive pay programs compared to $119 million in 2021 and $79 million in 2020. 

We made no contributions to our U.S defined benefit plans in 2022, 2021 and 2020. We contributed $17 million in 2022 and $19 million in 2021 and $31 million in 2020 to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans, respectively. We did not contribute to our U.S. post-retirement benefit plans in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Our non-U.S. defined benefit plans are generally funded ratably throughout the year. The higher contribution in 2020 mainly related to $12 million additional contribution in the Netherlands. Our annual contributions are highly dependent on the relative performance of our assets versus our projected liabilities, among other factors. We do not expect to contribute to our U.S. plans and U.S. post-retirement benefit plans during 2023. We expect to contribute $16 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans during 2023.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities in 2022 was $338 million and in 2021 was $749 million as compared to net cash used of $147 million in 2020. 

Investments in property, plant and equipment were $291 million in 2022, $188 million in 2021 and $119 million in 2020. The increase in our investments in property plant and equipment is primarily due to the planned extension of our nucleic acid solutions production facility in Frederick, Colorado. Our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal year 2023 will be approximately $300 million. In 2022, we invested $52 million in a business and intangible assets, net of cash acquired for our acquisition of Polymer Standards Service and advanced artificial intelligence technology compared to $547 million primarily related to the acquisition of Resolution Bioscience in 2021 and zero in 2020. In 2022 cash used to purchase fair value investments was $13 million compared to $22 million outlay in 2021 and $20 million in 2020.

48

At any point in time, the company intends to maintain available commitments under its revolving credit facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of the commercial paper notes outstanding. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. The proceeds from issuances under the program may be used for general corporate purposes. As of October 31, 2022, we had borrowings of $35 million outstanding under our U.S. commercial paper program and had a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.54 percent. As of October 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the U.S. commercial paper program.

Loans under the term loan agreement bear interest, at our option, either at: (i) the alternate base rate, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans or (ii) adjusted term SOFR, as defined in the term loan agreement, plus the applicable margin for such loans. The term loan agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants.

On May 4, 2022, we used the proceeds from the term loan facility and repaid the $600 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 2023 senior notes. The total redemption price of approximately $609 million was computed in accordance with the terms of the 2023 senior notes as the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and unpaid interest on the notes being redeemed.

The swap arrangements were terminated on September 15, 2016 with a payment of $10 million, and we recognized this as a deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the 2026 senior notes.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Other

Our liquidity is affected by many factors, some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets. Our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world. Local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances. We do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization.

Contractual Commitments

Our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors, including fluctuations in our operating results, accounts receivable collections, inventory management, and the timing of tax and other payments. As a result, the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors.

The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations at October 31, 2022, for Agilent operations and excludes amounts recorded in our consolidated balance sheet (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commitments to Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of business, we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates. The above amounts represent the commitments under the open purchase orders with our suppliers that have not yet been received. However, our agreements with these suppliers usually provide us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our 

50

business needs prior to firm orders being placed. We expect to fulfill most of our purchase commitments for inventory within one year.

Other Purchase Commitments. We have categorized "other purchase commitments" related to contracts with professional services suppliers. Typically, we can cancel contracts with professional services suppliers without penalties. For those contracts that are not cancelable without penalties, there are termination fees and costs or commitments for continued spending that we are obligated to pay to a supplier under each contact's termination period before such contract can be cancelled. Our contractual obligations with these suppliers under "other purchase commitments" were approximately $139 million. 

Retirement Plans. Commitments under the retirement plans relate to expected contributions to be made to our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit plans and to our post-retirement medical plans for the next year only. Contributions after next year are impractical to estimate. Effective May 1, 2016 through April 30, 2022, we provided an additional transitional company contribution for certain eligible employees equal to 3 percent, 4 percent or 5 percent of an employee's annual eligible compensation due to the U.S. Retirement Plan benefits being frozen.

We had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of October 31, 2022, or October 31, 2021.

On Balance Sheet Arrangements

The following table summarizes our total contractual obligations on our October 31, 2022 balance sheet (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other long-term liabilities as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021 include $216 million and $241 million, respectively, related to long-term income tax liabilities. Of these amounts, $99 million and $117 million related to uncertain tax positions as of October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. We are unable to accurately predict when these amounts will be realized or released. However, it is reasonably possible that there could be significant changes to our unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months due to either the expiration of a statute of limitations or a tax audit settlement. As of October 31, 2022, the remaining $117 million included in other long-term liabilities relates to the U.S. transition tax payment which is due in installments over the next four years.
