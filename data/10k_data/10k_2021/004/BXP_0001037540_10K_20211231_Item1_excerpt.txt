PART I 

Item 1. Business

General

BXP, a Delaware corporation, is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, and is one of the largest publicly-traded office REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2021) in the United States that develops, owns and manages primarily Class A office properties. BXP was formed in 1997 to succeed the real estate development, redevelopment, acquisition, management, operating and leasing businesses associated with the predecessor company founded by Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde in 1970.

Our properties are concentrated in six markets—Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. At December 31, 2021, we owned or had joint venture interests in a portfolio of 201 commercial real estate properties, aggregating approximately 52.8 million net rentable square feet of primarily Class A office properties, including nine properties under construction/redevelopment totaling approximately 3.4 million net rentable square feet. As of December 31, 2021, our properties consisted of:

•182 office properties (including nine properties under construction/redevelopment);

•12 retail properties;

•six residential properties; and

•one hotel.

We consider Class A office properties to be well-located buildings that are modern structures or have been modernized to compete with newer buildings and professionally managed and maintained. As such, these properties attract high-quality tenants and command upper-tier rental rates. Our definition of Class A office properties may be different than those used by other companies.

We are a full-service real estate company, with substantial in-house expertise and resources in acquisitions, development, financing, capital markets, construction management, property management, marketing, leasing, accounting, risk management, tax and legal services. BXP manages BPLP as its sole general partner. Our principal executive office and Boston regional office are located at The Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199 and our telephone number is (617) 236-3300. In addition, we have regional offices at 2800 28th Street, Suite 170, Santa Monica, California 90405, 599 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022, Four Embarcadero Center, San Francisco, California 94111, 1001 Fourth Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98154 and 2200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20037.

You may also obtain BXP’s and BPLP’s reports by accessing the EDGAR database at the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov, or we will furnish an electronic or paper copy of these reports free of charge upon written request to: Investor Relations, Boston Properties, Inc., Prudential Center, 800 Boylston Street, Suite 1900, Boston, Massachusetts 02199. “Boston Properties” is a registered trademark and the “bxp” logo is a trademark, in both cases, owned by BPLP.

Boston Properties Limited Partnership

BPLP is a Delaware limited partnership organized in 1997, and the entity through which BXP conducts substantially all of its business and owns, either directly or through subsidiaries, substantially all of its assets. BXP is the sole general partner of BPLP and, as of February 14, 2022, the owner of approximately 89.6% of the economic interests in BPLP. Economic interest was calculated as the number of common partnership units of BPLP owned by BXP as a percentage of the sum of (1) the actual aggregate number of outstanding common partnership units of BPLP and (2) the number of common units issuable upon conversion of all outstanding long term incentive plan units of BPLP, or LTIP Units, for which all performance conditions have been satisfied for such conversion. We exclude from (1) and (2) above other LTIP Units issued in the form of Multi-Year Long-Term Incentive Plan Awards in 2020 or later (“MYLTIP Awards”), which remain subject to performance conditions. An LTIP Unit is generally the economic equivalent of a share of BXP’s restricted common stock, although LTIP Units issued in the form of MYLTIP Awards are only entitled to receive one-tenth (1/10th) of the regular quarterly distributions (and no special distributions) prior to being earned.

Transactions During 2021 

Acquisitions

On June 2, 2021, we acquired 153 & 211 Second Avenue located in Waltham, Massachusetts for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $100.2 million in cash. 153 & 211 Second Avenue consists of two life sciences lab buildings totaling approximately 137,000 net rentable square feet. The properties are 100% leased. 

On August 2, 2021, we acquired Shady Grove Innovation District in Rockville, Maryland, for a purchase price, including transaction costs, of approximately $118.5 million in cash. Shady Grove Innovation District is an approximately 435,000 net rentable square foot, seven-building office park situated on an approximately 31-acre site. We intend to reposition three of the buildings, which are currently vacant, to support lab or life sciences uses. As a result, the three vacant buildings are not part of our in-service portfolio. We anticipate that we will redevelop or convert the remaining four buildings to lab or life sciences-related uses as each becomes vacant.

On December 14, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 360 Park Avenue South, an approximately 450,000 square-foot, 20-story Class A office property located in the Midtown South submarket of Manhattan. The gross purchase price, including transaction costs, was approximately $300.7 million and consisted of (1) the assumption of approximately $200.3 million of mortgage debt collateralized by the property and (2) the issuance of approximately 866,503 common units of limited partnership interest in BPLP (“OP Units”). The OP Units issued totaled approximately $99.7 million based on the average closing price per share of BXP common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding the closing date. Following the acquisition, on December 14, 2021, we refinanced the mortgage loan with a new lender. The new mortgage loan totals $220.0 million (See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). On December 15, 2021, we entered into a joint venture with two institutional partners, as part of our Strategic Capital Program (“SCP”), and contributed the property and related loan for our aggregate (direct and indirect) 42.21% ownership interest in the joint venture (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The joint venture has commenced redevelopment activity. 

Pending Acquisition

On April 19, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire 11251 Roger Bacon Drive, in Reston, Virginia, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $5.6 million. The closing is scheduled to occur in the first or second quarter of 2022. 11251 Roger Bacon Drive is an approximately 65,000 square foot office building situated on approximately 2.6 acres. The property is 100% leased to a single tenant with a lease that expires concurrently with the planned closing. There can be no assurance that this transaction will be consummated on the terms currently contemplated or at all. 

Dispositions

For information explaining why BXP and BPLP may report different gains on sales of real estate, see the Explanatory Note that follows the cover page of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

On December 13, 2018, we sold our 6595 Springfield Center Drive development project located in Springfield, Virginia. Concurrently with the sale, we agreed to act as development manager and guaranteed the completion of the project (See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The development project achieved final completion during the third quarter of 2021. The total cost of development was determined to be below the estimated total investment at the time of sale. As a result, we recognized a gain on sale of real estate of approximately $8.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.

On October 25, 2021, we completed the sale of our 181,191 and 201 Spring Street properties located in Lexington, Massachusetts for an aggregate gross sales price of $191.5 million. Net cash proceeds totaled approximately $179.9 million, resulting in a gain on sale of real estate totaling approximately $115.6 million for BXP and approximately $117.1 million for BPLP. 181,191 and 201 Spring Street are three Class A office properties aggregating approximately 333,000 net rentable square feet. 

Developments/Redevelopments

As of December 31, 2021, we had nine office properties under construction/redevelopment, which we expect will total approximately 3.4 million net rentable square feet. We estimate our share of the total investment to complete these projects, in the aggregate, is approximately $2.5 billion, of which approximately $1.1 billion remains to be invested as of December 31, 2021. Approximately 59% of the commercial space in these development projects was pre-leased as of February 14, 2022. For a detailed list of the properties under construction/

On April 16, 2021, we removed 3625-3635 Peterson Way from our in-service portfolio following the lease expiration of the last tenant on April 15, 2021. Subsequently, we demolished the building and expect to redevelop the site at a future date. 3625-3635 Peterson Way was an approximately 218,000 net rentable square foot Class A office building located in Santa Clara, California. 

On October 19, 2021, we partially placed in-service Reston Next, a Class A office project with approximately 1.1 million net rentable square feet located in Reston, Virginia.

On December 8, 2021, we commenced the development of 103 CityPoint, located in Waltham, Massachusetts. When completed, the building will consist of approximately 113,000 net rentable square feet of life sciences space.

Ground Lease

On May 19, 2021, we amended the ground lease at Sumner Square in Washington, DC to extend the term for an additional 15 years. Prior to the amendment, the ground lease was scheduled to expire on August 10, 2066. The ground lease will now expire on August 9, 2081. The amended lease required us to pay $23.0 million of rent in 2021 and requires our remaining obligation of approximately $4.0 million be used to fund certain operation and maintenance costs incurred by the government with respect to the Sumner School for the next five years, with no payments thereafter. We continue to classify this ground lease as an operating lease. On July 1, 2021, we made the $23.0 million payment. Sumner Square is an approximately 210,000 net rentable square foot Class A office building.

Mortgage Notes

On March 26, 2021, we used available cash to repay the mortgage loan collateralized by our University Place property located in Cambridge, Massachusetts totaling approximately $0.9 million. The mortgage loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.94% per annum and was scheduled to mature on August 1, 2021. There was no prepayment penalty. 

On December 10, 2021, the consolidated entity in which we have a 55% interest refinanced the mortgage loan collateralized by its 601 Lexington Avenue property located in New York City with a new lender. The mortgage loan has a principal amount of $1.0 billion, requires interest-only payments at a fixed interest rate of 2.79% per annum and matures on January 9, 2032. The previous mortgage loan had an outstanding balance of approximately $616.1 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 4.75% per annum and was scheduled to mature on April 10, 2022. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the previous mortgage loan. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.1 million due to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.

On December 14, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 360 Park Avenue South, located in the Midtown South submarket of Manhattan. The gross purchase price, including transaction costs, was approximately $300.7 million and consisted of (1) the assumption of approximately $200.3 million of mortgage debt collateralized by the property and (2) the issuance of approximately 866,503 OP Units (see “Acquisitions” above). Following the acquisition, on December 14, 2021, we refinanced the mortgage loan with a new lender. The new mortgage loan totaling $220.0 million, of which $202.0 million was advanced at closing, bears interest at a variable rate equal to the Adjusted Term SOFR plus 2.40% per annum and matures on December 14, 2024 with two, one-year extension options, subject to certain conditions. The spread on the variable rate may be reduced, subject to certain conditions. The loan proceeds were used to prepay the previous mortgage loan, which had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $200.3 million, bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.044% per annum and was scheduled to mature on March 1, 2022. There was no prepayment penalty associated with the repayment of the mortgage loan. On December 15, 2021, we entered into a joint venture with two institutional partners as part of our SCP and contributed the property and related loan for our aggregate (direct and indirect) 42.21% ownership interest in the joint venture (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

The redemption price was approximately $858.7 million, which was equal to the stated principal plus approximately $8.7 million of accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the redemption date. Excluding the accrued and unpaid interest, the redemption price was equal to the principal amount being redeemed. We recognized a loss from early extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $0.4 million related to unamortized origination costs. 

On March 16, 2021, BPLP completed a public offering of $850.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 2.550% unsecured senior notes due 2032. The notes were priced at 99.570% of the principal amount to yield an effective rate (including financing fees) of approximately 2.671% per annum to maturity. The notes will mature on April 1, 2032, unless earlier redeemed. The aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately $839.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and transaction expenses.

Upon the formation of the joint venture in 2020, we had an approximately 55% ownership interest in the joint venture as a result of the partner’s deferred contribution and the partner is obligated to fund all required capital until such time as we own a 50% interest. On December 31, 2021, we had a 50% interest in the joint venture. In accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement, we expect we will have a 49% interest in this property.

On March 30, 2021, we completed the sale of our 50% ownership interest in Annapolis Junction NFM LLC (the “Annapolis Junction Joint Venture”) to the joint venture partner for a gross sales price of $65.9 million. Net cash proceeds to us totaled approximately $17.8 million after repayment of our share of debt totaling approximately $15.1 million. We recognized a gain on sale of investment totaling approximately $10.3 million, which is included in Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated Joint Ventures in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. In addition to net cash proceeds from the sale, we received a distribution of approximately $5.8 million of available cash.

On September 1, 2021, we entered into a joint venture to acquire Safeco Plaza, a Class A office property located in Seattle, Washington, for a net purchase price of approximately $460.1 million, including $4.9 million of seller funded leasing and capital costs. Safeco Plaza is a 50-story, approximately 765,000 net rentable square-foot, Class A office property. The acquisition was completed through a newly formed joint venture with two institutional partners. Each of the institutional partners invested approximately $71.9 million of cash for their respective 33.165% ownership interest in the joint venture. We invested approximately $72.6 million for our 33.67% interest in the joint venture and are providing customary operating, property management and leasing services to the joint venture. Our ownership includes (1) a 33.0% direct interest in the joint venture, and (2) an additional 1% interest in each of the two entities (each a “Safeco Partner Entity”) through which each partner owns its interest in the joint venture. Subject to the occurrence of certain events and the joint venture achieving certain return thresholds, we are entitled to earn promote distributions. Some of the promote distributions may be payable in cash or, at our election, additional equity interest(s) in the Safeco Partner Entity(ies). The purchase price was funded with cash and proceeds from a new mortgage loan collateralized by the property. The mortgage loan has a principal amount of $250.0 million, bears interest at a variable rate equal to the greater of (x) 2.35% or (y) LIBOR plus 2.20% per annum and matures on September 1, 2026.

Our partners will fund required capital until their aggregate investment is approximately 58% of all capital contributions; thereafter, the partners will fund required capital according to their percentage interests. Subject to the occurrence of certain events and the joint venture achieving certain return thresholds, we are entitled to earn promote distributions. Some of the promote distributions may be payable in cash or, at our election, additional equity interest(s) in the 360 Park Avenue South Partner Entity(ies). 

Stock Option and Incentive Plan

On February 2, 2021, BXP’s Compensation Committee approved a new equity-based, multi-year, long-term incentive program (the “2021 MYLTIP”) as a performance-based component of our overall compensation program. Under the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 718 “Compensation - Stock Compensation,” the 2021 MYLTIP has an aggregate value of approximately $15.3 million, which amount will generally be amortized into earnings under the graded vesting method (See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

On February 5, 2021, the measurement period for our 2018 MYLTIP awards ended and, based on BXP’s relative TSR performance, the final awards were determined to be 29.2% of target, or an aggregate of approximately $4.6 million (after giving effect to employee separations). As a result, an aggregate of 285,925 2018 MYLTIP Units that had been previously granted were automatically forfeited. 

Business and Growth Strategies

Business Strategies 

Our primary business objective is to maximize return on investment to provide our investors with the greatest possible total return in all points of the economic cycle. Our strategies to achieve this objective are:

•to target a few carefully selected geographic markets—Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC—and to be one of the leading, if not the leading, developers, owners and managers in each of those markets with a full-service office in each market providing property management, leasing, development, construction and legal expertise. We select markets and submarkets with a diverse economic base and a deep pool of prospective tenants in various industries and where 

8
tenants have demonstrated a preference for high-quality office buildings and other facilities. Additionally, our markets have historically been able to recruit new talent to them and as such created job growth that results in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. We have explored, and may continue to explore for future investment, select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits; 

•to emphasize markets and submarkets within those markets where the difficulty of receiving the necessary approvals for development and the necessary financing constitute high barriers to the creation of new supply, and where skill, financial strength and diligence are required to successfully develop, finance and manage high-quality office and life sciences space, as well as selected retail and residential space;

•to take on complex, technically challenging development projects, leveraging the skills of our management team to successfully develop, acquire or reposition properties that other organizations may not have the capacity or resources to pursue;

•to own and develop high-quality real estate designed to meet the demands of today’s tenants who require sophisticated telecommunications and related infrastructure, support services, sustainable features and amenities, including those amenities that enrich in-person experiences and support a hybrid work environment, and to manage those facilities so as to become the landlord of choice for both existing and prospective clients;

•to opportunistically acquire assets that increase our market share in the markets in which we have chosen to concentrate, as well as potential new markets, which exhibit an opportunity to improve returns through repositioning (through a combination of capital improvements and shift in marketing strategy), changes in management focus and leasing;

•to explore joint venture opportunities with (1) existing property owners located in desirable locations, who seek to benefit from the depth of development and management expertise we are able to provide and our access to capital and (2) expand our SCP, leveraging our skills as developers, owners and managers of Class A office space and mixed-use complexes;

•to pursue on a selective basis the sale of properties or interests therein, including core properties, to either (1) take advantage of the demand for our premier properties and realize the value we have created or (2) pare from our portfolio properties that we believe have slower future growth potential;

•to seek third-party development contracts to enable us to retain and utilize our existing development and construction management staff, especially when our internal development is less active or when new development is less-warranted due to market conditions; and

•to enhance our capital structure through our access to a variety of sources of capital and proactively manage our debt expirations. In the current economic climate with relatively low interest rates we have and will continue to attempt to lower the cost of our debt capital and seek opportunities to lock in such low rates through early debt repayment, refinancings and interest rate hedges.

Growth Strategies

External Growth Strategies

We believe that our development experience, our organizational depth, utilization of our SCP and our balance sheet position us to continue to selectively develop a range of property types, including high-rise urban developments, mixed-use developments (including office, residential and retail), low-rise suburban office properties and life sciences space, within budget and on schedule. We believe we are also well-positioned to achieve external growth through acquisitions. Other factors that contribute to our competitive position include:

•our control of sites (including sites under contract or option to acquire) in our markets that could support approximately 17.7 million additional square feet of new office, life sciences, retail and residential development;

•our reputation gained through 52 years of successful operations and the stability and strength of our existing portfolio of properties;

•our relationships with leading national corporations, universities and public institutions, including government agencies, seeking new facilities and development services;

9
•our relationships with nationally recognized financial institutions that provide capital to the real estate industry;

•our track record and reputation for executing acquisitions efficiently provide comfort to domestic and foreign institutions, private investors and corporations who seek to sell commercial real estate in our market areas;

•our ability to act quickly on due diligence and financing; 

•our relationships with institutional buyers and sellers of high-quality real estate assets;

•our ability to procure entitlements from multiple municipalities to develop sites and attract land owners to sell or partner with us; and

•our relationship with domestic and foreign investors, including SCP partners, who seek to partner with companies like ours.

Opportunities to execute our external growth strategy fall into three categories:

•Development in selected submarkets. We believe the selected development of well-positioned office, life sciences, residential buildings and mixed-use complexes may be justified in our markets. We believe in acquiring land after taking into consideration timing factors relating to economic cycles and in response to market conditions that allow for its development at the appropriate time. While we purposely concentrate in markets with high barriers-to-entry, we have demonstrated throughout our 52-year history, an ability to make carefully timed land acquisitions in submarkets where we can become one of the market leaders in establishing rent and other business terms. We believe that there are opportunities at key locations in our existing and other markets for a well-capitalized developer to acquire land with development potential.

In the past, we have been particularly successful at acquiring sites or options to purchase sites that need governmental approvals for development. Because of our development expertise, knowledge of the governmental approval process and reputation for quality development with local government regulatory bodies, we generally have been able to secure the permits necessary to allow development and to profit from the resulting increase in land value. We seek complex projects where we can add value through the efforts of our experienced and skilled management team leading to attractive returns on investment.

Our strong regional relationships and recognized development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn relatively significant returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.

•Acquisition of assets and portfolios of assets from institutions or individuals. We believe that due to our size, management strength and reputation, we are well positioned to acquire portfolios of assets or individual properties from institutions or individuals if valuations meet our criteria. In addition, we believe that our market knowledge and our liquidity and access to capital may provide us with a competitive advantage when pursuing acquisitions. Opportunities to acquire properties may also come through the purchase of first mortgage or mezzanine debt. We are also able to appeal to sellers wishing to contribute on a tax-deferred basis their ownership of property for equity in a diversified real estate operating company that offers liquidity through access to the public equity markets in addition to a quarterly distribution. Our ability to offer common and preferred units of limited partnership in BPLP to sellers who would otherwise recognize a taxable gain upon a sale of assets for cash or BXP’s common stock may facilitate these types of acquisitions on a tax-efficient basis. Recently promulgated Treasury regulations may limit the tax benefits previously available to sellers in some variations of these transactions.

•Acquisition of underperforming assets and portfolios of assets. We believe that because of our in-depth market knowledge and development experience in each of our markets, our national reputation with brokers, financial institutions, owners of real estate and others involved in the real estate market and our access to competitively-priced capital, we are well-positioned to identify and acquire existing, underperforming properties for competitive prices and to add significant additional value to such properties through our effective marketing strategies, repositioning/redevelopment expertise and a responsive property management program. 

10
Internal Growth Strategies

We believe that opportunities will exist to increase cash flow from our existing properties through an increase in occupancy and rental rates because they are of high quality and in desirable locations. Additionally, our markets have diversified economies that have historically experienced job growth and increased use of office space, resulting in growth in rental rates and occupancy over time. Our strategy for maximizing the benefits from these opportunities is three-fold: (1) to provide high-quality property management services using our employees in order to encourage tenants to renew, expand and relocate in our properties, (2) to achieve speed and transaction cost efficiency in replacing departing tenants through the use of in-house services for marketing, lease negotiation and construction of tenant and capital improvements and (3) to work with new or existing tenants with space expansion or contraction needs, leveraging our expertise and clustering of assets to maximize the cash flow from our assets. We expect to continue our internal growth as a result of our ability to: 

•Cultivate existing submarkets and long-term relationships with credit tenants. In choosing locations for our properties, we have paid particular attention to transportation and commuting patterns, physical environment, adjacency to established business centers and amenities, proximity to sources of business growth and other local factors.

The weighted-average lease term of our in-place leases based on square feet, including leases signed by our unconsolidated joint ventures, was approximately 7.9 years at December 31, 2021, and we continue to cultivate long-term leasing relationships with a diverse base of high-quality, financially stable tenants. Based on leases in place at December 31, 2021, leases with respect to approximately 6.4% of the total square feet in our portfolio, including unconsolidated joint ventures, will expire in calendar year 2022. 

•Directly manage our office properties to maximize the potential for tenant retention. We provide property management services ourselves, rather than contracting for this service, to maintain awareness of and responsiveness to tenant needs. We and our properties also benefit from cost efficiencies produced by an experienced work force attentive to preventive maintenance and energy management and from our continuing programs to assure that our property management personnel at all levels remain aware of their important role in tenant relations. In addition, we reinvest in our properties by adding new services and amenities that are desirable to our tenants. 

•Replace tenants quickly at best available market terms and lowest possible transaction costs. We believe that we are well-positioned to attract new tenants and achieve relatively high rental and occupancy rates as a result of our well-located, well-designed and well-maintained properties, our reputation for high-quality building services and responsiveness to tenants, and our ability to offer expansion and relocation alternatives within our submarkets.

•Extend terms of existing leases to existing tenants prior to expiration. We have also successfully structured early tenant renewals, which have reduced the cost associated with lease downtime while securing the tenancy of our highest quality credit-worthy tenants on a long-term basis and enhancing relationships.

•Re-development of existing assets.  We believe the select re-development of assets within our portfolio, where through the ability to increase the building size and/or to increase cash flow and generate appropriate returns on incremental investment after consideration of the asset’s current and future cash flows, may be desirable. This generally occurs in situations in which we are able to increase the building’s size, improve building systems, including conversion to higher yielding life sciences uses, and sustainability features, and/or add tenant amenities, thereby increasing tenant demand, generating acceptable returns on incremental investment and enhancing the long-term value of the property and the company. In the past, we have been particularly successful at gaining local government approval for increased density at several of our assets, providing the opportunity to enhance value at a particular location. Our strong regional relationships and recognized re-development expertise have enabled us to capitalize on unique build-to-suit opportunities. We intend to seek and expect to continue to be presented with such opportunities in the near term allowing us to earn attractive returns on these development opportunities through multiple business cycles.

Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG)

Our Strategy

We actively work to promote our growth and operations in a sustainable and responsible manner across our six regions. The BXP ESG strategy is to conduct our business, the development, ownership and operation of new and existing buildings, in a manner that contributes to positive economic, social and environmental outcomes for our customers, shareholders, employees and the communities we serve. Our investment philosophy is shaped by our core strategy of long-term ownership and our commitment to our communities and the centers of commerce and civic life that make them thrive. We are focused on developing and maintaining healthy, high-performance buildings, while simultaneously mitigating operational costs and the potential external impacts of energy, water, waste, greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Positive social impact is also of great importance to BXP and our employees, which is exhibited by our commitments to charitable giving, volunteerism, public realm investments and promoting diversity and inclusion in the workplace and our communities. Through these efforts, we demonstrate that operating and developing commercial real estate can be conducted with a conscious regard for the environment and broader society while mutually benefiting our stakeholders.

ESG Leadership

We continue to address the needs of our stakeholders by making efforts to maintain and improve our ESG performance across three pillars: climate action, climate resilience and social good. BXP is a widely recognized industry leader in ESG. 2021 ESG highlights include:

•BXP ranked among the top real estate companies in the GRESB assessment, earning a sixth consecutive 5-Star rating. 2021 was the tenth consecutive year that BXP earned the GRESB “Green Star” designation. 

•BXP was named to Newsweek’s America’s Most Responsible Companies 2022 list for the second consecutive year. BXP ranked first in the real estate industry with a ranking increase from 56th overall out of 421 companies in 2020 to 31st overall out of 499 companies in 2021.

•BXP was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) North America. BXP was one of nine real estate companies that qualified and the only office REIT in the index, scoring in the 93rd percentile of the real estate companies assessed for inclusion.

•BXP ranked #4 on the inaugural Forbes Green Growth 50, a list focused on large American corporations that have reduced greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously growing earnings. 

•BXP was named an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year – Sustained Excellence Award Winner.

•BXP was named a Green Lease Leader at the highest Gold level by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy for exhibiting a strong commitment to high performance and sustainability in buildings and best practices in leasing. 

Our leadership position is due, in part, to our establishment of environmental goals, the periodic reporting of progress towards our goals and the achievement of these goals.  We have publicly adopted energy, emissions, water and waste goals that establish reduction targets aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. As of the end of 2020, the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 41% decrease in energy use intensity and an 86% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions intensity below a 2008 base year. We have also aligned our emissions reduction targets with climate science and in 2020 became the first North American office REIT to establish an emissions reduction target ambition in line with a 1.5°C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission under the Science Based Targets initiative. In April 2021, we affirmed our commitment to achieving carbon-neutral operations (for direct and indirect scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control.

We are focused on developing, owning and operating healthy and high-performance buildings. BXP is a corporate member of the U.S. Green Building Council® (“USGBC”) and has a long history of green buildings under USGBC’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design™ (LEED®) rating system. We have LEED-certified 28.3 million square feet of our portfolio, of which 98% is certified at the highest Gold and Platinum levels. In 2018, we announced a partnership with a leading healthy building certification system, Fitwel, to support healthy building design and operational practices across our portfolio, becoming a Fitwel Champion. We completed our Fitwel Champion commitments and have added 16.7 million square feet of Fitwel certified buildings. In response to the 

12
COVID-19 pandemic, we completed the Fitwel Viral Response Module Enterprise and Asset-level Certification at all actively managed office properties. 

Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) Disclosures

The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by SASB in 2018 proposed sustainability accounting metrics designed for disclosure in mandatory filings, such as the Annual Report on Form 10-K, and serves as the framework against which we have aligned our disclosures for sustainability information. The recommended energy and water management activity metrics for the real estate industry include energy consumption data coverage as a percentage of floor area (“Energy Intensity”); percentage of the eligible portfolio that is certified ENERGY STAR® (“ENERGY STAR certified”); total energy consumed by portfolio area (“Total Energy Consumption”); water withdrawal as a percentage of total floor area (“Water Intensity”); and total water withdrawn by portfolio area (“Total Water Consumption”). Our energy and water data is collected from utility bills and submeters and is assured by an independent, third party assurance expert, which includes all SASB 2020 energy and water metrics. For more information on the independent, third-party assurance expert and the methodology used to assure the data, refer to “Reporting” below. During the 2020 calendar year, 52 buildings representing 49% of our eligible portfolio were ENERGY STAR certified. A licensed professional has verified all ENERGY STAR applications.

The charts below detail our Energy Intensity, Total Energy Consumption, Water Intensity and Total Water Consumption for 2015 through 2020 for which data were available on occupied and actively managed buildings where we had operational control.1,2,3,4,5,6

_______________

(1)Full 2021 calendar year energy and water data will not be available and assured by a third party until March 31, 2022. Therefore, 2020 is the most recent year for which complete and third-party assured energy and water data is available.

(2)The charts reflect the performance of our occupied and actively managed office building portfolio in Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC. The charts do not include performance data for our property in Seattle, which we acquired in September 2021. We defined “occupied office buildings” as buildings with no more than 50% vacancy. Actively managed buildings are buildings where we have operational control of building system performance and investment decisions. At the end of the 2020 calendar year, our occupied and actively managed buildings included 107 buildings totaling 42.2 million gross square feet, which accounted for approximately 83% of BXP’s total in-service portfolio by area.

(3)Floor area is considered to have complete energy consumption data coverage when energy consumption data (i.e., energy types and amounts consumed) is obtained by us for all types of energy consumed in the relevant floor area during the calendar year, regardless of when such data was obtained.

(4)The scope of energy includes energy purchased from sources external to us and our tenants or produced by us or our tenants and energy from all sources, including fuel, gas, electricity and steam. Energy use intensity (kBtu/SF) has been weather normalized.

(5)Water sources include surface water (including water from wetlands, rivers, lakes and oceans), groundwater, rainwater collected directly and stored by the registrant, wastewater obtained from other entities, municipal water supplies or supply from other water utilities.

(6)2020 data reflects the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Climate Resilience

As a long-term owner and active manager of real estate assets in operation and under development, we take a long-term view on climate change risks and opportunities. We are focused on understanding how climate change may impact the performance of our portfolio and the steps we can take to increase climate resilience. We continue to evaluate the potential risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio and are taking proactive steps to plan for and/or mitigate such risks. 

Ø Governance

As a vertically integrated, full-service real estate company, we are engaged in addressing climate-related issues at all levels of our organization. Management’s role in overseeing, assessing and managing climate-related risks, opportunities and initiatives is spread across multiple teams throughout our organization, including our Board of Directors, executive leadership and our Sustainability, Risk Management, Development, Construction and Property Management departments. BXP has a dedicated team of sustainability professionals focused on ESG issues that coordinate and collaborate across corporate and regional teams to advance environmental sustainability issues and initiatives. In 2021, our Board of Directors established a new, board-level Sustainability Committee to, among other things, increase Board oversight over sustainability issues, including climate-related risks and opportunities. The Sustainability Committee directly reports to and advises the Board of Directors on matters related to the environment, sustainability and climate change and resilience. 

Our approach to climate-related issues is also informed by robust stakeholder engagement. We are in frequent dialogue with investors, customers, community members, governmental policymakers, consultants and other non-governmental organizations. We are heavily involved in industry associations and participate in conferences and workshops covering ESG, sustainability and climate resilience topics. Through these engagements, we enhance our knowledge of climate-related issues and those issues that are most important to our stakeholders and industry best practices. 

Ø Strategy

We have aligned our climate-related disclosures with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). The TCFD framework has informed the development of our strategy for identifying and managing both physical and transition risks associated with climate change. As defined by the TCFD framework, physical risks associated with climate change include acute risks (extreme weather-related events) and chronic risks (such as extreme heat and sea-level rise), and transition risks associated with climate change include policy and legal risks, and other technology, market and reputation-related risks. 

We continue to proactively assess the potential risks that may impact the properties in our portfolio, but our assessment and analysis remain preliminary in nature as we gather information and monitor the evolving regulatory landscape related to climate change. Our process for assessing climate-related risks and their implications on our properties and business includes conducting climate change scenario analyses on our portfolio assets. In particular, we engaged Moody’s ESG Solutions (formerly branded as Four Twenty Seven Application), an independent provider of science-driven insights and analytics on climate risk, for its climate risk scoring to evaluate the forward-looking physical climate risk exposure of our entire portfolio. The scenario analysis and physical risk scoring was based on an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario, which is a worst-case, high emissions scenario, under a time horizon up to 2040. The scenario analysis included all in-service assets owned by BXP and included climate events such as hurricane, wildfire, heat, water stress, flooding and sea-level rise. We are also using Moody’s ESG Solutions data to identify potential risks during the new acquisition diligence process. The analysis of our portfolio yielded no material findings.

 We consider climate-related risks and opportunities in the context of the following time horizons: short-term (1-2 years), medium-term (3-10 years) and long-term (>10 years). Based on the foregoing process for evaluating climate-related risks, including the scenario analysis, we have identified (1) the following potential physical and transition risks associated with climate change that could impact our portfolio in the future across the stated time horizons and (2) BXP’s climate-related opportunities. We will continue to analyze the results of the Moody’s ESG Solutions analysis and the following risks and opportunities to understand our potential exposure and inform our climate resilience strategy and future investments, which include climate-related risk mitigation and initiatives. 

14
Time PeriodPhysical Risks

Short- to Medium-Term

Increased severity of extreme weather events, including flooding and wind damage, extreme heat and sea-level rise may cause one or more of the following to occur:

•Direct damage to properties

•Increased costs of property insurance

•Supply chain disruption

•Costs associated with capital expenditures and infrastructure-related remediation projects

•Alteration of designs at new and existing buildings

•Increased costs of real estate taxes or other assessments

Long-Term

Building adaptation, including architectural and mechanical improvements, could increase capital expenditure requirements.

Extreme drought and wildfires could adversely impact demand in markets prone to water scarcity and annual wildfire risk.

Sea-level rise and extreme weather events could make property insurance unavailable in high-risk areas.

Public transportation system disruptions could impact access to BXP buildings.

Chronic climate-related physical risks and associated downtime could result in declining demand for office space at impacted buildings.

Time PeriodTransition Risks

Short- to Medium-Term

Non-compliance with regulatory requirements, including energy and carbon performance standards, may increase costs and/or introduce potential fines.

Compliance with green building codes, including electrification of heating systems, may increase development and operational costs.

Failure to meet sustainability needs (e.g., net-zero requirements) of customers and investors could result in lost business.

Additional growth, particularly in life sciences, may increase energy and emissions intensities.

Long-TermReal estate taxes may increase to fund public projects to improve regional and neighborhood-scale resilience.

Time PeriodOpportunities

Short-Term

Energy and carbon reductions could result in greater product differentiation and competitive advantage.

Stronger ESG disclosures, particularly regarding climate action and resilience, may qualify BXP for greater inclusion in ESG ETFs and other funds.

BXP may benefit from a lower cost of capital from green bonds and/or sustainability-linked credit.

BXP may avoid operating cost increases from rising energy costs through actions focused on efficient operations.

Medium-Term

BXP may avoid penalties associated with building energy and carbon performance standards.

Assets may be converted and/or certified net-zero, which may increase demand for office space.

Long-TermBy focusing on the risks of climate change associated with acute and chronic physical risks during the development, acquisition and operating life of assets, BXP may mitigate losses and downtime resulting from extreme weather events.

15
Ø Risk Management

BXP is committed to managing and avoiding the impacts of climate change. Our risk management program includes physical and transition risks, including both climate mitigation (resource efficiency and emissions reduction) and adaptation (integration of climate resilience into our investment decision-making). We are actively acquiring, developing and operating a geographically diverse portfolio of high-quality commercial real estate properties. Individual assets have unique risk profiles and insurance requirements. Through the processes of acquisition, development and operation of our in-service portfolio, our experienced real estate professionals are identifying risks, including business continuity risks, loss exposure related to extreme weather events and impacts of regulation, including permitting requirements, codes, and energy and carbon performance standards. The climate risk profile of each individual property is largely dependent on the property’s unique attributes, physical location and jurisdictional regulatory requirements.

Asset-Level Risk Management

We carry all-risk property insurance on our properties including those under development. Insurance coverage mitigates the impact to BXP from losses associated with natural catastrophes, such as floods, fires, earthquakes and wind events. 

We are preparing for long-term climate risk by considering climate change scenarios and will continue to assess climate change vulnerabilities resulting from potential future climate scenarios and sea-level rise. We will continue to evaluate existing plans and procedures and proactively implement practical, cost-effective resiliency measures and infrastructure enhancements, including:

•Business Continuity Plans

•Emergency Response and Life Safety Plans

•Emergency Evacuation Planning, Procedures and Drills

•Tenant Engagement and Coordination

•Life Safety Analysis

•Elevation of vault, switchgear and critical equipment during new development

•Waterproofing of subgrade infrastructure

•Floodable first floors

•Temporary flood barriers

•Backup generation, emergency lighting and fire pumps

•Onsite energy resources and distributed generation, storage and solar photovoltaic systems.

We are managing transition risks by benchmarking energy, carbon, water and waste performance at the asset level and are prioritizing interventions at underperforming assets. We develop, operate and maintain a large portfolio of buildings that are LEED, ENERGY STAR and/or Fitwel certified. In 2021, 84% of our actively managed portfolio was certified under one or more of these frameworks. As a leader in green building, we will continue to make investments in building performance, energy efficiency and decarbonization.

Through our climate action efforts, we believe we can play a leading role in advancing the transition to a low carbon economy and are taking action to decarbonize operations. Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) sources include the generated electricity and steam at offsite generation facilities, the onsite combustion of fuels (e.g., natural gas), and emissions associated with other business activities, including business travel and new development. We continue to explore and implement creative and cost-effective measures that reduce GHG emissions from our operations. 

BXP became a proud signatory of the We Are Still In pledge after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and has aligned emissions reduction targets with climate science. The SBTi Target Validation Team has classified BXP’s emissions reduction target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5°C trajectory, the most ambitious designation available at the time of submission. We are committed to achieving carbon-neutral operations, or net-zero carbon dioxide equivalent emissions, which includes direct and indirect scope 1 and scope 2 emission, by 2025 from our occupied and actively managed buildings where we have operational control. 

16
BXP’s Carbon-Neutral Operations Strategy 

Our strategy to achieve carbon-neutral operations includes the following goals:

(1)Energy Efficient Operations – Approximately 1/3 of total carbon reductions by 2025 (below a 2008 base year) from energy conservation and efficient operations.

(2)Renewable Energy – Advancement of onsite development of renewable energy systems and sourcing offsite renewable energy to meet 100% of our electricity needs by 2025. 

(3)Electrification – Explore and advance electrification, prioritizing electrification of new developments and replacement of onsite gas-fired systems at existing buildings at the end of their useful lives. 

(4)Carbon Offsets – To the extent necessary, offset any remaining emissions during the transition to carbon-free energy.

The resilience of our markets may depend on the action taken by cities to adapt transportation, energy, and communication infrastructure for extreme heat, weather events, sea-level rise and flooding. We will continue to encourage the adaptation of our cities and management of physical and transition risks by maintaining a voice in policy decision-making at the local level through direct engagement and/or advocacy through collective membership-based groups.

Ø Metrics

We closely monitor energy consumption and associated GHG emissions and provide detailed accounting of ESG key performance indicators in our annual ESG reporting. As of the end of 2020, the combined impacts of efficiency measures, renewable energy and reduced physical occupancy due to the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a 41% decrease in energy use intensity and an 86% reduction in GHG emissions intensity below a base year of 2008. BXP’s carbon-neutral commitment includes direct and indirect scope 1 and scope 2 emissions from our actively managed office portfolio where we have operational control. Scope 1 and scope 2 emissions include emissions associated with total, whole-building energy consumption (landlord and tenant). Scope 1 emissions include all emissions associated with the onsite combustion of fossil fuels for heating, hot water and standby generators. Scope 2 emissions include all emissions associated with the offsite generation of electricity and steam. As our business continues to grow, carbon reduction targets and the transparent disclosure of ESG metrics will remain a priority. 

Reporting

A notable part of our commitment to sustainable development and operations is our commitment to transparent reporting of ESG performance indicators, as we recognize the importance of this information to investors, lenders and others in understanding how BXP assesses sustainability information and evaluates risks and opportunities. We publish an annual ESG report that is aligned with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) reporting framework, United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. BXP’s ESG Report includes our strategy, key performance indicators, annual like-for-like comparisons, and achievements. The report is available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Commitment.” Our annual ESG reports, including all of our energy, water and emissions metrics included therein, are assured by an independent, third-party assurance expert. The assurance expert performs an independent verification for certain of our ESG performance indicators and issues an opinion, which is attached to each ESG report, that opines on each ESG report’s inclusiveness, materiality, sustainability context, completeness, and reliability. 

We have been an active participant in the green bond market since 2018, which provides access to sustainability-focused investors interested in the positive environmental externalities of our business activities. Since 2018, BPLP has issued an aggregate of $3.55 billion of green bonds in four separate offerings. The terms of the green bonds have restrictions that limit our allocation of the net proceeds to “eligible green projects.” We published our first Green Bond Allocation Report in June 2019, disclosing the full allocation of approximately $988 million in net proceeds from BPLP’s inaugural green bond offering in 2018 to the eligible green project at our Salesforce Tower property in San Francisco, California. Our September 30, 2020 Green Bond Allocation Report disclosed the full allocation of approximately $841 million in net proceeds from BPLP’s green bond offering in June 2019. The Green Bond Allocation Reports are available on our website at http://www.bxp.com under the heading “Commitment.”

Except for the documents specifically incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the information contained on our website or that can be accessed through our website is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Human Capital Management

Our culture supports and nurtures our employees. We believe our employees are a significant distinguishing factor that sets BXP apart. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 743 employees. Our operational and financial performance depends on their talents, energy, experience and well-being. Our ability to attract and retain talented people depends on a number of factors, including work environment, career development and professional training, compensation and benefits, and the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We have an established reputation for excellence and integrity and these core values are inherent in our culture and play a critical role in achieving our goals and overall success. 

Diversity & Inclusion 

We strive to create a diverse and inclusive workplace. It has been, and will continue to be, our policy to recruit, hire, assign, promote and train in all job titles without regard to race, national origin, religion, age, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, protected veteran status, or any other characteristic protected by local, state, or federal laws, rules, or regulations. By implementing this policy, we aim to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to make their maximum contribution to us and to their own career goals.

In 2020, we launched the BXP Diversity & Inclusion Committee and, in 2021, we further advanced our mission to promote diversity, inclusion, equality and transparency as part of our culture, business activities and decision-making practices. We identified actionable diversity goals and proposed initiatives in the areas of recruitment and development, company policies and community outreach.

(3) “Other” represents American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and two or more races.

Culture & Employee Engagement

We believe that the success of our business is tied to the quality of our workforce, and we strive to maintain a corporate environment without losing the entrepreneurial spirit with which we were founded more than 50 years ago. By providing a quality workplace and comprehensive benefit programs, we recognize the commitment of our employees to bring their talent, energy, and experience to us. Our continued success is attributable to our employees’ expertise and dedication. 

We periodically conduct employee engagement surveys to monitor our employees’ satisfaction in different aspects of their employment, including leadership, communication, career development and benefits offerings. Past employee responsiveness to the engagement surveys has been consistently high and the results help inform us on matters that our employees view as key contributors to a positive work experience. Based on the employee engagement survey conducted in 2020, with 93% responsiveness, the overall company-wide favorability result was a “very favorable” rating with ratings exceeding 80% favorability in all categories. We intend to continue to periodically evaluate employee satisfaction as needed on a meaningful basis. 

Another indicator of the success of our efforts in the workplace is the long tenure of our employees, 38% of whom have worked at BXP for ten or more years. The average tenure of our employees is approximately 9.97 years and that of our executive leadership is 18.77 years. In 2021, our total workforce turnover rate was 16.6%. 

Career Development & Training 

We invest significant resources in our employees’ personal and professional growth and development and provide a wide range of tools and development opportunities that build and strengthen employees’ leadership and professional skills. These development opportunities include in-person and virtual training sessions, in-house learning opportunities, various management trainings, departmental conferences, executive townhalls and external 

19
programs. We foster an environment of growth and internal promotion, and strive for a best-in-class candidate experience for our internal applicants. Open positions are posted and employees are highly encouraged to apply for promotion within the organization. During 2021, we promoted 11% of our employees to elevated roles within our organization. Of the employees that were promoted, 43% were women and 37% were non-White.

Compensation & Benefits

We designed our compensation program with the goal of providing a balanced and effective way of ensuring internal equity and market competitiveness in our pay practices. We have coupled external, market-driven data with an equitable performance review assessment tool in an effort to strike the balance that best represents our compensation strategy and links pay to performance. On an annual basis, our Human Resources department evaluates market compensation ranges for each position to ensure we are appropriately compensating our top performers. We believe this total rewards program directly aligns with our compensation and benefits strategy.

Our employee benefit programs are designed to meet the needs of our diverse workforce, support our employees and their families by offering comprehensive programs that provide flexibility and choice in coverage, make available valuable resources to protect and enhance financial security and help balance work and personal life. Some of the benefits that we offer our employees include:

•health, telehealth, dental and vision insurance, 

•a 401(k) plan with a generous matching contribution, 

•an employee stock purchase plan, 

•health care and dependent care reimbursement accounts, 

•income protection through our sick pay, salary continuation and long-term disability policies, 

•a scholarship program for the children of non-officer employees, 

•a commuter subsidy to support the use of public transportation, 

•tuition reimbursement, and 

•paid vacation, holiday, personal and volunteer days to balance work and personal life.

Health, Safety & Wellness

As one of the largest publicly-traded office REITs (based on total market capitalization as of December 31, 2021) in the United States, we are keenly aware of the influence of buildings on human health and its importance to our tenants and employees. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, our focus on healthy buildings has become even more important. The health, safety and security of our employees, tenants, contractors and others is our highest priority. In early 2020, we convened a Health Security Task Force of subject matter experts from both inside and outside BXP to develop the BXP Health Security Plan, which we published in May of 2020 and updated in March 2021. The BXP Health Security Plan is a comprehensive set of building operational measures, including cleaning and disinfection, air and water quality, physical distancing, screening and personal protective equipment and health security communication. We conduct health and security quality audits to ensure implementation and effectiveness of the plan at our properties. In addition, in 2021, we commenced an initiative focused on indoor air quality, and in early 2022, plan to install new indoor air quality monitoring monitors across more than 40 buildings using sensors that will provide real-time data. 

We believe the success of our employees is dependent upon their overall well-being, including their physical health, mental health, work-life balance and financial well-being. In addition to the benefits outlined above, we also offer our employees an Employee Wellness Program and an Employee Assistance Program. The Employee Wellness Program was established in 2016 to encourage employees to improve their health and well-being by offering activities facilitated through an engaging and personalized approach. Program participants receive a reduction in their health insurance deduction cost. The Employee Assistance Program includes services for childcare, eldercare, personal relationship information, financial planning assistance, stress management, mental illness and general wellness and self-help.

Policies with Respect to Certain Activities

The discussion below sets forth certain additional information regarding our investment, financing and other policies. These policies have been determined by BXP’s Board of Directors and, in general, may be amended or revised from time to time by the Board of Directors.

Investment Policies

Investments in Real Estate or Interests in Real Estate

Our investment objectives are to provide quarterly cash dividends/distributions to our securityholders and to achieve long-term capital appreciation through increases in our value. We have not established a specific policy regarding the relative priority of these investment objectives.

We expect to continue to pursue our investment objectives primarily through the ownership of our current properties, development and redevelopment projects and other acquired properties. We currently intend to continue to invest primarily in developments of properties and acquisitions of existing improved properties or properties in need of redevelopment, and acquisitions of land that we believe have development potential, primarily in our existing markets of Boston, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Seattle and Washington, DC. We have explored and may continue to explore for future investment in select domestic and international markets that exhibit these same traits. Future investment or development activities will not be limited to a specified percentage of our assets. We intend to engage in such future investment or development activities in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of BXP’s status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. In addition, we may purchase or lease income-producing commercial and other types of properties for long-term investment, expand and improve the real estate presently owned or other properties purchased, or sell such real estate properties, in whole or in part, when circumstances warrant. We do not have a policy that restricts the amount or percentage of assets that will be invested in any specific property, however, our investments may be restricted by our debt covenants.

We may also continue to participate with third parties in property ownership, through joint ventures or other types of co-ownership. These investments may permit us to own interests in larger assets without unduly restricting diversification and, therefore, add flexibility in structuring our portfolio.

Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness or such financing or indebtedness as may be incurred in connection with acquiring or refinancing these investments. Debt service on such financing or indebtedness will have a priority over any distributions with respect to BXP’s common stock. Investments are also subject to our policy not to be treated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). 

Investments in Real Estate Mortgages

While our current portfolio consists primarily of, and our business objectives emphasize, equity investments in commercial real estate, we may, at the discretion of the Board of Directors of BXP, invest in mortgages and other types of real estate interests consistent with BXP’s qualification as a REIT. Investments in real estate mortgages run the risk that one or more borrowers may default under such mortgages and that the collateral securing such mortgages may not be sufficient to enable us to recoup our full investment. We may invest in participating, convertible or traditional mortgages if we conclude that we may benefit from the cash flow, or any appreciation in value of the property or as an entrance to the fee ownership. As of December 31, 2021, we had two note receivables outstanding, which aggregated approximately $88.0 million. 

Securities of or Interests in Entities Primarily Engaged in Real Estate Activities

Subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for BXP’s REIT qualification, we also may invest in securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers, including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities.

Dispositions

We decide to dispose or partially dispose of properties based upon the periodic review of our portfolio and the determination by the Board of Directors of BXP that doing so is in our best interests. Any decision to dispose of a property will be authorized by the Board of Directors of BXP or a committee thereof. Some holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP could incur adverse tax consequences upon the sale of certain of our properties that differ from the tax consequences to BXP. Consequently, holders of limited partnership interests in BPLP may have different objectives regarding the appropriate pricing and timing of any such sale. Such different tax treatment derives in most cases from the fact that we acquired these properties in exchange for partnership interests in contribution transactions structured to allow the prior owners to defer taxable gain. Generally, this deferral continues so long as we do not dispose of the properties in a taxable transaction. Unless a sale by us of these properties is structured as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), or in a manner that otherwise allows deferral to continue, recognition of the deferred tax gain 

21
allocable to these prior owners is generally triggered by a sale. As of December 31, 2021, we had one property that was subject to a tax protection agreement, which may limit our ability to dispose of the asset or require us to pay damages to the prior owner in the event of a taxable sale in violation of the agreement. The tax protection agreement expires on December 14, 2033, or earlier if certain conditions by the prior owner are met.

Financing Policies 

The agreement of limited partnership of BPLP and BXP’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur. Further, we do not have a policy limiting the amount of indebtedness that we may incur, nor have we established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole. However, our mortgages, credit facilities, joint venture agreements and unsecured debt securities contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness. In addition, we evaluate the impact of incremental leverage on our debt metrics and the credit ratings of BPLP’s publicly traded debt. A reduction in BPLP’s credit ratings could result in us borrowing money at higher interest rates.

The Board of Directors of BXP will consider a number of factors when evaluating our level of indebtedness and when making decisions regarding the incurrence of indebtedness, including the purchase price of properties to be acquired with debt financing, the estimated market value of our properties upon refinancing, the entering into agreements such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other interest rate hedging contracts and the ability of particular properties and us as a whole to generate cash flow to cover expected debt service. 

Policies with Respect to Other Activities

As the sole general partner of BPLP, BXP has the authority to issue additional common and preferred units of limited partnership interest of BPLP. BXP has issued, and may in the future issue, common or preferred units of limited partnership interest to persons who contribute their direct or indirect interests in properties to us in exchange for such common or preferred units. We have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of issuers other than BXP and BPLP does not intend to do so. At all times, we intend to make investments in such a manner as to enable BXP to maintain its qualification as a REIT, unless, due to changes in circumstances or to the Code, the Board of Directors of BXP determines that it is no longer in the best interest of BXP to qualify as a REIT. We may make loans to third parties, including, without limitation, to joint ventures in which we participate or in connection with the disposition of a property. We intend to make investments in such a way that we will not be treated as an investment company under the 1940 Act. Our policies with respect to these and other activities may be reviewed and modified or amended from time to time by the Board of Directors of BXP. 

Governmental Regulations

General

Compliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, (1) federal securities laws and regulations, (2) applicable stock exchange requirements, and (3) federal, state and local laws and regulations related to (a) our status as a REIT and other tax laws and regulations, and (b) real property, the improvements thereon and the operation thereof, such as laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, zoning, usage, building, fire and life safety codes, (4) the requirements of the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury and (5) the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. In addition to the discussion below, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors” for a discussion of these governmental regulations and other material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, and see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes included therein, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations, including, to the extent material, the effects that compliance with governmental regulations may have upon our capital expenditures and earnings.

Environmental Matters

It is our policy to retain independent environmental consultants to conduct or update Phase I environmental assessments (which generally do not involve invasive techniques such as soil or ground water sampling) and asbestos surveys in connection with our acquisition of properties. These pre-purchase environmental assessments 

22
have not revealed environmental conditions that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity, and we are not otherwise aware of environmental conditions with respect to our properties that we believe would have such a material adverse effect. However, from time to time environmental conditions at our properties have required and may in the future require environmental testing and/or regulatory filings, as well as remedial action. 

For example, in February 1999, we (through a joint venture) acquired from Exxon Corporation a property in Massachusetts that was formerly used as a petroleum bulk storage and distribution facility and was known by the state regulatory authority to contain soil and groundwater contamination. We developed an office park on the property. We engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to oversee the management of contaminated soil and groundwater that was disturbed in the course of construction. Under the property acquisition agreement, Exxon agreed to (1) bear the liability arising from releases or discharges of oil and hazardous substances which occurred at the site prior to our ownership, (2) continue monitoring and/or remediating such releases and discharges as necessary and appropriate to comply with applicable requirements, and (3) indemnify us for certain losses arising from preexisting site conditions. Any indemnity claim may be subject to various defenses and contractual limitations, including time limits, and there can be no assurance that the amounts paid under the indemnity, if any, would be sufficient to cover the liabilities arising from any such releases and discharges. 

Environmental investigations at some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates have identified groundwater contamination migrating from off-site source properties. In each case we engaged a licensed environmental consultant to perform the necessary investigations and assessments, and to prepare any required submittals to the regulatory authorities. In each case the environmental consultant concluded that the properties qualify under the regulatory program or the regulatory practice for a status which eliminates certain deadlines for conducting response actions at a site. We also believe that these properties qualify for liability relief under certain statutory provisions or regulatory practices regarding upgradient releases. Although we believe that the current or former owners of the upgradient source properties may bear responsibility for some or all of the costs of addressing the identified groundwater contamination, we will take such further response actions (if any) that we deem necessary or advisable. Other than periodic testing at some of these properties, no such additional response actions are anticipated at this time. 

Some of our properties and certain properties owned by our affiliates are located in urban, industrial and other previously developed areas where fill or current or historical use of the areas have caused site contamination. Accordingly, it is sometimes necessary to institute special soil and/or groundwater handling procedures and/or include particular building design features in connection with development, construction and other property operations in order to achieve regulatory closure and/or ensure that contaminated materials are addressed in an appropriate manner. In these situations, it is our practice to investigate the nature and extent of detected contamination, including potential issues associated with vapor intrusion concerns and/or potential contaminant migration to or from the subject property in ground water, assess potential liability risks and estimate the costs of required response actions and special handling procedures. We then use this information as part of our decision-making process with respect to the acquisition, deal structure and/or development of the property. For example, we own a parcel in Massachusetts which was formerly used as a quarry/asphalt batching facility. Pre-purchase testing indicated that the site contained relatively low levels of certain contaminants. We have developed an office park on this property. Prior to and during redevelopment activities, we engaged a specially licensed environmental consultant to monitor environmental conditions at the site and prepare necessary regulatory submittals based on the results of an environmental risk characterization. A submittal has been made to the regulatory authorities in order to achieve regulatory closure at this site. The submittal included an environmental deed restriction that mandates compliance with certain protective measures in a portion of the site where low levels of residual soil contamination have been left in place in accordance with applicable laws. 

We expect that resolution of the environmental matters described above will not have a material impact on our business, assets, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. However, we cannot assure you that we have identified all environmental liabilities at our properties, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties, that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, or that we will have insurance coverage in the event that such environmental liabilities arise.

Competition

We compete in the leasing of office, life sciences, retail and residential space with a considerable number of other real estate companies, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us. In addition, our hotel property competes for guests with other hotels, some of which may have greater marketing and financial resources than are available to us and to the manager of our one hotel, Marriott International, Inc. 

Principal factors of competition in our primary business of owning, acquiring and developing office properties are the quality of properties, leasing terms (including rent and other charges and allowances for tenant improvements), attractiveness and convenience of location, the quality and breadth of tenant services and amenities provided, and reputation as an owner and operator of quality office properties in the relevant market. Additionally, our ability to compete depends upon, among other factors, trends in the national and local economies, investment alternatives, financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, utilities, governmental regulations, legislation and population trends. 

In addition, we currently have six residential properties and may in the future decide to acquire or develop additional residential properties. As an owner, we will also face competition for prospective residents from other operators/owners whose properties may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose rent may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location and amenities that the resident seeks. We will also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent. Because the scale of our residential portfolio is relatively small, we expect to continue to retain third parties to manage our residential properties.

Our Hotel Property

We operate our hotel property through a taxable REIT subsidiary. The taxable REIT subsidiary, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BPLP, is the lessee pursuant to a lease for the hotel property. As lessor, BPLP is entitled to a percentage of gross receipts from the hotel property. The hotel lease is intended to provide the economic benefits of ownership of the underlying real estate to flow to us as rental income, while our taxable REIT subsidiary earns the profit from operating the property as a hotel. Marriott International, Inc. continues to manage the hotel property under the Marriott name and under terms of the existing management agreements. Marriott has been engaged under a separate long-term incentive management agreement to operate and manage the hotel on behalf of the taxable REIT subsidiary.
