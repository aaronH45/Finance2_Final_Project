Item 1. Business.

 Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated ("Leggett & Platt," "Company," "we," "us," or "our"), a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs, and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes and automobiles. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 15 business units, which are divided into seven groups under our three segments: Bedding Products; Specialized Products; and Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products.

 Overview of Our Segments

Bedding Products Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our Bedding Products segment has its roots in the Company's founding in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coil bedsprings. Today, we support our customers' needs from raw materials to components to finished mattresses and foundations to distribution and fulfillment. Our innerspring, specialty foam, and finished product development and production capabilities allow us to create value at each point, from raw materials all the way to private label finished goods and delivery to the consumer. 

We operate a steel rod mill in the U.S. with historical annual output of about 500,000 tons. A substantial majority of that output has been used by our two U.S. wire mills that have supplied virtually all of the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. We also supply steel rod and wire to trade customers that operate in a broad range of markets.

We are a major supplier of adjustable beds, with domestic manufacturing and distribution, and global sourcing capabilities. We also produce machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component and finished product needs.

These innovative proprietary products and our efficient and low-cost vertical integration have made us the largest U.S.-based manufacturer in many of these businesses. We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting end-consumer needs. We believe we attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, large-scale production, and purchasing leverage. Sourcing components and finished products from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising, and marketing their products.

Strategic Priorities

Primary Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR) is a primary financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. We target average annual TSR of 11–14% through an approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.

Our incentive programs reward return and cash generation, and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 300 peers). For information about our TSR targets, see the discussion under Total Shareholder Return in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 32. 

Disciplined Growth

The expected long-term contribution to TSR from revenue growth is 6-9%. From 2019 to 2021, we generated combined unit volume and acquisition growth of 2% per year on average. We also benefited from commodity inflation, resulting in total revenue growth of 6% per year on average. We expect to achieve the growth target through a combination of sources, including: (i) increasing content and new programs, particularly in our Bedding Products and Specialized Products segments; (ii) expanding our addressable markets; and (iii) identifying strategic acquisitions that complement our current products or capabilities. 

We will continue to make investments to support expansion in current businesses and product lines where sales are growing profitably. We also envision periodic acquisitions that add capabilities in these businesses or provide opportunities 

6
PART I

to enter more diverse, faster-growing, and higher margin markets. We expect all acquisitions to have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in attractive and growing markets.

Returning Cash to Shareholders

From 2019 to 2021, we generated $1.54 billion of operating cash, and we returned some of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends ($634 million) and share repurchases ($37 million). Our long-term priorities for use of cash are: fund organic growth including capital expenditures, pay dividends, fund strategic acquisitions, and repurchase stock with available cash. Recently, because of the debt level increases in connection with the Elite Comfort Solutions (ECS) acquisition in early 2019, we have focused on deleveraging by temporarily limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisition spending, and using operating cash flow to repay debt.

For information about dividends and share repurchases, see the discussion under Dividends on page 47 and Stock Repurchases on page 47 in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Macro Market Challenges

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic began in early 2020 materially reducing the demand for our products. We responded to the pandemic by, among other things, aligning our variable cost structure to reduced demand levels, significantly reducing fixed costs, and cutting capital expenditures. We ended 2020 with fixed cost savings of approximately $90 million. By mid-second quarter of 2020, we began to see rapid recovery in businesses serving home-related and auto markets which benefited our Bedding, Home Furniture, Flooring and Textile, and Automotive businesses. 

As demand recovered in Bedding, we began to face global constraints, including shortages of nonwoven fabrics used in the production of ComfortCore® innersprings and availability of labor. Labor issues were amplified by the rapid change in our production needs. Our operations shifted from a near shutdown in early April 2020 to customer demand in excess of pre-pandemic levels in a matter of weeks across many of our businesses. Chemical shortages also emerged as producers of the chemicals used to make foam were impacted by various weather issues and reported a variety of equipment and production issues.

In 2021, despite continued macro market challenges, including supply chain issues related to semiconductor shortages, foam chemical shortages, labor availability, and transportation challenges, as well as higher costs associated with each of these issues, we recorded record sales and earnings from continuing operations. We made progress on the chemical and labor shortages; however, both of these issues continued throughout 2021. Semiconductor shortages are expected to continue through at least 2023. 

For more information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business, refer to COVID-19 Impacts on our Business in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 33. 

Acquisitions

2021

In January 2021, we acquired a United Kingdom (UK) manufacturer specializing in metallic ducting systems, flexible joints, and components for the space, military, and commercial applications for a cash purchase price of $28 million. This acquisition expanded the capabilities of our aerospace products business to include flexible joint fabrication and operates within our Specialized Products segment.

Dependence on Market Demand for Key Product Families

Our business is dependent upon the market demand for, and continued sale of, various product families. The following table shows our approximate percentage of trade sales by product family for the last three years which indicates the degree of dependence upon market demand: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government. As such, our business is not materially dependent upon governmental customers. 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use, except for semiconductors and certain chemicals as explained below. Among the most important raw materials that we use are:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Currently there is a shortage of semiconductors in the automotive industry. Automotive OEMs and other suppliers have not been able to secure an adequate supply of semiconductors, and as a result have reduced or completely shut down their production of some automobiles or parts, which in turn has reduced our sale of products. Consumer demand remains strong, but the semiconductor shortage has pushed vehicle inventories to very low levels. Our Automotive Group uses the semiconductors in seat comfort products, and to a lesser extent in motors and actuators. To date, our Automotive Group has been able to obtain an adequate supply of semiconductors. We are dependent on our suppliers to deliver these semiconductors in accordance with our production schedule, and a shortage of the semiconductors can disrupt our operations and our ability to deliver products to our customers. If we cannot secure an adequate supply of semiconductors in our supply chain, or the automotive OEMs and other suppliers continue to reduce their production as a result of such shortage, this may negatively impact our sales, earnings, and financial condition.

We have exposure to the cost of chemicals, including TDI, MDI, and polyol. The cost of these chemicals has fluctuated at times, but we have generally passed the changes through to our customers. Chemical prices deflated in the first half of 2020. Inflation began in the second half of the year and continued throughout 2021 as a result of several factors, including robust demand, shortages from severe weather, supplier production disruptions, port delays, and logistics challenges. The supply shortages resulted in significant restrictions by producers, however, supply availability improved in late fourth quarter 2021. If we are unable to obtain the chemicals or pass the cost along to our customers, our results of operations may be negatively impacted.

11
PART I

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses. We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2021, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 33% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole, and on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including each of our segments.

Patents and Trademarks

 As of December 31, 2021, we had 1,207 patents issued, 501 patents in process, 1,081 trademarks registered and 78 trademarks in process. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations as a whole. A significant number of our patents relate to products manufactured in each of our three segments, while over half of our trademarks relate to products manufactured by the Bedding Products segment. We do not have any patent or group of patents, the expiration of which would have a material negative effect on our results of operations or financial condition. 

Some of our most significant trademarks include: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Product Development

One of our strongest performing product categories across the Company is ComfortCore®, our fabric-encased innerspring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses. ComfortCore® represented over 60% of our U.S. innerspring units in 2021. A number of our ComfortCore® innersprings contain a feature we call Quantum® Edge. These are narrow-diameter, fabric-encased coils that form a perimeter around an innerspring set, replacing a rigid foam perimeter in a finished mattress. In 2021, approximately 50% of our ComfortCore® innersprings in the U.S. had the Quantum® Edge feature. 

Our Specialty Foam business formulates many of the chemicals and additives used in the production of specialty foams for the bedding and furniture industries. These branded, specialty polyols and additives enhance foam performance by reducing heat retention, improving durability, and diminishing odor. These innovations enable us to create quality mattresses that can be compressed, and we have a significant amount of intellectual property around these specialty chemical formulations.

12
PART I

Our Automotive business designs and engineers lightweight structures that help reduce overall vehicle weight, improve fuel efficiency, and reduce noise while maintaining performance, safety, and functionality. These products help auto manufacturers meet emission standards and their environmental goals.

Many of our other businesses are engaged in product development activities to protect our market position, support ongoing growth, and help our customers achieve their sustainability goals. 

Human Capital Management

Our long-term success depends on our ability to attract and retain diverse talent, develop that talent, and plan for future succession. The first step toward building our future is to enable a culture of employee development and engagement at all levels of the Company by ensuring our employees have the tools and resources they need to succeed. Our employees are encouraged to actively develop their skills and take ownership in our success. We also recognize the importance of keeping our employees safe. In the following sections, we discuss our efforts to achieve these objectives. 

Board Oversight

The Board’s Human Resources and Compensation Committee has oversight of the Company’s human capital management, including oversight of (i) our human resources policies and programs; (ii) CEO, executive officer, and director compensation; (iii) our equity and incentive compensation plans; (iv) executive succession planning; and (v) senior management leadership development. Such oversight is designed to (i) support our business objectives; (ii) attract, retain, and develop high quality leadership; and (iii) link compensation with business objectives and performance. 

Our Employees

Our Employees. At year-end 2021, we had approximately 20,300 employees, of which 14,800 were engaged in production and 11,300 were international employees (including 5,500 in Asia and 3,200 in Europe). Of these employees, 7,100 were in Bedding Products, 7,400 were in Specialized Products, and 5,000 were in Furniture, Flooring & Textile Products, with the remainder at our corporate office or in other roles. At year-end 2020, we had approximately 20,400 employees.

Collective Bargaining. At year-end 2021, 16% of our employees were represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages, or other issues. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to labor contract negotiations during 2021. Management is not aware of circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2022.

Our Ability to Attract, Recruit, and Retain Employees

We operate in competitive labor markets, and accordingly, we strive to attract, recruit, and retain employees through competitive compensation and benefit programs, learning and development opportunities that support career growth and advancement opportunities, and employee engagement initiatives that foster a strong Company culture. 

Competitive Compensation and Benefits. In addition to cash compensation, we offer customary benefits in accordance with local regulatory requirements. Many of our locations offer health and welfare benefits to eligible employees and their dependents which may include, but are not limited to, health insurance, dental and vision plans, flexible spending plans, retirement savings with matching contributions, and income protection benefits, such as short and long-term disability insurance, life insurance, and paid leave benefits that include vacation, personal time, and holidays. In the U.S., we offer a well-being program which includes counseling, legal and financial consultation, work-life assistance, and crisis intervention services. Additionally, in the U.S. and Canada, our employees are eligible to participate in discount stock purchase plans. We also provide cash and equity incentive programs for key management employees based on our performance. Finally, we support the work-life balance of our employees, including part-time jobs, flexible hours, paid leave benefits, and remote and hybrid working, where applicable.

Employee Engagement and Satisfaction. At many of our locations, we analyze employee satisfaction and attempt to enhance engagement and mitigate related risks. Important data on employee satisfaction, feedback, and turnover are 

13
PART I

analyzed to identify improvement opportunities. The results of surveys and data analyses are used to assess human capital risks and identify opportunities for more meaningful employee engagement. From this analysis, action plans are developed, and branch-level initiatives are adopted to improve engagement and reduce turnover. We also engage with our employees through our Ethics Hotline, which serves as a grievance-reporting mechanism. Employees can express concerns, confidentially and anonymously, regarding possible violations of ethics, law, or our policies. 

A core element of our human capital strategy is our ability to attract, inform, and engage talented job seekers. To offer potential employees relevant insight into the culture of the Company, we maintain a comprehensive social media strategy. Via the Life@Leggett blog, we regularly publish content showcasing Company history, product advancements, cultural events, and community engagement.

Turnover. We rely on a diverse workforce to sustain our strategies and deliver our results of operations. In order to achieve our goals, this workforce must be stable. In 2021, our turnover rates in the U.S. were reasonably comparable to average voluntary turnover rates of manufacturers in the industries in which we operate. 

Our Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity

We continue to foster a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equity (ID&E) in which everyone is respected, valued, and has an equal opportunity to contribute, thrive, and advance. Our commitment is unwavering, and we are steadfast in maintaining our focus on building a workforce that represents the many customers we serve and the communities in which we operate around the world. In furtherance of this commitment, we expect to continue building our foundational awareness, understanding, engagement, and skills.

Fostering an Inclusive and Diverse Culture. We believe diverse teams generate better ideas and make better decisions, and that companies who lead in inclusion and diversity also lead financially. We have created strategies and action plans designed to foster an inclusive and diverse culture that aligns with our values and priorities. 

Inclusion, Diversity, and Equity Plan. We have an inclusion and diversity team comprised of a broad group of employees including senior management. The team has established long-term strategies and action plans designed to: (i) ensure that we have a safe and inclusive workplace; (ii) equip our people to attract, develop, retain, and reward a diverse and inclusive workforce; (iii) be an inclusive and equitable corporate citizen; (iv) develop a governance and accountability model that will sustain inclusion and diversity; and (v) enhance our business results. To date, our team has:

•hired an ID&E Director to guide our priorities, plans, and actions;

•established a calendar of multicultural events and shared stories that celebrate our diversity;

•conducted an employee engagement survey that gathered feedback on employee experiences with ID&E in the workplace. This feedback is expected to drive our priorities across the Company and within our local plants. The survey included questions about various aspects of ID&E: dignity and respect, belonging and inclusion, diversity, trust, voice, equity and fairness, and psychological safety; and 

•gathered representation data on our salaried and hourly workforce across gender, race/ethnicity, and age characteristics. 

Our future action plans include a variety of activities designed to further our ID&E objectives. These activities may include: (i) sharing our ID&E insights, results, and next steps with employees; (ii) enhancing our inclusive leadership skills; (iii) identifying and communicating our ID&E goals; (iv) celebrating diversity awareness and understanding; (v) finalizing our philanthropy strategy to advocate support for underrepresented communities; (vi) enhancing our supplier diversity strategy; (vii) partnering with colleges, universities, associations, and historically black colleges and universities to attract our next generation of talent; and (viii) incorporating our learnings into global and local changes in human resource, talent, performance, promotion, and recruiting policies and practices. 

At year-end 2021, in the U.S., 28% of our employees identified as female and 38% identified with a historically marginalized group. We believe that it is important to increase representation of women in management and leadership roles in the Company and expect this to be a key commitment for us in 2022 and beyond. While the Company’s racial diversity is comparable to the 2020 Bureau of Labor Statistics, we also see opportunities to increase our race and ethnic representation in leadership roles. Finally, as discussed above, in 2021, we gathered gender, race/ethnicity, and age data to serve as a baseline for future goals, metrics, and actions. 

14
PART I

Equal Opportunity. We are committed to equal opportunity and base workplace decisions solely on merit, qualifications, and other job-related, neutral, non-discriminatory criteria. We provide equal employment opportunity without regard to age, race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, citizenship, pregnancy, religion, disability, military status, genetic information, or other status protected by law. We are committed to providing a harassment-free work environment, and we prohibit retaliation, intimidation, threats, coercion, or discrimination against individuals who, in good faith, complain of unlawful discrimination or harassment. 

Our Workforce Health and Safety

Workforce Health. We are focused on protecting our employees and ensuring a healthy work environment. To respond to COVID-19, we formed a cross-functional crisis response team. Our business leaders manage items such as developing health and safety protocols, responding to health and safety issues, interpreting government orders, and securing personal protective equipment. We developed a comprehensive handbook to set and communicate work procedures and changes to production necessary to facilitate COVID-19 health and safety measures, including proper social distancing. Our business leaders have implemented training and change management initiatives to drive and maintain new ways of operating. When employees test positive for COVID-19, we follow adopted procedures including enhanced disinfecting that targets applicable areas. The affected employee is required to observe an isolation period, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work. Contact tracing is performed to identify employees who had direct contact with the affected employee. If direct contacts are identified, those employees must quarantine, monitor symptoms, and follow medical guidance prior to returning to work.

Workplace Safety. We are dedicated to the safety of our employees through prevention, education, and awareness with the objective of reducing, or even eliminating, workplace injuries through accident investigation and process safety. Our dedicated staff of professionals supports safety management at our manufacturing facilities, including implementation of a comprehensive program called “SafeGuard.” The SafeGuard program develops relevant job hazard analyses, which are undertaken on many processes and used to develop comprehensive job procedures. This allows us to implement job-specific health and safety practices across our business. 

Continuing Education and Training

Developing Our Talent. Although some of our established learning and development programs, as disclosed below, have changed in delivery method due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, developing our talent continues to be part of our ongoing, long-term strategy, which is focused on growing talent, including technical/skilled positions, supervisory and management levels, and future leaders. We believe that people are our greatest asset, and the first step toward building our future and achieving or surpassing our long-term strategic business goals is to enable a culture of employee development at all levels of the Company. This means ensuring that our employees have the tools and resources necessary to execute those business strategies. 

Frontline Supervisor Training Program. The global Frontline Supervisor Training Program is designed to help managers and leaders at manufacturing and distribution locations develop the leadership skills necessary to enhance strong employee engagement. The program stresses communication, leadership, conflict resolution, respect in the workplace, and safety. In 2021, our program successfully trained almost 400 of our global team leaders.

Intern Program. We also have an intern program that is focused on the next generation of Company leaders. In 2021, leadership and developmental workshops for interns included goal setting, personal branding, networking in the workplace, communication and leadership, positive conflict, dealing with criticism, and giving and receiving feedback. Internships are a critical element in our talent pipeline in terms of our ability to recruit professionals early in their careers who will understand what we do in all our manufacturing diversity. Over the last 5 years, the Company has hosted approximately 100 interns in our Doors Internship Program. 

Health and Safety Training. Our manufacturing employees receive new hire safety training, annual refresher safety training, weekly “tool box” talks regarding safety and training, and job-specific safety training based on the jobs hazards analysis developed from our SafeGuard program. 

15
PART I

Succession Development

Management and Leadership Positions. Our commitment to having strong managers and leadership in critical roles across the company continues to serve us well. Our values and culture guide our talent initiatives which are designed to create a pipeline of strong, high performing leadership candidates to serve in progressively important roles throughout the Company. Our internal promotion rate over the last three years for corporate officer positions was 77%. We are building on our success in these areas and continue to push our succession development processes to new levels to allow us to adapt and grow.

As a result of our intentional succession planning and development processes, which included many years of close collaboration, as of January 1, 2022, J. Mitchell Dolloff transitioned to Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Mr. Dolloff succeeded Karl G. Glassman, who had served as Chief Executive Officer since 2016. In addition, in August 2021, J. Tyson Hagale was promoted to Senior Vice President and President of the Bedding Products segment after serving the Company for more than 20 years in various roles of increasing responsibility.

Trends in Market Demand and Competition

Demand Trends for our Products. In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic downturn had a negative effect on the demand for our products and our customers’ products. By mid-second quarter 2020, we began to see rapid recovery in businesses serving home-related and auto markets. This benefited our Bedding, Home Furniture, Flooring and Textile, and Automotive businesses. We ended 2020 with fourth quarter sales in many of our businesses above fourth quarter 2019 levels. In 2021, our trade sales grew 7% compared to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. 

Competition. Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product family, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing, and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price, but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.

 Based on certain industry data, we believe we are the largest U.S.-based manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors, as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically compete in market segments that value product differentiation. However, when we do compete on cost, we typically remain price competitive in most of our business units, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, automation, vertical integration in steel rod and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large-scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. We have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs, and shifting production offshore to take advantage of lower input costs.

For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring, steel wire rod, and mattress imports, please see Competition in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 36.

PART I

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year such as inflation and deflation, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, our operating cash flows are stronger in the fourth quarter, primarily related to the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors. 

Governmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and international laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies or unexpected operational or other developments, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures (including those capital expenditures for environmental control facilities), earnings, and competitive position. 

Internet Access to Information
