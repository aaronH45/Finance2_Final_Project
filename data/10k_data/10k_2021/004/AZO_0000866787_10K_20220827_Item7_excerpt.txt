Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

We are the leading retailer and distributor of automotive replacement parts and accessories in the Americas. We began operations in 1979 and at August 27, 2022, operated 6,168 stores in the U.S., 703 stores in Mexico and 72 stores in Brazil. Each store carries an extensive product line for cars, sport utility vehicles, vans and light trucks, including new and remanufactured automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products. At August 27, 2022, in 5,342 of our domestic stores, we also had a commercial sales program that provides commercial credit and prompt delivery of parts and other products to local, regional and national repair garages, dealers, service stations and public sector accounts. We also have commercial programs in all stores in Mexico and Brazil. We also sell the ALLDATA brand automotive diagnostic, repair and shop management software through www.alldata.com. Additionally, we sell automotive hard parts, maintenance items, accessories and non-automotive products through www.autozone.com, and our commercial customers can make purchases through www.autozonepro.com. We also provide product information on our Duralast branded products through www.duralastparts.com. We do not derive revenue from automotive repair or installation services.

Executive Summary

For fiscal 2022, we achieved record net income of $2.4 billion, an 11.9% increase over the prior year, and sales growth of $1.6 billion, an 11.1% increase over the prior year. Domestic commercial sales increased 26.5%, which represents 28.8% of our domestic auto parts sales. Both our retail sales and commercial sales grew this past year as we made progress on our initiatives aimed at improving our ability to say “Yes” to our customers more frequently and accelerating our commercial growth.

​

Our business is impacted by various factors within the economy that affect both our consumer and our industry, including but not limited to inflation, fuel costs, wage rates, supply chain disruptions, hiring and other economic conditions. Given the nature of these macroeconomic factors, we cannot predict whether or for how long certain trends will continue, nor can we predict to what degree these trends will impact us in the future.

​

One macroeconomic factor affecting our customers and our industry during fiscal 2022 was gas prices. During fiscal 2022, the average price per gallon of unleaded gasoline in the U.S. was $3.83, compared to $2.62 during fiscal 2021. We believe fluctuations in gas prices impact our customers’ level of disposable income. With approximately 11 billion gallons of unleaded gas consumption each month across the U.S., each $1 increase at the pump reduces approximately $11 billion of additional spending capacity to consumers each month. Given the unpredictability of gas prices, we cannot predict whether gas prices will increase or decrease, nor can we predict how any future changes in gas prices will impact our sales in future periods.

​

We have also experienced continued accelerated pressure on wages in the U.S. during fiscal 2022. Some of this is attributed to regulatory changes in certain states and municipalities, while the larger portion is being driven by general market pressures and some specific actions taken recently by other retailers. The regulatory changes are expected to continue, as evidenced by the areas that have passed legislation to increase employees’ wages substantially over the next few years.

During fiscal 2022, failure and maintenance related categories represented the largest portion of our sales mix, at approximately 84% of total sales categories continuing to comprise our largest set of categories. While we have not experienced any fundamental shifts in our category sales mix as compared to previous years, in our domestic stores we see a slight decrease in mix of sales of the discretionary category and a slight increase in the maintence category compared to last year.

The two statistics we believe have the closest correlation to our market growth over the long-term are miles driven and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road.

26 
​

Miles Driven

We believe as the number of miles driven increases, consumers’ vehicles are more likely to need service and maintenance, resulting in an increase in the need for automotive hard parts and maintenance items. While over the long-term we have seen a close correlation between our net sales and the number of miles driven, we have also seen certain time frames of minimal correlation in sales performance and miles driven. During the periods of minimal correlation between net sales and miles driven, we believe net sales have been positively impacted by other factors, including macroeconomic factors and the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road. Since the beginning of the fiscal year and through July 2022 (latest publicly available information), miles driven in the U.S. increased by 4.6% compared to the same period in the prior year. We believe this increase is due to the nation returning to pre-pandemic levels, but we are unable to predict if this increase will continue, due to rising fuel prices, general macroeconomic conditions, or otherwise, or the extent of the impact it will have on our business.

Seven Year Old or Older Vehicles

As the number of seven year old or older vehicles on the road increases, we expect an increase in demand for the products we sell. We expect the aging vehicle population to continue to increase as consumers keep their cars longer in an effort to save money. Additionally, there is increased demand for used vehicles as a result of new vehicle inventory shortages. 

We estimate vehicles are driven an average of approximately 12,500 miles each year. In seven years, the average miles driven equates to approximately 87,500 miles. Our experience is that at this point in a vehicle’s life, most vehicles are not covered by warranties and increased maintenance is needed to keep the vehicle operating.

According to the latest data provided by the Auto Care Association, as of January 1, 2022, the average age of light vehicles on the road was 12.2 years and these vehicles account for more than 40% of U.S. vehicles. The average age of light vehicles has exceeded 11 years since 2012.

Results of Operations

The following table highlights selected financial information over the past 5 years:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

28 
(1) The 52 weeks ended August 28, 2021 and August 29, 2020 were negatively impacted by pandemic related expenses, including Emergency Time-Off of approximately $43.0 million (pre-tax) and $83.9 million (pre-tax), respectively.

(2)  The fiscal year ended August 31, 2019 consisted of 53 weeks.

(3)  Fiscal 2018 was negatively impacted by pension termination charges of $130.3 million (pre-tax) recognized in the fourth quarter and asset impairments of $193.2 million (pre-tax) recognized in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2019 and 2018 also includes a benefit to net income related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of $6.3 million and $132.1 million, net of repatriation tax, respectively. 

(4)  Fiscal 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 include excess tax benefits from stock option exercises of $63.2 million, $56.4 million, $20.9 million, $46.0 million, and $31.3 million, respectively.

(5)  The domestic comparable sales increases are based on sales for all AutoZone domestic stores open at least one year. Same store sales are computed on a 52-week basis. Relocated stores are included in the same store sales computation based on the year the original store was opened. Closed store sales are included in the same store sales computation up to the week it closes, and excluded from the computation for all periods subsequent to closing. All sales through our www.autozone.com website, including consumer direct ship-to-home sales, are also included in the computation.

(6)  The Company adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), beginning with its first quarter ended November 23, 2019 which resulted in the Company recognizing a right-of-use asset (“ROU asset”) and a corresponding lease liability on the balance sheet. 

(7)  26 IMC branches were sold on April 4, 2018. 

(8)  Inventory turnover is calculated as cost of sales divided by the average merchandise inventory balance over the trailing 5 quarters.

(9)  After-tax return on invested capital is defined as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize leases). For fiscal 2019, after-tax operating profit was adjusted for the impact of the average revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, net of repatriation tax. For fiscal 2018, after-tax operating profit was adjusted for impairment charges, pension termination charges and the impact of the revaluation of deferred tax liabilities, net of repatriation tax. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(10) Adjusted debt to EBITDAR is defined as the sum of total debt, finance lease obligations and annual rents times six; divided by net income plus interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense. For fiscal 2018, net income was adjusted for impairment charges and pension termination charges before tax impact. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(11) Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is defined as the change in cash and cash equivalents less the change in debt plus treasury stock purchases. See Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

(12) During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company temporarily suspended share repurchases under the share repurchase program in response to COVID-19 which was restarted beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Fiscal 2022 Compared with Fiscal 2021

For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, we reported net sales of $16.3 billion compared with $14.6 billion for the year ended August 28, 2021, a 11.1% increase from fiscal 2021. This growth was driven primarily by a domestic same store sales increase of 8.4% and net sales of $290.7 million from new stores. Domestic commercial sales increased $885.0 million, or 26.5%, over domestic commercial sales for fiscal 2021.

At August 27, 2022, we operated 6,168 domestic stores, 703 in Mexico and 72 in Brazil, compared with 6,051 domestic stores, 664 in Mexico and 52 in Brazil at August 28, 2021. We reported a total auto parts segment (domestic, Mexico and Brazil) sales increase of 11.0% for fiscal 2022.

Gross profit for fiscal 2022 was $8.5 billion, or 52.1% of net sales, a 62 basis point decrease compared with $7.7 billion, or 52.8% of net sales for fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by the initiatives to accelerate growth in our commercial business.

Operating, selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 increased to $5.2 billion, or 32.0% of net sales, from $4.8 billion, or 32.6% of net sales for fiscal 2021. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of sales was driven by strong sales growth and a decrease in pandemic related expenses.

Interest expense, net for fiscal 2022 was $191.6 million compared with $195.3 million during fiscal 2021. Average borrowings for fiscal 2022 were $5.8 billion, compared with $5.4 billion for fiscal 2021. Weighted average borrowing rates were 3.29% and 3.28% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Our effective income tax rate was 21.1% of pre-tax income for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. The benefit of stock options exercised for fiscal 2022 was $63.2 million compared to $56.4 million for fiscal 2021 (see “Note D – Income Taxes” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). 

Net income for fiscal 2022 increased by 11.9% to $2.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share increased 23.1% to $117.19 from $95.19 in fiscal 2021. The impact on the fiscal 2022 diluted earnings per share from stock repurchases was an increase of $5.27.

Fiscal 2021 Compared with Fiscal 2020

A discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but may be found in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended August 28, 2021, filed with the SEC on October 25, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SECs website at www.sec.gov and at www.autozone.com, by clicking “Investor Relations” located at the bottom of the page.

Quarterly Periods

Each of the first three quarters of our fiscal year consists of 12 weeks, and the fourth quarter consisted of 16 weeks in 2022, 2021 and 2020. Because the fourth quarter contains seasonally high sales volume and consists of 16 or 17 weeks, compared with 12 weeks for each of the first three quarters, our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of our annual net sales and net income. The fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 represented 32.9% of annual sales and 33.3% of net income; the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 represented 33.6% of annual sales and 36.2% of net income; and the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 represented 36.0% of annual sales and 42.7% of net income.

30 
Liquidity and Capital Resources

The primary source of our liquidity is our cash flows realized through the sale of automotive parts, products, and accessories. Continued progress on our initiatives improved our operating performance for the fiscal year. We believe that our cash generated from operating activities, available cash reserves and available credit, supplemented with our long-term borrowings will provide ample liquidity to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support long-term growth initiatives and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. As of August 27, 2022, we held $264.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $2.2 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facility, without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due and fund our share repurchases over the short-term and long-term. In addition, we believe we have the ability to obtain alternative sources of financing, if necessary. 

Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 billion in 2022, $3.5 billion in 2021 and $2.7 billion in 2020. Cash flows from operations are unfavorable compared to last year primarily due to higher inventory purchase volume.

Our net cash flows used in investing activities were $648.1 million, $601.8 million and $497.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2022 was primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures. We invested $672.4 million, $621.8 million and $457.7 million in capital assets in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by our growth initiatives, including hub and mega hub expansion projects and new stores. We had net new store openings of 176, 218 and 138 for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We invest a portion of our assets held by our wholly owned insurance captive in marketable debt securities. We purchased marketable debt securities of $56.0 million, $63.7 million and $90.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had proceeds from the sale of marketable debt securities of $53.9 million, $95.4 million and $84.2 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Net cash used in financing activities was $3.5 billion in fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 and $643.6 million in fiscal 2020. The net cash used in financing activities reflected purchases of treasury stock, which totaled $4.4 billion, $3.4 billion and $930.9 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The treasury stock purchases in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were primarily funded by cash flows from operations. During the year ended August 27, 2022, we repaid our $500 million 3.700% Senior Notes due April 2022 and issued $750 million of new debt compared to none in 2021 and $1.850 billion in 2020. In fiscal years 2022 and 2020 the proceeds from the issuance of debt were used for general corporate purposes.

The Company had net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowing of $603.4 million during fiscal 2022. We did not have any commercial paper or short term borrowing activity during fiscal 2021 and the Company had net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings of $1.0 billion for 2020.

During fiscal 2023, we expect to increase the investment in our business as compared to fiscal 2022. Our investments are expected to be directed primarily to our supply chain initiatives, which includes expanded hub and mega hubs, as well as distribution center expansions and new stores. The amount of investments in our new stores is impacted by different factors, including whether the building and land are purchased (requiring higher investment) or leased (generally lower investment) and whether such buildings are located in the U.S., Mexico or Brazil, or located in urban or rural areas.

During fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 our capital expenditures increased by approximately 8% and 36% and decreased 8%, respectively. Fiscal 2021 capital expenditures increased due to delays in capital spending for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 related to COVID-19.

​

31 
In addition to building and land costs, our new stores require working capital, predominantly for inventories. Historically, we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers, reducing the working capital required and resulting in a high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We plan to continue leveraging our inventory purchases; however, our ability to do so may be limited by our vendors’ capacity to factor their receivables from us. Certain vendors participate in arrangements with financial institutions whereby they factor their AutoZone receivables, allowing them to receive early payment from the financial institution on our invoices at a discounted rate. The terms of these agreements are between the vendor and the financial institution. Upon request from the vendor, we confirm to the vendor’s financial institution the balances owed to the vendor, the due date and agree to waive any right of offset to the confirmed balances. A downgrade in our credit or changes in the financial markets may limit the financial institutions’ willingness to participate in these arrangements, which may result in the vendor wanting to renegotiate payment terms. A reduction in payment terms would increase the working capital required to fund future inventory investments. Extended payment terms from our vendors have allowed us to continue our high accounts payable to inventory ratio. We had an accounts payable to inventory ratio of 129.5% at August 27, 2022 and 129.6% at August 28, 2021. 

Depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments (either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions), we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds and available borrowing capacity to support a majority of our capital expenditures, working capital requirements and stock repurchases. The balance may be funded through new borrowings. We anticipate we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit ratings and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past.

Our cash balances are held in various locations around the world. As of August 27, 2022, and August 29, 2021, cash and cash equivalents of $86.8 million and $80.4 million, respectively, were held outside of the U.S. and were generally utilized to support the liquidity needs in our foreign operations.

For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, our adjusted after-tax return on invested capital (“ROIC”), which is a non-GAAP measure, was 52.9% as compared to 41.0% for the comparable prior year period. Adjusted ROIC is calculated as after-tax operating profit (excluding rent charges) divided by invested capital (which includes a factor to capitalize operating leases). We use adjusted ROIC to evaluate whether we are effectively using our capital resources and believe it is an important indicator of our overall operating performance. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.

Debt Facilities

On November 15, 2021, we amended and restated our existing revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) pursuant to which our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement was increased from $2.0 billion to $2.25 billion and the maximum borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement may, at our option, subject to lenders approval, be increased from $2.25 billion to $3.25 billion. The Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate, and all amounts borrowed will be due and payable, on November 15, 2026, but we may make up to two requests to extend the termination date for an additional period of one year each. Revolving borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be base rate loans, Eurodollar loans, or a combination of both, at our election. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes (i) a $75 million sublimit for swingline loans, (ii) a $50 million individual issuer letter of credit sublimit and (iii) a $250 million aggregate sublimit for all letters of credit.

Under our Revolving Credit Agreement, covenants include restrictions on liens, a maximum debt to earnings ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a change of control provision that may require acceleration of the repayment obligations under certain circumstances.

As of August 27, 2022, we had no outstanding borrowings and $1.8 million of outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement. 

The Revolving Credit Agreement requires that our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of the last day of each quarter shall be no less than 2.5:1. This ratio is defined as the ratio of (i) consolidated earnings before interest, taxes and rents to (ii) consolidated interest expense plus consolidated rents. Our consolidated interest coverage ratio as of August 27, 2022 was 7.4:1.

32 
We also maintain a letter of credit facility that allows us to request the participating bank to issue letters of credit on our behalf up to an aggregate amount of $25 million. The letter of credit facility is in addition to the letters of credit that may be issued under the Revolving Credit Agreement and had an expiration in June 2022. On May 16, 2022, we amended and restated the letter of credit facility to, among other things, extend the facility through June 2025. As of August 27, 2022, we had $23.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under the letter of credit facility.

In addition to the outstanding letters of credit issued under the committed facility discussed above, we had $105.1 million in letters of credit outstanding as of August 27, 2022. These letters of credit have various maturity dates and were issued on an uncommitted basis.

As of August 27, 2022, our $603.4 million of commercial paper borrowings, the $300 million 2.875% Senior Notes due January 2023 and the $500 million 3.125% Senior Notes due July 2023 were classified as long-term in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have the current ability and intent to refinance them on a long-term basis through available capacity in our revolving credit facility. As of August 27, 2022, we had $2.2 billion of availability under our Revolving Credit Agreement, without giving effect to commercial paper borrowings, which would allow us to replace these short-term obligations with a long-term financing facility. 

On January 18, 2022, we repaid the $500 million 3.700% Senior Notes due April 2022, which were callable at par in January 2022.

On March 15, 2021, we repaid the $250 million 2.500% Senior Notes due April 2021 which were callable at par in March 2021.

On August 1, 2022, we issued $750 million in 4.750% Senior Notes due August 2032 under our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on July 19, 2022 (File No. 333-266209) (the “2022 Shelf Registration Statement”). The 2022 Shelf Registration Statement allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store or distribution center openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes.

On August 14, 2020, we issued $600 million in 1.650% Senior Notes due January 2031 under our automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed with the SEC on April 4, 2019 (File No. 333-230719) (the “2019 Shelf Registration Statement”). The 2019 Shelf Registration Statement allows us to sell an indeterminate amount in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes, including repaying, redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt and for working capital, capital expenditures, new store openings, stock repurchases and acquisitions. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of the $500 million in 4.000% Senior Notes due in November 2020 that were callable at par in August 2020.

On March 30, 2020, we issued $500 million in 3.625% Senior Notes due April 2025 and $750 million in 4.000% Senior Notes due April 2030 under the 2019 Shelf Registration Statement. Proceeds from the debt issuance were used to repay a portion of the outstanding commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.

The Senior Notes contain a provision that repayment may be accelerated if we experience a change in control (as defined in the agreements). Our borrowings under our Senior Notes contain minimal covenants, primarily restrictions on liens, sale and leaseback transactions and consolidations, mergers and the sale of assets. All of the repayment obligations under our borrowing arrangements may be accelerated and come due prior to the applicable scheduled payment date if covenants are breached or an event of default occurs. Interest is paid on a semi-annual basis. 

As of August 27, 2022, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under our borrowing arrangements.

For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, our adjusted debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense (“EBITDAR”) ratio was 2.1:1 as compared to 2.0:1 as of 

33 
the comparable prior year end. We calculate adjusted debt as the sum of total debt, finance lease liabilities and rent times six; and we calculate adjusted EBITDAR by adding interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, rent and share-based compensation expense to net income. We target our debt levels to a specified ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR in order to maintain our investment grade credit ratings and believe this is important information for the management of our debt levels.

Management expects the ratio of adjusted debt to EBITDAR to return to pre-pandemic levels in the future, increasing debt levels. Once the target ratio is achieved, to the extent adjusted EBITDAR increases, we expect our debt levels to increase; conversely, if adjusted EBITDAR decreases, we would expect our debt levels to decrease. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.

Stock Repurchases

During 1998, we announced a program permitting us to repurchase a portion of our outstanding shares not to exceed a dollar maximum established by our Board of Directors (the “Board”). On March 23, 2021, the Board voted to increase the repurchase authorization from $24.7 to $26.2 billion. The Board voted to increase the repurchase authorization by $1.5 billion on October 5, 2021, $1.5 billion on December 15, 2021 and $2.0 billion on March 22, 2022, bringing the total authorization to $31.2 billion. From January 1998 to August 27, 2022, we have repurchased a total of 152.5 million shares at an aggregate cost of $30.1 billion. We repurchased 2.2 million, 2.6 million and 826 thousand shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $4.4 billion, $3.4 billion and $930.9 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in purchases of treasury stock for fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due to the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program during fiscal 2020 in order to preserve cash as a result of the uncertainty related to the pandemic. Purchases under the program resumed beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Considering cumulative repurchases as of August 27, 2022, we had $1.1 billion remaining under the Board’s authorization to repurchase our common stock. We will continue to evaluate current and expected business conditions and adjust the level of share repurchases under our share repurchase program as we deem appropriate.

For the fiscal year ended August 27, 2022, cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt was $2.6 billion as compared to $3.0 billion during the comparable prior year period. Cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt is calculated as the net increase or decrease in cash and cash equivalents less net increases or decreases in debt (excluding deferred financing costs) plus share repurchases. We use cash flow before share repurchases and changes in debt to calculate the cash flows remaining and available. We believe this is important information regarding our allocation of available capital where we prioritize investments in the business and utilize the remaining funds to repurchase shares, while maintaining debt levels that support our investment grade credit ratings. Refer to the “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section for further details of our calculation.

On October 4, 2022, the Board voted to authorize the repurchase of an additional $2.5 billion of our common stock in connection with our ongoing share repurchase program. Since the inception of the repurchase program in 1998, the Board has authorized $33.7 billion in share repurchases. Subsequent to August 27, 2022 and through October 17, 2022, we have repurchased 203,856 shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $442.6 million. Considering the cumulative repurchases and the increase in authorization subsequent to August 27, 2022 and through October 17, 2022, we have $3.1 billion remaining under the Board’s authorization to repurchase its common stock.

Financial Commitments

The following table shows our significant contractual obligations as of August 27, 2022:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

(1)Debt balances represent principal maturities, excluding interest, discounts, and debt issuance costs.

(2)Represents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt.

(3)Operating and finance lease obligations include related interest in accordance with ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

(4)Self-insurance reserves reflect estimates based on actuarial calculations and are presented net of insurance receivables. Although these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, the timing of future payments are predictable based upon historical patterns. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of these obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Our tax liability for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, was $43.5 million at August 27, 2022. Approximately $3.3 million is classified as current liabilities and $40.2 million is classified as long-term liabilities. We did not reflect these obligations in the table above as we are unable to make an estimate of the timing of payments of the long-term liabilities due to uncertainties in the timing and amounts of the settlement of these tax positions.

The following table reflects outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of August 27, 2022:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

A substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit (which are primarily renewed on an annual basis) and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers’ compensation carriers.

There are no additional contingent liabilities associated with these instruments as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The standby letters of credit and surety bond arrangements expire within one year but have automatic renewal clauses.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” includes certain financial measures not derived in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). These non-GAAP financial measures provide additional information for determining our optimum capital structure and are used to assist management in evaluating performance and in making appropriate business decisions to maximize stockholders’ value.

Non-GAAP financial measures should not be used as a substitute for GAAP financial measures, or considered in isolation, for the purpose of analyzing our operating performance, financial position or cash flows. However, we have presented the non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe they provide additional information that is useful to investors as it indicates more clearly our comparative year-to-year operating results. Furthermore, our management and Compensation Committee of the Board use the above-mentioned non-GAAP financial measures to analyze and compare our underlying operating results and use select measurements to determine payments of performance-based compensation. We have included a reconciliation of this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the following reconciliation tables.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures of contingent liabilities. In the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we describe our significant accounting policies used in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our policies are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are drawn from historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ under different assumptions or conditions. Our senior management has identified the critical accounting policies for the areas that are materially impacted by estimates and assumptions and have discussed such policies with the Audit Committee of our Board. The following items in our Consolidated Financial Statements represent our critical accounting policies that require significant estimation or judgment by management:

Self-Insurance Reserves

We retain a significant portion of the risks associated with workers’ compensation, general, product liability, property and vehicle liability; and we obtain third party insurance to limit the exposure related to certain of these risks. Our self-insurance reserve estimates totaled $264.3 million at August 27, 2022, and $284.0 million at August 28, 2021. Where estimates are possible, losses covered by insurance are recognized on a gross basis with a corresponding insurance receivable.

The assumptions made by management in estimating our self-insurance reserves include consideration of historical cost experience, judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim and retention levels. We utilize various methods, including analyses of historical trends and use of a specialist, to estimate the cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not yet reported. The actuarial methods develop estimates of the future ultimate claim costs based on the claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. When estimating these liabilities, we consider factors, such as the severity, duration and frequency of claims, legal costs associated with claims, healthcare trends 

38 
and projected inflation of related factors. In recent history, our methods for determining our exposure have remained consistent, and our historical trends have been appropriately factored into our reserve estimates. As we obtain additional information and refine our methods regarding the assumptions and estimates we use to recognize liabilities incurred, we will adjust our reserves accordingly.

Management believes that the various assumptions developed and actuarial methods used to determine our self- insurance reserves are reasonable and provide meaningful data and information that management uses to make its best estimate of our exposure to these risks. Arriving at these estimates, however, requires a significant amount of subjective judgment by management, and as a result these estimates are uncertain and our actual exposure may be different from our estimates. For example, changes in our assumptions about healthcare costs, the severity of accidents and the incidence of illness, the average size of claims and other factors could cause actual claim costs to vary from our assumptions and estimates, causing our reserves to be overstated or understated. For instance, a 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net income by approximately $18.2 million for fiscal 2022. 

Our liabilities for workers’ compensation, general and product liability, property and vehicle claims do not have scheduled maturities; however, the timing of future payments is predictable based on historical patterns and is relied upon in determining the current portion of these liabilities. Accordingly, we reflect the net present value of the obligations we determine to be long-term using the risk-free interest rate as of the balance sheet date.

If the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these reserves changed by 25 basis points, net income would have been affected by approximately $1.2 million for fiscal 2022. 

Income Taxes

Our income tax returns are audited by state, federal and foreign tax authorities, and we are typically engaged in various tax examinations at any given time. Tax contingencies often arise due to uncertainty or differing interpretations of the application of tax rules throughout the various jurisdictions in which we operate. The contingencies are influenced by items such as tax audits, changes in tax laws, litigation, appeals and prior experience with similar tax positions.

We regularly review our tax reserves for these items and assess the adequacy of the amount we have recorded. As of August 27, 2022, we had approximately $43.5 million reserved for uncertain tax positions.

We evaluate exposures associated with our various tax filings by estimating a liability for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement.

We believe our estimates to be reasonable and have not experienced material adjustments to our reserves in the previous three years; however, actual results could differ from our estimates, and we may be exposed to gains or losses. Specifically, management has used judgment and made assumptions to estimate the likely outcome of uncertain tax positions. Additionally, to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or must pay in excess of recognized reserves, our effective tax rate in any particular period could be affected.

​

Vendor Allowances

We receive various payments and allowances from our vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements, including allowances for warranties, advertising and general promotion of vendor products. Vendor allowances are treated as a reduction of the cost of inventory, unless they are provided as a reimbursement of specific, incremental, identifiable costs incurred by the Company in selling the vendor’s products. Approximately 86% of the vendor funds received during fiscal 2022 were recorded as a reduction of the cost of inventories and recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as these inventories are sold.

39 
Based on our vendor agreements, a significant portion of vendor funding we receive is earned as we purchase inventory. Therefore, we record receivables for funding earned but not yet received as we purchase inventory. During the year, we regularly review the receivables from vendors to ensure vendors are able to meet their obligations. We generally have not recorded a reserve against these receivables as we have not experienced significant losses and typically have a legal right of offset with our vendors for payments owed them. We have had write-offs less than $1 million in each of the last three years.
