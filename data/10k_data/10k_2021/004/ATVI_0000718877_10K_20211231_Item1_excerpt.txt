Item 1. BUSINESS

Overview

Activision Blizzard, Inc. is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services. We develop and distribute content and services on video game consoles, personal computers (“PCs”), and mobile devices. We also operate esports leagues and offer digital advertising within some of our content. The terms “Activision Blizzard,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer collectively to Activision Blizzard, Inc. and its subsidiaries. For a discussion of the history of the formation of our Company, including our year and form of incorporation, refer to Part I, Item 1 “Business” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Merger Agreement

On January 18, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) and Anchorage Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Microsoft agreed to acquire the Company for $95.00 per issued and outstanding share of our common stock, par value $0.000001 per share (the “Shares”), in an all-cash transaction. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, following consummation of the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the “Merger”), the Company will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Microsoft. As a result of the Merger, we will cease to be a publicly traded company. We have agreed to various customary covenants and agreements, including, among others, agreements to conduct our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”). We do not believe these restrictions will prevent us from meeting our debt service obligations, ongoing costs of operations, working capital needs or capital expenditure requirements. 

If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain specified circumstances, we or Microsoft will be required to pay a termination fee. We will be required to pay Microsoft a termination fee of approximately $2.27 billion under specified circumstances, including termination of the Merger Agreement in connection with our entry into an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) prior to us receiving stockholder approval of the Merger, or termination by Microsoft upon a Company Board Recommendation Change (as defined in the Merger Agreement), in each case, if certain other conditions are met. Microsoft will be required to pay us a reverse termination fee under specified circumstances, including termination of the Merger Agreement due to a permanent injunction arising from Antitrust Laws (as defined in the Merger Agreement) when we are not then in material breach of any provision of the Merger Agreement and if certain other conditions are met, in an amount equal to (1) $2.0 billion if the termination notice is provided prior to January 18, 2023, (2) $2.5 billion if the termination notice is provided after January 18, 2023, and prior to April 18, 2023, or (3) $3.0 billion if the termination notice is provided at any time after April 18, 2023. The consummation of the Merger remains subject to customary closing conditions, including satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, approval by our stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The Merger is currently expected to close in Microsoft’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2023.

For additional information related to the Merger Agreement, please refer to the preliminary proxy statement previously filed with the SEC and other relevant materials in connection with the transaction that we will file with the SEC and that will contain important information about the Company and the Merger.

Our Strategy and Vision

Our objective is to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment by continuing to be a worldwide leader in the development, publishing, and distribution of high-quality interactive entertainment content and services, as well as related media, that deliver engaging entertainment experiences to our network of connected players on a year-round basis. In pursuit of this objective, we focus on three strategic pillars: expanding audience reach; deepening consumer engagement; and increasing player investment.

Expanding audience reach. Building on our strong established franchises and creating new franchises through compelling content is at the core of our business. We endeavor to expand our network and reach as many consumers as possible by offering our content on multiple platforms, particularly mobile, the largest and fastest growing platform, and delivering compelling experiences across multiple business models (e.g., premium, free-to-play, subscription-based).

4
Driving deep consumer engagement. Our high-quality entertainment content not only expands our audience reach, but it also drives deep engagement with our franchises. We design our games, as well as related media, to provide a depth of content that keeps consumers engaged for a long period of time following a game’s release. In addition, our games are designed to provide players the ability to connect with each other socially within our franchise communities, thus delivering more value to our players and providing additional growth opportunities for our franchises.

Increasing player investment. The connected, online nature of our network enables us to offer content and player investment opportunities directly to our consumers on a year-round basis. In addition to purchasing full games or subscriptions, players can invest in our franchises by purchasing incremental in-game content. These digital revenue streams tend to be more recurring and have relatively higher profit margins. In addition, we generate revenue through offering advertising within certain of our franchises, and we believe there are opportunities to grow new forms of player investment through esports and consumer products. We are still in the early stages of developing these new revenue streams.

Our Segments

Based upon our organizational structure, we conduct our business through three reportable segments, each of which is a leading global developer and publisher of interactive entertainment content and services based primarily on our internally-developed intellectual properties.

(i) Activision Publishing, Inc.

Activision Publishing, Inc. (“Activision”) delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-game and in-game sales, as well as by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Activision products. Activision’s key product franchise is Call of Duty®, a first-person action franchise. Activision also includes the activities of the Call of Duty League™, a global professional esports league with city-based teams.

(ii) Blizzard Entertainment, Inc.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. (“Blizzard”) delivers content through both premium and free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from full-game and in-game sales, subscriptions, and by licensing software to third-party or related-party companies that distribute Blizzard products. Blizzard also maintains a proprietary online gaming platform, Battle.net®, which facilitates digital distribution of Blizzard content and selected Activision content, online social connectivity, and the creation of user-generated content. Blizzard’s key product franchises include: Warcraft®, which includes World of Warcraft®, a subscription-based massive multi-player online role-playing game and Hearthstone®, an online collectible card game based in the Warcraft universe; Diablo®, an action role-playing franchise; and Overwatch®, a team-based first-person action franchise. Blizzard also includes the activities of the Overwatch League™, a global professional esports league with city-based teams.

(iii) King Digital Entertainment

King Digital Entertainment (“King”) delivers content through free-to-play offerings and primarily generates revenue from in-game sales and in-game advertising on mobile platforms. King’s key product franchise is Candy Crush™, a “match three” franchise.

Other

We also engage in other businesses that do not represent reportable segments, including the Activision Blizzard Distribution (“Distribution”) business, which consists of operations in Europe that provide warehousing, logistics, and sales distribution services to third-party publishers of interactive entertainment software, our own publishing operations, and manufacturers of interactive entertainment hardware.

Impacts of the Global COVID-19 Pandemic

In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) emerged and has since extensively impacted global health and the economic environment. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, domestic and international governments around the world enacted various measures, including orders to close all businesses not deemed “essential,” quarantine orders for individuals to stay in their homes or places of residence, and to practice social distancing when engaging in essential activities.

5
During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business experienced an increase in demand for certain of our products and services as a result of the stay-at-home orders enacted in various regions as players had more time to engage with our games. We have, however, seen a moderation in these trends from when the stay-at-home orders were originally enacted early in 2020 and at this time stay-at-home orders have largely been lifted in most regions. It is uncertain how our business could be impacted in the current state of the pandemic as stay-at-home orders in certain regions are reduced, lifted, or at times, fully or partially reinstated, as new cases and variants of COVID-19 arise and evolve.

In an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, the majority of our workforce continues to work from home, and we have placed restrictions on non-essential business travel. During 2022 we expect that our workforce will return to our offices in some capacity while also having the option to continue to work from home depending on business requirements and health and safety concerns. Additionally, thus far, the pandemic has caused minimal disruption to our game titles’ published release dates. Please see “Management’s Overview of Business Trends” section included in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be present and evolve, the impact on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to fully predict at this time, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and associated macroeconomic impacts including labor shortages and supply chain disruption, the speed and effectiveness of regional and worldwide containment and vaccination efforts including vaccine mandates, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, and partners. We will continue to actively monitor the developments of the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that could alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local, or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and shareholders.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on risks and uncertainties regarding the impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, income, revenue, profitability, cash flows, liquidity, and stock price.

Products

We develop interactive entertainment content and services, principally for console, PC, and mobile devices, and we market and sell our games primarily through digital distribution channels. Our products span various genres, including first- and third-person action/adventure, role-playing, strategy, and “match three,” among others. We primarily offer the following products and services:

•premium full-games, which typically provide access to main game content after purchase;

•free-to-play offerings, which allow players to download the game and engage with the associated content for free;

•in-game content for purchase to enhance gameplay (i.e., microtransactions and downloadable content) available within both our premium full-games and free-to-play offerings; and

•subscriptions for players in World of Warcraft that provide for ongoing access to the game content.

Providing additional content and experiences within franchises has increased opportunities for player investment outside of premium full-game purchases. This has allowed us to shift from our historical seasonality to a more consistently recurring and year-round revenue model. In addition, if executed properly, it allows us to increase player engagement with our games and content.

Product Development and Support

We focus on developing enduring wholly-owned franchises backed by well-designed, high-quality games with regular content updates. We aim to build interactive entertainment content with the potential for broad reach, sustainable engagement, and year-round player investment. It is our experience that enduring franchises then serve as the basis for related new products and content that can be released over an extended period of time. We believe that the development and distribution of products and content based on established franchises enhances predictability of revenues and the probability of high unit volume sales and operating profits. We intend to continue development of content based on our owned franchises in the future.

6
We develop and produce our titles using a model in which individual game studios have responsibility for the entire development and production process, including the supervision and coordination of internal and, where appropriate, external resources. We believe this model allows us to deploy the best resources for a given task, including by supplementing our internal expertise with top-quality external resources on an as-needed basis.

While most of our content is developed by our internal studios, we periodically engage independent third-party developers to create content on our behalf. From time to time, we also acquire the license rights to publish and/or distribute software products that are, or will be, independently created by third-party developers.

We provide various forms of product support. Central technology and development teams review, assess, and provide support to products throughout the development process. Quality assurance personnel are also involved throughout the development and production of published content. We subject all such content to extensive testing before public release to ensure compatibility with appropriate hardware systems and configurations and in an effort to minimize the number of bugs and other defects found in the products. To support our content, we generally provide 24-hour game support to players, primarily online.

Marketing, Sales, and Distribution

Many of our products contain software that enables us to connect with our gamers directly. This allows us to communicate and market directly to our customers, including through customized advertising and in-game messaging based on customer preferences and trends. Our marketing efforts also include: activities on online social networks; other online advertising; public relations activities; print and broadcast advertising; coordinated in-store and industry promotions (including merchandising and point of purchase displays); participation in cooperative advertising programs; direct response vehicles; and product sampling. From time to time, we also receive marketing support from hardware manufacturers, producers of consumer products related to a game, and retailers in connection with their own promotional efforts, as well as co-marketing from promotional partners.

Most of our products and content are available in a digital format, which allows consumers to purchase and download the content at their convenience directly to their console, PC, or mobile device through our platform partners, including Apple Inc. (“Apple”), Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”), Google Inc. (“Google”), Microsoft, and Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. (“Sony”). Blizzard utilizes its proprietary online gaming platform, Battle.net, to distribute most of Blizzard’s content and selected Activision content directly to PC consumers.

In addition to serving as a distribution platform, Battle.net offers players communications features, social networking, player matching, and digital content delivery and is designed to allow people to connect regardless of which of our games on Battle.net they are playing.

Our physical products are available for sale in outlets around the world. These products are sold primarily on a direct basis to mass-market retailers (e.g., Target, Walmart), consumer electronics stores (e.g., Best Buy), discount warehouses, game specialty stores (e.g., GameStop), and other stores (e.g., Amazon), or through third-party distribution and licensing arrangements.

Manufacturing

We prepare master program copies for our products on each release platform. With respect to products for consoles, such as for Microsoft and Sony, our disk duplication, packaging, printing, manufacturing, warehousing, assembly, and shipping are performed by third-party subcontractors or distribution facilities owned by us.

Microsoft and Sony generally specify or control the manufacturing and assembly of finished products and license their hardware technologies to us. In return, we pay an applicable royalty per unit once the manufacturer fills the product order, even if the units do not ultimately sell. We deliver the master materials to the licensor or its approved replicator, who then manufactures the finished goods and delivers them to us for distribution under our label.

Significant Customers and Top Franchises

Customers

While the Company does sell directly to end consumers in certain instances, such as sales through Battle.net, in other instances our customers are platform providers, such as Sony, Microsoft, Google, and Apple, or retailers, such as Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and GameStop, who act as distributors of our content to end consumers. 

The percentage of our consolidated net revenues by our most significant customers were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Customer did not account for 10% or more of our consolidated net revenues for the noted period.

No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in the periods above. We had two customers—Microsoft and Sony—who accounted for 20% and 22%, respectively, of consolidated gross receivables at December 31, 2021, and 28% and 21%, respectively, at December 31, 2020. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated gross receivables in those periods.

Top Franchises

For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, our top three franchises—Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and Warcraft—collectively accounted for 82%, 79%, and 72%, respectively, of our net revenues. No other franchise comprised 10% or more of our net revenues in those periods.

Competition

We compete for the leisure time and discretionary spending of consumers with other interactive entertainment companies and software competitors, as well as with providers of different forms of entertainment, such as film, television, social networking, music, and other consumer products.

The interactive entertainment industry is intensely competitive, and new interactive entertainment software products and platforms are regularly introduced. We believe that the main competitive factors in the interactive entertainment industry include: product features, game quality, and playability; brand name recognition; compatibility of products with popular platforms; access to distribution channels; online capability and functionality; ease of use; price of content; marketing support; and quality of customer service.

In addition to third-party software competitors, integrated video game console hardware and software companies, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, compete directly with us in the development of software titles for their respective platforms, while at the same time act as key distribution channels and payment gateways for our products and services through their digital storefronts. Apple and Google are similarly positioned on mobile devices. 

As our teams have contributed to transforming gaming into social experiences, enabling players to find purpose and meaning through games, we believe connecting these communities together is the next step in our industry. This can be seen by established and emerging competitors seeing opportunity for virtual worlds filled with professionally produced content, user generated content and rich social connections. As investments in cloud computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, data analytics, and user interface and experience capabilities are becoming more competitive, we believe that our recently announced merger and partnership with Microsoft will better enable our ambitions in this dynamic and highly competitive environment.

Intellectual Property

Like other interactive entertainment companies, our business is significantly dependent on the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted software code, patented technology, and other technology and trade secrets that we use to develop and run our games. Other intellectual property is in the form of copyrighted audio-visual elements that consumers can see, hear, and interact with when they are playing our games.

We develop a majority of our products based on wholly-owned intellectual properties, such as Call of Duty, Warcraft, and Candy Crush. In other cases, we obtain intellectual property through licenses and service agreements. Further, our products that play on consoles and mobile platforms include technology that is owned by the platform provider and is licensed non-exclusively to us for use in the relevant product. We also license technology from providers other than console manufacturers in developing our content and services. While we may have renewal rights for some licenses, our business is dependent on our ability to continue to obtain the intellectual property rights from the owners of these rights on reasonable terms and at reasonable rates.

We are actively engaged in enforcement of our copyright, trademark, patent, and trade secret rights against potential infringers of those rights along with other protective activities, including monitoring online channels for distribution of pirated copies and participating in various enforcement initiatives, education programs, and legislative activity around the world. For our PC products, we use technological protection measures to prevent piracy and the use of unauthorized copies of our products. For other platforms, the platform providers typically incorporate technological protections and other security measures in their platforms to prevent the use of unlicensed products on those platforms.

Our People

We are committed to becoming the most welcoming, inclusive company in our industry. Genuinely embodying this mission and responsibility to our communities is a powerful lever to attract and retain the very best talent. Our continued success and growth are directly related to our ability to attract, recruit, enable, retain, and develop diverse and innovative talent. 

During 2021, the Company has worked to address concerns raised regarding our workplace and related matters. These concerns have been set forth in, among other contexts, various legal actions against the Company, as described in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Note 22 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leadership of the Company has committed to take action to produce meaningful change and provide employees the resources and support to succeed in our collective aspiration to be the model workplace in our industry.

Steps we have taken to improve our workplace and address concerns include:

•In November 2021, the Board of Directors formed a “Workplace Responsibility Committee” (the “Committee”), initially comprised of two independent directors, to oversee the Company’s progress in successfully implementing its workplace policies, procedures, and commitments. The Committee will require management to develop key performance indicators and/or other means to measure progress and ensure accountability, with executive management providing frequent progress reports to the Committee, which will regularly brief the full Board of Directors.

•For any Activision Blizzard employee who chooses not to arbitrate an individual claim of sexual harassment, unlawful discrimination, or related retaliation arising from events after October 2021, the Company will waive any obligation to do so. 

•We have investigated–and will continue to investigate–complaints of harassment, discrimination and retaliation raised through various reporting channels. In October 2021, we combined our investigations groups into one centralized “investigations unit” within the Ethics & Compliance team. This centralized unit with expanded resources increases our ability to conduct prompt investigations and maintain and measure consistency throughout investigations of all types and across the Company. 

•Our Way to Play Heroes–who are volunteers who help other employees understand reporting options, champion speaking up, and provide feedback and advise on how to strengthen our overall ethics and compliance program– are receiving additional resources and recognition through an overall expansion of the program.

9
•We are committed to continuing to grow our investment in anti-harassment and anti-discrimination training resources.

•We released our U.S. Pay Equity Review 2020 in October 2021. We also released our 2021 Representation Data report in December 2021, based on data in Company records as of November 30, 2021. We believe transparency with our stakeholders is an important part of our mission.

•In October 2021, we announced the launch of a new zero-tolerance harassment policy Company-wide. 

•We launched Upward Feedback in December 2021, an annual process where employees share constructive, actionable feedback to their managers through an anonymous survey, enabling awareness regarding managers’ inclusive behaviors and commitment to living our values.

•We announced a global drug and alcohol policy for Company-sponsored events and zero tolerance for alcohol consumption in the workplace in November 2021.

•We removed content in our games that we believe to be inappropriate. 

While some of these initiatives will have an immediate impact, others may take time to be felt across the Company and will continue to evolve as we gather further feedback from our employees. Additionally, our employees in the U.S. are not covered by collective bargaining agreements. At Raven Software, one of our studios, the Communications Workers of America has filed a petition to represent a unit of employees, and the National Labor Relations Board will oversee the election process, including a determination of the appropriate set of employees who would be included in any bargaining unit (and thus participate in the election on potential unionization). We deeply respect the rights of all employees to make their own decisions about whether or not to join a union and exercise all other National Labor Relations Act rights. Across the Company, we believe that a direct relationship between managers and team members allows us to quickly respond and deliver the strongest results and opportunities for employees. As discussed in Part I, Item 1A under “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, we are also subject to certain interim covenants with respect to various matters (including, among other things, with respect to collective bargaining agreements and employee benefit plans) concerning the operation of our business during the pendency of the Merger.

Other important aspects and areas of focus for the Company to attract, recruit, enable, retain, and develop diverse and innovative talent are set out below:

 Overview: As of December 31, 2021, Activision Blizzard had approximately 9,800 full-time and part-time employees, with approximately 68% in North America, approximately 25% in the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”) region, and approximately 7% in the Asia Pacific region. Of these employees, approximately 68% either work directly on, or support, our game and technology development, which represents an approximate seven percentage point increase from 2020. 

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”): We believe that a culture of inclusion and diversity enables us to create, develop, and fully leverage the strengths of our workforce to exceed players’ and fans’ expectations and meet our growth objectives. We remain committed to building and sustaining a culture of belonging, where our employees can be their authentic selves. By embedding DE&I practices and programs in the full employee lifecycle, we work to attract, recruit, enable, retain and develop diverse world-class talent. Our employee resource groups play an active role in our DE&I efforts by building community and awareness. We also offer leadership and management development opportunities on the topics of unconscious bias and inclusive leadership and train our recruiting workforce in diverse sourcing strategies.

Our Corporate Governance Principles and Policies demonstrate our commitment to diversity at the Board of Directors level, providing that the initial list from which any new independent director nominee is chosen includes qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates and, similarly, if we conduct an external search for a new CEO, that the initial list of external candidates includes qualified female and racially/ethnically diverse candidates. As of December 31, 2021, 20% of the members of our Board of Directors are women, and 20% are members of underrepresented communities. Under current California law, we were required to add an additional female director to our Board of Directors by the end of 2021. To meet this requirement and improve the diversity of our Board of Directors, the Company retained a search firm and began interviewing potential additional female directors in 2021. However, since the Company’s current directors would cease to continue to serve on our Board of Directors upon consummation of our proposed transaction with Microsoft, we were unable to conclude the process in 2021. We will be continuing our efforts to appoint a new female director. 

10
Additionally, since 2016, the number of women in our game development leadership roles has more than doubled. As of November 30, 2021, approximately 24% of our global employee population identifies as women or non-binary, and in 2021, we committed to increase the percentage of women and non-binary employees in our workforce by 50% over the next five years to achieve over one-third representation. Further, upon joining the Company, and again every two years, every employee is required to take our bespoke online Equality & Diversity Training, which underscores our commitment to creating a respectful workplace culture.

Our overall goal in hiring is to provide an objective and equitable process that helps us recruit the very best creative and technical talent in the world and explore an array of resources to increase the share of women, underrepresented ethnic groups (“UEGs”), and other forms of diversity in our workforce.

In 2021 we launched a new tool that tracks–for every single hire–data on the representation and presence of women and UEG candidates at applicant, interview, and hiring stages of our recruiting process. This tool will enable us to provide transparency on our diversity progress as well as helping to reinforce our objective of having diverse candidate slates for open positions.

We also recognize that formal tools and mechanisms around our candidate slates alone will not create the change we strive for in our organization or our industry, which is why we have also prioritized and taken meaningful action on a broad portfolio of initiatives–from expanding opportunities in the gaming and technology space for underrepresented communities to mentorship and sponsorship programs for our current teammates and future leaders. As part of these efforts, we have committed to invest $250 million over the next 10 years in initiatives that foster expanded opportunities in gaming and technology for under-represented communities. Additionally, our work to support the Call of Duty Endowment in 2021 resulted in 16,138 veteran job placements and more than $1 billion in positive economic impact for the veteran community.

Compensation and Benefits: The main objective of our compensation program is to provide a compensation package that attracts, retains, motivates, and rewards employees that operate in a highly competitive and technologically challenging environment. We seek to do this by linking compensation (including annual changes in compensation) to overall Company and business unit/franchise performance, as well as each individual’s contribution to the results achieved. The emphasis on overall Company performance is intended to align our employees’ financial interests with the interests of our shareholders. We continue to make efforts across our global organization to promote equal pay practices. For example, our U.S. analysis showed that women at the Company on average earned slightly more than men for comparable work in 2020. Further, we have announced improved benefits provided to a large portion of our employees, such as increased holiday, sick, and vacation time off. We also have increased our overall investment in development and operations by announcing the conversion of approximately 500 temporary workers to full-time employees at our Activision studios.

We are committed to providing comprehensive benefit options, and it is our intention to offer benefits that allow our employees and their families to live healthier and more secure lives. Some examples of our wide-ranging benefits offered are: 401(k) with matching Company contributions; a comprehensive well-being program; paid leave programs; medical insurance; prescription drug benefits; dental insurance; vision insurance; accidental death and dismemberment insurance; critical illness insurance; life insurance; disability insurance; health savings accounts; flexible spending accounts; and benefits to support current and hopeful parents. We frequently upgrade our benefit portfolio by seeking out pioneer partners that give our employees modern benefit experiences. As an example, at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when traditional medical services became under huge demand, in order to help ensure that our employees and their families had access to medical advice, we created an enterprise-wide global network of physicians. 

Further, the Company has been reviewing our overall compensation structure and philosophy and began implementing changes to our compensation payments for 2021, primarily to enhance employee equity ownership and bring our employee equity compensation in line with current industry practice. As a result of this review, the Company made changes to our 2021 bonus and equity structure so that all eligible employees will receive incentives in the form of Company equity for 2021 in an amount equal to or greater than 2021 target Company performance without regard to whether target performance was achieved. 

11
Developing Careers and Growing Leaders: Recognizing that ours is a rapidly changing industry with constant innovation, developing our diverse and innovative talent base is vital to our business. Our talent processes are focused on performance management, strategic talent assessment and succession planning, and career and leadership development opportunities through promotion and internal mobility. We intend for our employees to have a clear understanding of their strengths and development opportunities, while fostering a collaborative and productive relationship between employees and their managers. Our performance management process begins with the establishment of goals, followed by encouraged regular check-ins on progress and performance so that employees have an understanding of their strengths, areas for improvement, and how they are contributing to the Company. We assess employee contributions to our Company results and culture so that we can recognize and reward their contributions. Additionally, on an annual basis, we conduct an organizational and performance review process with our CEO and all segment, business unit, and function leaders, focusing on our high-performing and high-potential talent, diversity and inclusion, and the performance and succession for our most critical roles.

Engaging Employees: Employees across the Company have the opportunity to join and contribute to one of our nine Employee Networks. These groups enrich our employees’ experiences, our culture, and our business by driving inclusion, cultural awareness, professional development, networking, and community involvement. Employee engagement also plays a critical role in how we identify and improve the way we work. We capture and act on the voice of our employees through multiple means including pulse surveys, listening sessions and newly added upward feedback. We emphasize to employees that this is their chance to “provide honest, candid feedback about their experience working for the Company.” Our employee feedback is dynamic and relevant to our employees’ immediate needs.

Sustainability

We understand that we have a responsibility to operate sustainably. Our ongoing conversion to a more digital business is enabling us to set and achieve important sustainability goals. As a result of this transition, during 2021 we have made significant progress in reducing packaging waste for which, using 2019 as a baseline, we have achieved a 60% reduction, surpassing our original goal of a 50% reduction by 2024. We are also in the process of establishing baselines and setting quantitative interim targets to measure progress towards our goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
