PART I

Item 1.Business. 

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to investors worldwide. We provide an array of U.S. mutual funds, subadvised funds, separately managed accounts, collective investment trusts, and other T. Rowe Price products. The other 

T. Rowe Price products include: open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S. and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. We also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage; trust services; and non-discretionary advisory services through model delivery. We are focused on delivering global investment management excellence to help clients around the world achieve their long-term investment goals. 

The late Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., founded our firm in 1937, and the common stock of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. was first offered to the public in 1986. The T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. corporate holding company structure was established in 2000. 

On December 29, 2021, we completed our acquisition of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., a leading alternative credit manager, and other entities that had common ownership (collectively, "OHA"). We acquired 100% of the equity interests of Oak Hill Advisors, L.P., 100% of the equity interests in entities that make co-investments in certain affiliated private investment funds (the "co-investment entities") and a majority of the equity interests in entities that have interests in general partners of affiliated private investment funds and are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of income (the "carried interest entities") for upfront purchase consideration of $3.4 billion in a combination of cash and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. common stock. The upfront purchase consideration included the retirement of $217.1 million of OHA debt. In addition, the consideration may be increased by up to an incremental $900.0 million in cash as part of an earnout payment starting in early 2025 and ending in early 2027, upon satisfying or exceeding certain defined revenue targets. These defined revenue targets are evaluated on a cumulative basis beginning at the end of 2024, with the ability to extend two additional years if the defined revenue targets are not achieved. The earnout amount will be subject to a proportional reduction if OHA's actual revenue at the end of the earnout period does not meet the defined revenue targets and could result in no earnout payout if OHA's actual revenue falls below 75% of the defined revenue targets. 

The acquisition of OHA included $57 billion of capital under management, of which $47 billion of fee-basis assets under management was added to our assets under management as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition accelerates our expansion into alternative investment markets and complements our existing global platform and ongoing strategic initiatives in our core investments and distribution capabilities. Alternative credit strategies continue to be in demand from institutional and retail investors across the globe seeking attractive yields and risk-adjusted returns.

Over its more than 30-year history, OHA has generated attractive risk-adjusted returns across numerous market cycles. Its fully integrated team specializes in private, distressed, special situations, liquid, and structured credit and real asset strategies in North America, Europe and other geographies. OHA manages private investment funds, collateralized loan obligations ("CLOs") and other private accounts on behalf of a global, largely institutional client base. OHA has over 300 employees with headquarters in New York and primary offices in London, Sydney, Hong Kong, Luxembourg, Fort Worth, and San Francisco. 

Core Capabilities

Our core capabilities have enabled us to deliver excellent operating results since our initial public offering. We maintain a strong corporate culture that is focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance and world-class service to our clients. We distribute our broad array of active investment strategies through a diverse set of distribution channels and vehicles to meet the needs of our clients globally. Our ongoing financial strength and discipline has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities and invest in key capabilities. Our strategic investments have been focused on increasing our investment professional headcount globally, expanding our product offerings, expanding our global distribution footprint to strengthen our regional relationships and brand, and investing in new technology and the core infrastructure of the firm.

The industry in which we operate has been evolving quickly and a number of headwinds have arisen over the last few years, including passive investments taking market share from traditional active strategies; continued downward fee pressure; demand for new investment vehicles to meet client needs; capacity challenges with some of our mutual funds and portfolios and an ever-changing regulatory landscape.

Despite the headwinds, we believe there are significant opportunities that align to our core capabilities. As such, we have been responding with several multi-year initiatives that are designed to strengthen our long-term competitive position and to:

•Maintain our position as a premier active asset manager, delivering durable value to clients.

•Build T. Rowe Price into a more globally diversified asset manager.

•Extend and leverage our retirement expertise globally while becoming an ever more integrated investment solutions provider.

•Embed best practices for sustainability and environmental, social and corporate governance throughout the company.

•Expand our investment capabilities and product offerings, including through our acquisition of OHA.

•Maintain strong processes and internal controls, which is increasingly important with growing business complexity and regulation.

•Remain a destination of choice for top talent, with a culture of diversity, inclusivity, empowerment, accountability and collaboration.

•Deliver strong financial results and balance sheet strength for our stockholders over the long term.

Financial Overview / Assets Under Management

During 2021, we derived the vast majority of our consolidated net revenues and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries, primarily T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International Ltd. Beginning in 2022, investment advisory services provided to OHA-affiliated investment products and vehicles will be included in consolidated net revenues and net income. Previously, in November 2020, we announced our plan to establish T. Rowe Price Investment Management, a separate SEC-registered investment advisor, to support our continued focus on generating strong investment results for clients. T. Rowe Price Investment Management is anticipated to begin operations in March 2022. Subsequent to this date, services related to this investment advisor will be included in our consolidated net revenue and net income. 

Our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of our assets under management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. 

At December 31, 2021, we had $1,687.8 billion in assets under management, including $871.4 billion in U.S. mutual funds, $437.1 billion in subadvised funds and separately managed accounts (including $10.9 billion of OHA separate accounts), $343.3 billion in collective investment trusts and other T. Rowe Price products, and $36.0 billion in private investment funds and CLOs. The acquisition of OHA completed on December 29, 2021 included $57 billion of capital under management (which includes net assets value, portfolio value and/or unfunded capital), of which $46.9 billion of fee-basis assets under management are included in our assets under management as of December 31, 2021. 

Assets under management increased $217.3 billion from the end of 2020. This increase was primarily driven by market appreciation and income, net of distributions not reinvested, of $198.9 billion and fee-basis assets under management of $46.9 billion that was acquired in the OHA acquisition. These increases were partially offset by net cash outflows of $28.5 billion for 2021.

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES.

Distribution Channels and Products

We distribute our products across three broad geographical regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"); and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). We service clients in 50 countries around the world. Investors domiciled outside the U.S., including OHA's clients, represented about 10% of total assets under management at the end of 2021.

We accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels: Americas financial intermediaries, EMEA & APAC financial intermediaries, individual U.S. investors on a direct basis, U.S. retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services, and global institutional investors. The following table outlines the types of products within each distribution channel through which our assets under management are sourced as of December 31, 2021.

Investment Capabilities

We manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity, fixed income, multi-asset, and alternatives across sectors, styles and regions. Our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of investors and are delivered across a range of vehicles. The alternatives asset class includes strategies authorized to invest more than 50% of its holdings in private credit, leveraged loans, mezzanine, real assets, structured products, stressed / distressed, non-investment grade CLOs, special situations, or have absolute returns as its investment objective. Generally, only those strategies with longer than daily liquidity are included. We also offer specialized advisory services, including management of stable value investment contracts, modeled multi-asset solutions, and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from third-party venture capital investment pools.

We employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities. We perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities, management interviews, company-published financials and other information, and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector. Our dedicated, in-house research analysts consider tangible investment factors, such as financial information, valuation, and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental, social, and corporate governance investment factors.

Our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the U.S. and U.K. with additional staff based in Australia, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland. We also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists, political observers, commentators, government experts, and market analysts. Our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling. 

From time to time, we introduce new strategies, investment vehicles, and other products to complement and expand our investment offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace, and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients. We will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period. In 2021, we introduced five new strategies and several new share classes of existing strategies.

We typically provide seed capital for new investment products to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets. The length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product from unrelated investors. We attempt to ensure that the new investment product has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment product's net asset value or its investment performance record. At December 31, 2021, we had seed capital investments in our products of $1.3 billion. 

We may also close or limit new investments to new investors across T. Rowe Price investment products in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors. At present, the following strategies, which represent about 10% of total assets under management at December 31, 2021, are generally closed to new investors: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment Advisory Fees

We provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the U.S. mutual funds; clients on a subadvised or separately managed account basis; collective investment trusts; and other T. Rowe Price products, including funds offered to investors outside the U.S. and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.

Nearly 62% of our investment advisory fees are earned from our U.S. mutual funds, while about 38% of our investment advisory fees are earned from our other investment portfolios. Ten of our 185 U.S. mutual funds - Blue Chip Growth, Capital Appreciation, Growth Stock, New Horizons, Mid-Cap Growth, Large-Cap Growth, Health Sciences, International Discovery, Retirement 2030, and Dividend Growth - accounted for approximately 29% of our investment advisory revenues in 2021, and approximately 22% of our assets under management at December 31, 2021. Our largest client account relationship, apart from the U.S. mutual funds, is with a third-party financial intermediary that accounted for about 7% of our investment advisory revenues in 2021.

U.S. Mutual Funds

At December 31, 2021, assets under our management in the U.S. mutual funds aggregated $871.4 billion, an increase of 9.7% or $76.8 billion from the beginning of the year. Investment advisory services are provided to each U.S. mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the 

T. Rowe Price name. The Boards of the respective funds, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of T. Rowe Price Group (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), must approve the investment management agreements annually. Fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and, generally, either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60-day notice. The termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Independent directors and trustees of the U.S. mutual funds regularly review our fee structures. 

The advisory fee paid monthly by each of the U.S. mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate. For the majority of the U.S. mutual funds, the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate. The tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the U.S. mutual funds. If the combined net assets of these U.S. mutual funds exceed $845 billion, the weighted-average fee across pricing tiers is 28.1 basis points for the first $845 billion of net assets plus 26.0 basis points for net assets in excess of $845 billion. To the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase, the group charge component of a fund's advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease. 

The individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective. Several funds have tiered individual fund rates that reduce their individual flat fee based on certain asset levels of the fund as described in their prospectus. The effective fee rates for each of the stock, bond, and multi-asset funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of $10 million or greater in 2021, varied from a low of 31 basis points for the Short-Term Bond Fund to a high of 104 basis points for the International Discovery Fund. 

The fee rate of several of the U.S. mutual funds, including the Target-Date, Index funds, and Spectrum funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors, does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an all-inclusive fee. An all-inclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and, as a result, our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs. 

Each U.S. mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities. In particular, each fund pays investment advisory fees; shareholder servicing fees and expenses; fund accounting fees and expenses; transfer and sub-transfer agent fees; custodian fees and expenses; legal and auditing fees; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders; registration fees and expenses; proxy and annual meeting expenses; and independent trustee or director fees and expenses.

We usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period. Generally, during the earlier portion of the period, we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses, such as those described above, in excess of these self-imposed limits. During the latter portion of the period, we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs, but such recovery is not assured. 

Additionally, we have contractual management fee waivers for certain U.S mutual funds, including nearly all money market funds, which could occur under certain specified circumstances. Unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds, these waivers will not be recovered by T. Rowe Price in the future. In addition to these contractual fee waivers, due to the low interest rate environment in 2021, we voluntarily waived $57.9 million, or less than 1%, of our investment advisory fees from certain of our money market mutual funds, trusts, and other investment portfolios in order to maintain a positive yield for investors. The firm expects to continue to waive fees through at least the first half of 2022.

Subadvised funds, separate accounts, collective investment trusts, and other investment products

Our subadvised, separate accounts, collective investment trusts, and other investment products had assets under management of $780.4 billion at December 31, 2021, an increase of $104.5 billion from the beginning of the year. This includes $10.9 billion of fee-basis assets under management attributable to separate accounts that were acquired as part of the OHA acquisition. Other investment products include open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S. and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. We earn investment management fees from these clients based on, among other things, the specific investment services to be provided, and these investment management fees are computed using the value of assets under management at a contracted annual fee rate or the products' effective fee rate for those with a tiered-fee rate structure. 

The value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations, end of billing period valuations, or month-end average valuations. In 2021, approximately 79% of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations, 15% were based on end of billing period valuations, and 6% were based on month-end averages. 

Our standard subadvised client accounts normally pay a daily tiered rate and their agreement typically provides for termination with 60 days notice. For separately managed accounts, the fee is generally based on a period ending value and their agreements provide for termination at any time. Unearned fees paid in advance are refunded upon termination. We currently also earn performance-based investment advisory fees on certain separately managed accounts. These fees are currently immaterial to our total investment advisory fees and are only recognized when the performance condition has been met. This recognition criteria can lead to uneven recognition of performance-based revenue throughout the year.

Our U.S. collective investment trusts, sponsored by T. Rowe Price Trust Company and subscribed to by certain qualified U.S. retirement plans, normally pay an all-inclusive tiered rate investment management fee computed on a daily basis.

Our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other T. Rowe Price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with 30 days' notice. The following table details the services provided by certain of our subsidiaries based on our non-U.S. global investment products:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our subsidiaries T. Rowe Price Associates, T. Rowe Price International, T. Rowe Price Hong Kong, T. Rowe Price Singapore, T. Rowe Price Australia and T. Rowe Price Japan, may also provide subadvised investment management services to those global investment products listed in the table above. 

We distribute the products listed in the table above outside the U.S. through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries. The fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the product assets. We currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in distribution and servicing costs.

ADMINISTRATIVE, DISTRIBUTION, AND SERVICING FEES.

Administrative Services

We also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients. These administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, distribution, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in U.S. mutual funds; recordkeeping services for defined contribution

retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex; brokerage; trust services; and non-discretionary advisory services.

T. Rowe Price Services provides the U.S. mutual funds transfer agency and shareholder services, including the staff, facilities, technology, and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders. The U.S. mutual funds contract directly with BNY Mellon to provide mutual fund accounting services, including maintenance of financial records, preparation of financial statements and reports, daily valuation of portfolio securities, and computation of each mutual fund's daily net asset value per share.

T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the U.S. mutual funds, the T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, and funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex. On August 1, 2021, T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services expanded its relationship with FIS, a global technology leader, in which FIS assumed responsibility for managing retirement technology development and core operations for our full-service recordkeeping offering. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services also provides transfer agent services to the U.S. mutual funds. The pricing on these transfer agent services is based on basis points of the related assets under management. Plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the U.S. mutual funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds. As of December 31, 2021, we provided recordkeeping services for $270 billion in assets under administration, of which nearly $163 billion are assets we manage. 

T. Rowe Price Trust Company also provides administrative trustee services. Through this entity, which is a Maryland-chartered limited service trust company, we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products. T. Rowe Price Trust Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans. Our trust vehicles are not mutual funds. As such, trust requirements can result in lower compliance and administrative costs over other vehicles with a similar investment strategy. Our trust vehicles include investments in equity, fixed income and multi-asset assets.

We also provide discretionary and non-discretionary advisory planning services to individual investors through our subsidiary T. Rowe Price Advisory Services, Inc. These services are limited in scope, and advice recommendations consist solely of mutual funds advised by T. Rowe Price Associates or its affiliates that have been selected for inclusion in these services. These services include, but are not limited to, point-in-time financial planning, asset allocation advice, and discretionary advice through a solely digital experience.

Certain T. Rowe Price subsidiaries also provide non-discretionary advisory services to model delivered managed accounts. For these model delivered managed accounts, we provide the holdings and trades of the portfolio to the sponsor platforms to implement for their clients. The assets under advisement in these portfolios, predominantly in the United States, was $8 billion at December 31, 2021. The revenue earned on these services is recorded in administrative fees.

Distribution and Servicing

Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Investment Services ("TRPIS"), is the principal distributor of the U.S. mutual funds and contracts with third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these share classes. TRPIS enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries. The Investor Class of all U.S. mutual funds can be purchased in the U.S. on a no-load basis, without a sales commission or 12b-1 fee. No-load mutual fund shares offer investors a low-cost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and multi-asset strategies. The I Class of certain U.S. mutual funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios. This share class limits ordinary operating expenses (other than interest; expenses related to borrowings, taxes, and brokerage; and any non-extraordinary expenses) to 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external 12b-1 or administrative fee payments. 

Certain of the U.S. mutual funds also offer Advisor Class and R Class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans, respectively. These share classes pay 12b-1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, for distribution, administration, and personal services. In addition, those U.S. mutual funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b-1 fee of 25 basis points.

We believe that our lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles.

Advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of our investment products are recognized when incurred and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential shareholders, as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries. Marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media, television, and digital and social media. Advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest, market conditions, new and existing investment offerings, and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives, including the enhancement of our digital capabilities.

ACQUISITION OF OHA.

Beginning in 2022:

•T. Rowe Price will recognize investment advisory fees related to certain OHA products. OHA provides investment advisory services to private investment funds, CLOs and other private accounts in exchange for an investment advisory fee. Investment advisory fees from private investment funds are determined either monthly or quarterly, and are generally based on the private investment fund’s net asset value or invested capital. Investment advisory fees earned from CLOs include senior collateral management fees and subordinated collateral management fees, which are generally determined quarterly based on the sum of collateral principal amounts and the aggregate principal amount of all defaulted obligations. If amounts distributable on any payment date are insufficient to pay the collateral management fee according to the priority of payments, any shortfall is deferred and payable on subsequent payment dates. Investment advisory fees from private accounts are determined either monthly or quarterly and are generally based upon the net asset value of the account. 

•T. Rowe Price will recognize performance-based fees related to OHA products. In connection with the management contracts from certain private accounts, OHA is entitled to receive performance-based incentive fees when investment returns exceed a certain performance hurdle. In such arrangements, incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved, which is generally measured on an annual basis. Incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration, and as such, these fees are subject to potential reversal up until the end of the measurement period (which is generally one year) when the performance-based incentive fees become fixed, determinable, and are not subject to significant reversal. Incentive fees are generally paid within 90 days of the end of the private account’s measurement period.

•T. Rowe Price will recognize income earned from interests in general partners of certain affiliated private investment funds that are entitled to a disproportionate allocation of income, which is also referred to as carried interest. We will record our proportionate share of the investment funds' income assuming the funds were liquidated as of each reporting date pursuant to each investment fund's governing agreements. A portion of this income will be allocated to non-controlling interest holders and will be reflected as compensation expense in the future.

REGULATION.

All aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and T. Rowe Price product shareholders. They generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed on us, in the event that we fail to comply, include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time, revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations, censures, and fines. Furthermore, the regulations to which we are subject continue to change over time, resulting in uncertainty for our business as we must adapt to new laws and regulatory regimes.

As a global company which offers its products to customers in a variety of jurisdictions, our subsidiaries are registered with or licensed by various U.S. and/or non-U.S. regulators. We are subject to various securities, compliance, corporate governance, disclosure, privacy, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, and economic, trade and sanctions laws and regulations, both domestically and internationally, as well as to various cross-border rules and regulations, and the data protection laws and regulations of numerous 

20

Table of Contents  

jurisdictions, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of the European Union (“EU”). We also must comply with complex and changing tax regimes in the jurisdictions where we operate our business.

The following table shows the regulator to certain of our subsidiaries:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Serving the needs of retirement savers is an important focus of our business. Such activities are subject to regulators such as the U.S. Department of Labor, and applicable laws and regulations including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.

Registrations

•Our subsidiaries providing transfer agent services, T. Rowe Price Services and T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services, are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

•T. Rowe Price Investment Services is a registered broker-dealer and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation. This subsidiary provides brokerage services to our U.S. mutual funds. Pershing, a third-party clearing broker and an affiliate of BNY Mellon, maintains our brokerage’s customer accounts and clears all transactions.

•T. Rowe Price Associates and certain subsidiaries are registered as commodity trading advisors and/or commodity pool operators with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and are members of the National Futures Association. 

Net Capital Requirements

Certain of our subsidiaries are subject to net capital requirements, including those of various federal, state, and international regulatory agencies. Each of our subsidiary's net capital, as defined, meets or exceeds all minimum requirements.

For further discussion of the potential impact of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements, please see the Legal and Regulatory risk factors included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.

COMPETITION.

As a member of the financial services industry, we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. A significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms, broker-dealers, mutual fund companies, banks, and insurance companies. We compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services. Some of these financial institutions have greater resources than we do. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. 

In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies. As a result, such products have taken market share from active managers. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management investment products. 

In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position, we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and, if appropriate, engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationships.

HUMAN CAPITAL.

At T. Rowe Price, our people set us apart. We thrive because our company culture is based on collaboration and diversity. We believe that our culture of collaboration enables us to identify opportunities others might overlook. Our associates’ knowledge, insight, enthusiasm, and creativity are the reason our clients succeed and our firm excels. In order to attract and retain the highest quality talent, we develop key talent and succession plans, invest in Company diversity and inclusion initiatives, provide opportunities for our associates to learn and grow, provide strong, competitive, and regionally specific benefits and programs that promote the health and wellness of our associates, both personally and financially. Our diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives have garnered recognitions, including Pensions & Investments 2020 Best Places to Work in Money Management and Best Places to work for LGBTQ Equality by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. Although we have made progress in our workforce diversity representation, we seek to continuously improve in this area. Our goal is to increase our hiring and the retention and development of talent from groups that are underrepresented in asset management, including both women and ethnically diverse individuals. Pursuant to this goal, each year we establish annual corporate diversity and inclusion goals to continue improving our hiring, development, advancement, and retention of diverse talent and our overall diversity representation. At the end of 2021, women comprised 44.1% of our associates globally. In addition, at the end of 2021, 29.9% of our U.S. associates were racially and ethnically diverse. Furthermore, we are committed to pay equity for employees doing similar work, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity, and we conduct pay equity analyses on a regular basis and adjust our associates pay accordingly. 

At December 31, 2021, we employed 7,529 associates, a decrease of 1.9% from the 7,678 associates employed at the end of 2020. The decrease in the number of associates is directly a result of our expanded relationship with FIS Capital Markets US LLC ("FIS"), which began providing technology development and core operations for our full-service recordkeeping offering in August 2021, and in which approximately 800 T. Rowe Price operations and technology associates transitioned to FIS on August 1, 2021. On December 29, 2021, we added 333 associates as a result of the acquisition of OHA. We may add temporary and part-time personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands, primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services.
