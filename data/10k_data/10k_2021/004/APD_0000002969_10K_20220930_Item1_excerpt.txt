Except as otherwise noted, the description of our business below reflects our continuing operations. Refer to Note 5, Discontinued Operations, to the consolidated financial statements for activity associated with discontinued operations.

During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2022 (“fiscal year 2022”), we reported our continuing operations in five reporting segments under which we managed our operations, assessed performance, and reported earnings: Americas; Asia; Europe; Middle East and India; and Corporate and other. The discussion that follows is based on those operations. Refer to Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements for additional details on our reportable business segments.

Industrial Gases Business

Our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally. Our industrial gases business produces and sells atmospheric gases, such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases, such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide); and specialty gases. Atmospheric gases are produced through various air separation processes, of which cryogenic is the most prevalent, while process gases are produced by methods other than air separation. For example, hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas are produced by steam methane reforming of natural gas and by the gasification of liquid and solid hydrocarbons. For the production of hydrogen, we purify byproduct sources obtained from the chemical and petrochemical industries. Today, we primarily produce hydrogen from hydrocarbons without carbon capture. Our newer energy transition projects are focused on producing clean hydrogen from hydrocarbons with carbon capture (known as “blue hydrogen”) as well as from renewable energy (known as “green hydrogen”). Helium is produced as a byproduct of gases extracted from underground reservoirs, primarily natural gas, but also CO2 purified before resale. The industrial gases business also develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases, such as air separation units and non-cryogenic generators.

The regional segments supply gases, related equipment, and applications in the relevant region to diversified customers in many industries, including those in refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food. Hydrogen is used by refiners to facilitate the conversion of heavy crude feedstock and lower the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuels, as well as in the developing hydrogen-for-mobility markets. We have hydrogen fueling stations that support commercial markets as well as demonstration projects across the globe. The chemicals industry uses hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas as feedstocks in the production of many basic chemicals. The energy production industry uses nitrogen injection for enhanced recovery of oil and natural gas and oxygen for gasification. Oxygen is used in combustion and industrial heating applications, including in the steel, certain nonferrous metals, glass, and cement industries. Nitrogen applications are used in food processing for freezing and preserving flavor, and nitrogen is used for inerting in various fields, including the metals, chemical, and semiconductor industries. Helium is used in laboratories and healthcare for cooling and in other industries for pressurizing, purging, and lifting. Argon is used in the metals and other industries for its unique inerting, thermal conductivity, and other properties. Industrial gases are also used in welding and providing healthcare and are utilized in various manufacturing processes to make them more efficient and to optimize performance.

Industrial gases are generally produced at or near the point of use given the complexity and inefficiency with storing molecules at low temperatures. Helium, however, is generally sourced globally, at long distances from point of sale. As a result, we maintain an inventory of helium stored in our fleet of ISO containers as well as at the U.S. Bureau of Land Management underground storage facility in Amarillo, Texas, and our storage cavern near Beaumont, Texas.

We distribute gases to our sale of gas customers through different supply modes depending on various factors including the customer's volume requirements and location. Our supply modes are as follows:

•Liquid Bulk—Product is delivered in bulk in either liquid or gaseous form via tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Liquid bulk sales are usually governed by three- to five-year contracts.

•Packaged Gases—Small quantities of product are delivered in either cylinders or dewars. We operate packaged gas businesses in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, our packaged gas business sells products (principally helium) only for the electronics and magnetic resonance imaging industries.

•On-Site Gases—Large quantities of hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, carbon monoxide, and syngas are provided to customers, principally in the energy production and refining, chemical, metals, and electronics industries worldwide, that require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. Gases are produced and supplied by large facilities we construct or acquire on or near the customers’ facilities or by pipeline systems from centrally located production facilities. These sale of gas contracts are generally governed by 15- to 20-year contracts. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-site plants (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), typically via a 10- to 15-year sale of gas contract.

Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. Steam methane reformers utilize natural gas as the primary raw material and gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons as the principal raw material for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. We mitigate electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through and tolling arrangements. During fiscal year 2022, no significant difficulties were encountered in obtaining adequate supplies of power and natural gas.

We obtain helium from a number of sources globally, including crude helium for purification from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management's helium reserve. 

The regional industrial gases segments also include our share of the results of several joint ventures accounted for under the equity method. Our share of our investees' net earnings is primarily presented net of income taxes within “Equity affiliates’ income" on our consolidated income statements. The largest of these joint ventures operate in China, India, Italy, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Thailand. The carrying value of our equity method investments is reflected as "Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates" on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Each of the regional industrial gases segments competes against three global industrial gas companies: Air Liquide S.A., Messer, and Linde plc, as well as regional competitors. Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers.

Overall regional industrial gases sales constituted approximately 92%, 92%, and 94% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Sales of atmospheric gases constituted approximately 43%, 47%, and 47% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, while sales of tonnage hydrogen, syngas, and related products constituted approximately 28%, 22%, and 22% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Industrial Gases Equipment

We design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, natural gas liquefaction, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Corporate and other segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation. The equipment is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. The Corporate and other segment also includes our LNG equipment business, our Gardner Cryogenics business fabricating helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers, and our Rotoflow business, which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment. Steel, aluminum, and capital equipment subcomponents such as compressors are the principal raw materials in the manufacturing of equipment. Raw materials for individual projects typically are acquired under firm purchase agreements. Equipment is produced at our manufacturing sites with certain components being procured from subcontractors and vendors. Competition in the equipment business is based primarily on plant efficiency, service, technical know-how, and price, as well as schedule and plant performance guarantees. Sale of equipment constituted approximately 8%, 8%, and 6% of consolidated sales in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

International Operations

Through our subsidiaries, affiliates, and joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, we conduct business in approximately 50 countries outside the United States. Our international businesses are subject to risks customarily encountered in foreign operations, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and controls, tariffs, trade sanctions, import and export controls, and other economic, political, and regulatory policies of local governments described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, below.

We have majority or wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that operate in Canada and approximately 20 countries in Europe (including the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, and the countries of the United Kingdom); approximately 10 countries and regions in Asia (including China, South Korea, and Taiwan); approximately 10 countries in Latin America (including Brazil and Chile); approximately five countries in the Middle East (including Saudi Arabia and Israel), and approximately five countries in Africa. We also own less-than-controlling interests in entities operating in Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.

Financial information about our foreign operations and investments is included in Note 7, Equity Affiliates; Note 21, Income Taxes; and Note 23, Business Segment and Geographic Information, to the consolidated financial statements included under Item 8, below. Information about foreign currency translation is included under “Foreign Currency” in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, and information on our exposure to currency fluctuations is included in Note 12, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below, and in “Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk,” included under Item 7A, below.

Technology Development

We pursue a market-oriented approach to technology development through research and development, engineering, and commercial development processes. We conduct research and development principally in our laboratories located in the United States (Allentown, Pennsylvania), the United Kingdom (Basingstoke and Carrington), Spain (Barcelona), China (Shanghai), and Saudi Arabia (Dhahran). We also fund and cooperate in research and development programs conducted by a number of major universities and undertake research work funded by others, including the United States government.

Development of technology for use within the Industrial Gases business focuses primarily on new and improved processes and equipment for the production and delivery of industrial gases and new or improved applications for industrial gas products.

During fiscal year 2022, we owned approximately 674 United States patents, approximately 3,245 foreign patents, and were a licensee under certain patents owned by others. While the patents and licenses are considered important, we do not consider our business as a whole to be materially dependent upon any particular patent, patent license, or group of patents or licenses.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to various environmental laws, regulations, and public policies in the countries in which we have operations. Compliance with these measures often results in higher capital expenditures and costs. In the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA," the federal Superfund law); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"); and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Our accounting policy for environmental expenditures is discussed in Note 1, Basis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies, and environmental loss contingencies are discussed in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8, below.

Some of our operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHG”), including CO2. These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading System, the California Cap-and-Trade Program, China’s Emission Trading Scheme and its nation-wide expansion, and South Korea’s Emission Trading Scheme. In the Netherlands, a CO2 emissions tax was enacted on 1 January 2021. In Canada, Alberta’s Technology Innovation and Emission Reduction System went into effect 1 January 2020. In Ontario, Environment & Climate Change Canada’s Output Based Pricing System (“OBPS”) was replaced by the GHG Emissions Performance Standards ("EPS") program beginning 1 January 2022. In Singapore, the Carbon Pricing Tax Act was implemented effective 1 January 2019. In Taiwan, Greenhouse Gases Emissions Registration and Verification Management Act will be enforced beginning in 2023. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector to achieve emission reductions, which often result in higher power costs.

Increased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. Although uncertain, these developments could increase our costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production and application of our gasification technology. We believe we will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact these measures will have on our operations. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could negatively impact our growth, increase our operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of our products.

Regulation of GHG may also produce new opportunities for us. We continue to develop technologies to help our facilities and our customers lower energy consumption, improve efficiency and lower emissions. We see significant opportunities for hydrogen for mobility and energy transition, carbon capture technologies, and gasification. 

We estimate that we spent approximately $10 million, $8 million, and $4 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, on capital projects reflected in continuing operations to control pollution. Capital expenditures to control pollution are estimated to be approximately $11 million in both fiscal years 2023 and 2024.

Human Capital Management

As of 30 September 2022, we had approximately 21,900 employees, of which over 90% were working full-time and 62% were located outside the United States. We have collective bargaining agreements with unions and works councils at certain locations that expire on various dates over the next four years. Approximately 17% of our total workforce is covered by such agreements. Overall, we have a corporate strategy supported by our leaders and enabled by a positive organizational culture.

We believe our employees are our most valuable asset and are critical to our success as an organization. Our goal is to be the safest, most diverse, and most profitable industrial gas company in the world, providing excellent service to our customers. Integral to our success is the continued development of our 4S culture (Safety, Speed, Simplicity and Self-Confidence) and creating a work environment where our employees feel that they belong and matter. Our talent-related initiatives, including employee recruitment and development, diversity and inclusion, and compensation and benefit programs, focus on building and retaining the world-class talent needed to execute our two-pillar growth strategy and fulfill Air Products' higher purpose.

Safety

Safety is fundamental to who we are as a company. Safety is a shared value, and our employees’ commitment to safety is demonstrated in many ways every day. Safety is a critical component of everything we do, everywhere in the world. Our goal is to be the safest industrial gas company in the world. 

Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging

Our 2022 Sustainability Report sets forth our announced goals to further increase the percentage of women and U.S. minorities in professional and managerial roles and the recruitment and talent development strategies we have in place to ensure we meet these ambitions. By 2025, Air Products aims to achieve at least 28 percent female representation in the professional and managerial population globally, and at least 30 percent minority representation in that same population in the United States. We established these goals following analysis of our global employee representation metrics and future talent needs, as well as assessing industry benchmarks and peer companies. For more information on these initiatives and to access our most recent Equal Employment Opportunity EEO-1 Report, please refer to our Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging website at www.airproducts.com/company/diversity. The information posted on our website is not incorporated by reference into, and does not form part of, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Compensation

As detailed in our 2022 Sustainability Report, in order to create a diverse workplace, individuals must be compensated fairly and equitably. A work environment where employees know they belong and matter includes fair and equitable pay. Our pay practices apply equally to all employees irrespective of gender, race, religion, disability, age, or any other form of personal difference. We strive to pay competitively in local markets where we do business and compete for talent. We benchmark our compensation to ensure that we are keeping pace with the market to provide competitive pay and benefits. 

Seasonality

Our businesses are not subject to seasonal fluctuations to any material extent.

Inventories

We maintain inventory where required to facilitate the supply of products to customers on a reasonable delivery schedule. Inventory consists primarily of crude helium, industrial gas, and specialty gas inventories supplied to customers through liquid bulk and packaged gases supply modes. 

Customers

We do not have a homogeneous customer base or end market, and no single customer accounts for more than 10% of our consolidated sales. We do have concentrations of customers in specific industries, primarily refining, chemicals, and electronics. Within each of these industries, we have several large-volume customers with long-term contracts. A negative trend affecting one of these industries, or the loss of one of these major customers, although not material to our consolidated revenue, could have an adverse impact on our financial results.

Governmental Contracts

Our business is not subject to a government entity’s renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts that would be material to our business as a whole.
