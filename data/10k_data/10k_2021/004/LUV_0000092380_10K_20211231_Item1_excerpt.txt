Item 1. Business 

Company Overview 

Southwest Airlines Co. (the "Company" or "Southwest") operates Southwest Airlines, a major passenger airline that provides scheduled air transportation in the United States and near-international markets. Southwest commenced service on June 18, 1971, with three Boeing 737 aircraft serving three Texas cities: Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. At December 31, 2021, Southwest had a total of 728 Boeing 737 aircraft in its fleet and 121 destinations in 42 states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and ten near-international countries: Mexico, Jamaica, The Bahamas, Aruba, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Belize, Cuba, the Cayman Islands, and Turks and Caicos. 

During 2021, the Company began service to 14 new destinations including Chicago (O'Hare), Illinois; Houston (Bush), Texas; Jackson, Mississippi; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Savannah, Georgia/Hilton Head, South Carolina; Sarasota, Florida; Santa Barbara, California; Fresno, California; Destin, Florida; Bozeman, Montana; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Eugene, Oregon; Bellingham, Washington; and Syracuse, New York.

Worldwide Pandemic

In March 2020, the World Health Organization classified the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, as a pandemic. The speed with which the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the U.S. economic landscape, outlook, and in particular the travel industry, was swift and unexpected and resulted in a significant negative impact on travel demand, revenues, and bookings throughout 2020. The Company responded by cancelling a significant portion of its scheduled flights, grounding a significant portion of its fleet, significantly reducing planned capital spending, and significantly reducing its previously scheduled capacity. Further, the Company substantially enhanced its cash holdings by obtaining significant financing in the capital markets, through payroll funding support ("Payroll Support") with the U.S. Department of Treasury ("Treasury"), and elsewhere. In addition, the Company offered voluntary separation and extended time-off programs for its Employees, which significantly reduced the Company's active headcount. 

The Company continued to experience negative and unpredictable fluctuating pandemic-related impacts to passenger demand and bookings in 2021. Modest improvements in leisure bookings began in mid-February 2021 and further improved in March 2021. Travel demand and bookings accelerated during second quarter 2021 as a result of declining reported COVID-19 cases throughout the United States, the easing of travel restrictions, and an increase in the number of individuals vaccinated. Despite some softness in bookings and elevated trip cancellations due to surging COVID-19 cases in August and September as a result of the Delta variant, and in December as a result of the Omicron variant, third quarter and fourth quarter 2021 domestic leisure demand was also strong and a dramatic improvement from 2020.

The unpredictable fluctuating extent of the travel demand improvement over the course of 2021, combined with the reduction in the Company's available workforce, contributed to operational challenges and resulting declines in the Company's operational performance as the Company struggled to return to the staffing levels necessary for operational demands. In response, the Company continued its efforts to correspondingly adjust capacity throughout 2021 and into first quarter 2022. In addition, the Company aggressively hired new Employees in third and fourth quarter 2021, and is continuing these efforts in 2022, to balance its schedule with its crew and ground operations resources.

For further information on risks related to COVID-19, as well as the significant impacts of COVID-19 on the Company's operations, financial performance, and liquidity, see "Risk Factors," "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Notes 2, 7, and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Industry

As discussed above under "Business – Worldwide Pandemic," the travel industry was adversely impacted in 2020 and 2021 by the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent Delta and Omicron variants. Like the Company, other U.S. airlines experienced significant negative impacts to passenger demand and revenues; however the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some of these airlines was particularly severe because of the percentage of their operations that had historically been dependent on business and international travel, each of which suffered particular harm as a result of the pandemic. Demand for business travel declined significantly due to companies tightening or even suspending corporate travel. This not only reduced overall demand for air travel, but also resulted in a decrease in the percentage of full-fare purchases. Demand for international travel was significantly harmed by the imposition of international travel restrictions. Like the Company, these other airlines responded with adjustments to their flight schedules, capacity, operating costs and capital expenditures, and fleet plans. Unlike the Company, certain other airlines also furloughed employees and/or ceased service in certain markets. 

Like the Company, other U.S. airlines began to mitigate cash losses and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, while facing challenges such as the Delta and Omicron variants, lower passenger revenue yields (i.e., pricing), higher fuel prices and other cost inflation, and surges in leisure travel demand against constrained personnel resources resulting in operational challenges. Overall, the U.S. airline industry saw a strong recovery of domestic leisure travel demand during peak travel periods in 2021 as a result of declining reported COVID-19 cases throughout the United States, the easing of travel restrictions, and an increase in the number of individuals vaccinated against COVID-19. However, business travel remained at a significantly reduced level throughout 2021, as compared with pre-pandemic levels.

The airline industry has historically been an extremely volatile industry subject to numerous other challenges. Among other things, it has been cyclical, energy intensive, labor intensive, capital intensive, technology intensive, highly regulated, heavily taxed, and extremely competitive. The airline industry has also been particularly susceptible to detrimental events such as economic recessions, jet fuel price volatility, unscheduled maintenance disruptions, U.S. government shutdowns, acts of terrorism, poor weather, and natural disasters.

Historically, airline industry results have been particularly susceptible to fuel price volatility. In 2021, the industry experienced a very challenging fuel environment, as compared with recent years, with year-over-year fuel prices significantly higher throughout most of 2021.

Company Operations

Route Structure

Southwest has historically principally provided point-to-point service, rather than the "hub-and-spoke" service provided by most major U.S. airlines. The hub-and-spoke system concentrates most of an airline's operations at a limited number of central hub cities and serves most other destinations in the system by providing one-stop or connecting service through a hub. By not concentrating operations through one or more central transfer points, Southwest's point-to-point route structure has allowed for more direct nonstop routing than hub-and-spoke service. However, in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company placed greater reliance in 2020 and 2021 on connecting traffic in an effort to capture Customer demand. Approximately 73 percent of the Company's Customers flew nonstop during 2021, compared with 72 percent during 2020, and compared with 77 percent during 2019, and, as of December 31, 2021, Southwest served 788 nonstop city pairs, compared with 667 as of December 31, 2020, and compared with 720 as of December 31, 2019. For 2021, the Company’s average aircraft trip stage length was 790 miles, with an average duration of approximately 2.1 hours, as compared with an average aircraft trip stage length of 743 miles and an average duration of approximately 2.0 hours in 2020, and as compared with an average aircraft trip stage length of 748 miles and an average duration of approximately 2.0 hours in 2019.

Southwest’s point-to-point service has also enabled it to provide its markets with frequent, conveniently timed flights and low fares. For example, Southwest currently offers ten weekday roundtrips between Dallas Love Field and Houston Hobby (and an additional six to Houston Bush), seven weekday roundtrips between Denver and Chicago Midway (and an additional six to Chicago O'Hare), seven weekday roundtrips between Los Angeles International and Las Vegas, twelve weekday round trips between Burbank and Oakland, and nine weekday roundtrips between Phoenix and Denver. Southwest complements its high-frequency short-haul routes with long-haul nonstop service including flights between Hawaii and California, Las Vegas, and Phoenix, and between markets such as Los Angeles and Nashville, Los Angeles and Baltimore, Oakland and Houston, Las Vegas and Orlando, and San Diego and Baltimore.

The Company continually works to optimize its route network and schedule through the adjustment of frequencies in its existing markets and the addition of new markets and itineraries, while also pruning less profitable flights from its schedule. The Company's network and schedule optimization efforts have been particularly beneficial in addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, these efforts have enabled the Company to continue to add cities in key existing markets, such as California, as well as opportunistically introduce service in other markets during the pandemic. As part of the Company's recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company remains focused on restoring its network to pre-pandemic levels through adding back depth and frequency to the Company's network while balancing its network schedule with its crew resources.

Despite the pandemic, the Company has been able to continue to bolster its presence in California through the addition of new destination options and flights for California Customers. In 2021, the Company added many new destinations to its route map, including new California service to Santa Barbara and Fresno. Further, the Company expanded its California to Hawaii network in 2021 by adding inaugural service between Los Angeles and Hawaii in June 2021. The Company also added inaugural service to Hawaii from Las Vegas and Phoenix in June 2021. The Company also expanded its service at John Wayne Airport (Orange County) in 2021, including reinstated international service beginning in March 2021. In addition, the Company is currently scheduled to offer over 700 departures from California on peak flying days in the summer of 2022. Based on the most recent data available from the U.S. Department of Transportation (the "DOT"), for the year ended September 30, 2021, Southwest carried more California travelers to, from, and within California than any other airline. 

The Company's network and schedule optimization efforts have also enabled it to use otherwise idle aircraft, while overall travel demand has been reduced. This, in turn, has enabled the Company to better optimize its service amongst its core markets and, in 2021, it enabled the Company to provide service to 14 new destinations. The additional service has created additional regional and international connectivity that has been structured to grow the Company's presence in strategic markets that serve as cornerstones for its network and provide additional options for Customers to reach their final destinations. The Company expects to complement and strengthen its existing route network in or near cities where its Customer base is large, along with adding easier access to popular leisure-oriented destinations. 

The COVID-19 pandemic had a particularly negative impact on the Company's international operations and led to the Company's suspension of international operations at the beginning of the pandemic. The Company has since resumed service to 13 of its 14 international destinations. The Company’s operations to the Cayman Islands are temporarily suspended due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the easing of government restrictions and the continued increase in demand for beach and leisure destinations, the Company intends to resume service to the Cayman Islands in 2022.

Boeing 737 MAX

In March 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (the "FAA") issued an emergency order for all U.S. airlines to ground all Boeing 737 MAX ("MAX") aircraft. The Company immediately complied with the order and grounded all 34 Boeing 737 MAX 8 ("-8") aircraft in its fleet. In November 2020, the FAA rescinded the emergency order and issued official requirements to enable U.S. airlines to return the MAX to service. The Company returned the MAX to service in March 2021, after the Company met all FAA requirements and Pilots received updated, MAX-

related training. Following the FAA rescission of the emergency order, the Company took delivery of 35 -8 aircraft through the end of 2021 and had 69 -8 aircraft in its fleet at 2021 year-end.

During 2021, the Company entered into supplemental agreements with The Boeing Company ("Boeing") to increase its 2022 firm orders of Boeing 737 MAX 7 ("-7") aircraft, accelerate options into 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025, and add new options in 2026 and 2027, in each case with the goal of improving potential growth opportunities, restoring the Company's network closer to pre-pandemic levels, lowering operating costs, reducing carbon emissions per available seat mile, and further modernizing the Company's fleet with more fuel efficient aircraft. Additionally, during 2021, the Company exercised 42 2022 options for -7 aircraft and exercised 22 2023 options for -7 aircraft. Fleet and capacity plans will continue to evolve as the Company manages through the pandemic recovery period, and the Company will continue to evaluate its remaining MAX options. However, with its cost-effective order book, the Company retains significant flexibility to manage its fleet size, including opportunities to accelerate fleet modernization efforts if growth opportunities do not materialize. The Company continues to plan for 30-35 Boeing 737-700 retirements annually. Additional information regarding the Company's current fleet and fleet delivery schedule is included in "Item 2 – Properties" below. The delivery schedule for the -7 is dependent on the FAA issuing required certifications and approvals to Boeing and the Company. The FAA will ultimately determine the timing of the -7 certification and entry into service, and the Company therefore offers no assurances that current estimations and timelines are correct. 

Cost Structure

A key component of the Company's business strategy is its focus on cost discipline and charging competitively low fares. The Company's low-cost strategy includes, among other elements, (i) the use of a single aircraft type, the Boeing 737, (ii) the Company's point-to-point route structure, and (iii) its highly productive Employees. Southwest's use of a single aircraft type has historically allowed for simplified scheduling, maintenance, flight operations, safety management, and training activities. Southwest's point-to-point route structure includes service to and from many secondary or downtown airports such as Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby, Chicago Midway, Baltimore-Washington International, Burbank, Manchester, Oakland, San Jose, Providence, and Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood. These conveniently located airports are typically less congested than other airlines' hub airports, which has contributed to Southwest's ability to achieve high asset utilization because aircraft can be scheduled to minimize the amount of time they are on the ground. This, in turn, has reduced the number of aircraft and gate facilities that would otherwise be required and allows for high Employee productivity (lower headcount per aircraft).

The Company's focus on controlling costs also includes a continued commitment to pursuing, implementing, and enhancing initiatives to reduce fuel consumption and improve fuel efficiency. The Company focuses on minimizing fuel consumption and improving fuel efficiency through fleet modernization and other fuel initiatives. For example, in 2021 the Company returned its -8 aircraft to service, which are more fuel-efficient and release fewer CO2 emissions per available seat mile than the Company's other aircraft.

Fuel and oil expense can be extremely volatile and unpredictable, and even a small change in market fuel prices can significantly affect profitability. Fuel and oil expense for 2021 increased significantly compared with 2020, primarily due to higher market jet fuel prices, and in part due to higher capacity in response to consumer demand. Fuel and oil expense remained the Company's second largest operating cost for 2021. As evidenced by the table below, energy prices can fluctuate significantly in a relatively short amount of time. The table below shows the Company's average cost of jet fuel for each year beginning in 2011 and during each quarter of 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The MAX groundings in early 2019 resulted in the removal of these more fuel-efficient aircraft from the Company's schedule, which, in turn, drove a decline in the Company's overall fuel efficiency in 2019. Although the Company's MAX aircraft remained grounded throughout 2020, the Company improved its fuel efficiency in 2020, as compared with 2019, primarily by operating fewer of its oldest, least fuel-efficient Boeing 737-700 aircraft as a result of capacity cuts in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Lower load factors, due to COVID-19, also contributed to fuel efficiency during 2020. Despite the return to service of the MAX aircraft, the Company's 2021 fuel efficiency declined, as compared with 2020, due to higher load factors and the Company's return to service of more of its oldest, least fuel efficient Boeing 737-700 aircraft, which had been placed into storage in 2020 due to capacity cuts in response to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company continues to undertake a number of other fuel conservation initiatives, which are discussed in detail under "Environmental Sustainability."

The table below sets forth the Company's available seat miles produced per fuel gallon consumed over the last five years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company also enters into fuel derivative contracts to manage its risk associated with significant increases in fuel prices. The Company's fuel hedging activities, as well as the risks associated with high and/or volatile fuel prices, are discussed in more detail below under "Risk Factors," "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Salaries, wages, and benefits expense constituted approximately 55.0 percent of the Company's operating expenses during 2021 and was the Company's largest operating cost. The Company's ability to control labor costs is limited by the terms of its collective-bargaining agreements, and increased labor costs have negatively impacted the Company's low-cost competitive position. The Company's labor costs, and risks associated therewith, are discussed

in more detail below under "Risk Factors," "Business - Employees," and "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

Fare Structure

General

Southwest offers a relatively simple fare structure that features competitive fares and product benefits, including unrestricted fares, as well as lower fares available on a restricted basis. Southwest fare products include three major categories: "Wanna Get Away®," "Anytime," and "Business Select®," to provide Customers options when choosing a fare. All fare products include the privilege of two free checked bags (weight and size limits apply). Southwest does not charge fees for changes to flight reservations although fare differences may apply.

•"Wanna Get Away" fares are generally the lowest fares and are typically subject to advance purchase requirements. They are nonrefundable, but, subject to Southwest's No Show Policy, flight credit for the fare paid for unused travel by the Customer ("flight credit") may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. Wanna Get Away fares earn six Rapid Rewards® points, under Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program, for each dollar spent on the base fare. The Company's loyalty program is discussed below under "Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program."

•"Anytime" fares are, subject to Southwest's No Show Policy, refundable if canceled, or flight credit may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. If this fare is purchased with nonrefundable flight credit, then the resulting flight credit will be nonrefundable if travel is canceled. Anytime fares earn 10 Rapid Rewards points for each dollar spent on the base fare.

•"Business Select" fares are, subject to Southwest's No Show Policy, refundable if canceled, or flight credit may be applied towards future travel on Southwest. If this fare is purchased with nonrefundable flight credit, then the resulting flight credit will be nonrefundable if travel is canceled. Business Select fares also include additional perks such as priority boarding with a boarding position in the first 15 boarding positions within boarding group "A," 12 Rapid Rewards points per dollar spent on the base fare - the highest loyalty point multiplier of all Southwest fare products, and "Fly By®" priority security and/or ticket counter access in participating airports. Business Select fares also ordinarily include one complimentary premium beverage coupon for the day of travel (Customers must be of legal drinking age to drink alcoholic beverages); however, the Company has temporarily suspended premium drink service in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Southwest's No Show Policy applies if a Customer does not change or cancel a flight segment at least ten minutes prior to scheduled departure and the Customer does not travel on the scheduled flight. In such event, subject to certain exceptions, all segments associated with the reservation will be canceled, and (i) with respect to a "Wanna Get Away" fare, the fare paid for unused travel will be forfeited; and (ii) with respect to an "Anytime" or "Business Select" fare, the fare paid for unused travel will be held as a flight credit for future travel on Southwest.

The Company has announced plans to add a new, fourth fare product that enhances the overall product offering for Customers. The Company also currently plans to increase benefits tied to existing fare product categories at various times in the future. The anticipated launch date for the new fare product is during second quarter 2022. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to enhance and expand upon its already generous and flexible ticketing policies, the Company extended the expiration of the following Customer flight credits to September 7, 2022:

•Flight credits created because of a flight cancellation between March 1, 2020 and September 7, 2020; and

•Flight credits that would have expired between March 1, 2020 and September 7, 2020.

Ancillary Services

The Company offers ancillary services such as Southwest's EarlyBird Check-In®, Upgraded Boarding, and transportation of pets and unaccompanied minors, in accordance with Southwest's respective policies.

EarlyBird Check-In provides Customers with automatic check-in and an assigned boarding position before general boarding positions become available, thereby improving Customers' seat selection options (priority boarding privileges are already a benefit of being an "A-List" tier member under the Company's Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program). The Company has implemented a variable pricing model for EarlyBird Check-In based on the length of the flight and the historical popularity of EarlyBird Check-In on the route.

When available, Southwest sells Upgraded Boarding at the airport, which allows a Customer to pay for an open priority boarding position in the first 15 positions in its "A" boarding group.

Southwest’s Pet Policy provides Customers an opportunity to travel with a small cat or dog in the aircraft cabin on domestic flights. Southwest also has an unaccompanied minor travel policy, with pricing to address the administrative costs and the extra care necessary to safely transport these Customers.

 Inflight Entertainment Portal and WiFi Service

Southwest offers inflight entertainment and connectivity service on WiFi-enabled aircraft on the majority of its fleet, where available. Southwest's suite of complimentary offerings onboard WiFi-enabled aircraft includes movies-on-demand, messaging, music, live and on-demand television, a flight tracker, and connecting flight information. The inflight entertainment service allows Customers to enjoy gate-to-gate entertainment directly on their personal wireless devices. Customers can also purchase satellite internet service while on WiFi-enabled aircraft, where available.

The free inflight entertainment offerings include approximately 45 free movies-on-demand each month and free app messaging via iMessage or WhatsApp. The television product consists of over 15 live channels and up to 75 on-demand recorded episodes from popular television series. In addition, the onboard entertainment portal offers free digital music and live streaming radio service to Customers within the onboard entertainment portal.

Rapid Rewards Loyalty Program

Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program enables program members ("Members") to earn points for every dollar spent on Southwest base fares, also including purchases paid with LUV Vouchers, gift cards, or flight credit, with no portion of the purchase price paid with Rapid Rewards points. The amount of points earned under the program is based on the base fare and fare class purchased, with higher fare products (e.g., Business Select) earning more points than lower fare products (e.g., Wanna Get Away). As discussed above under "Fare Structure - General," each fare class is associated with a points earning multiplier, and points for flights are calculated by multiplying the base fare for the flight by the fare class multiplier. The amount of points required to be redeemed for a flight is based on the base fare and a multiplier. Under the program, (i) Members are able to redeem their points for every available seat, every day, on every flight, with no blackout dates; and (ii) points do not expire.

Under the program, Members continue to accumulate points until the time they decide to redeem them. As a result, the program provides Members significant flexibility and options for earning and redeeming rewards. For example, Members can earn more points (and/or achieve tiered status such as A-List and Companion Pass faster) by purchasing higher fare tickets. Members also have significant flexibility in redeeming points, such as the opportunity to book in advance to take advantage of a lower fare ticket (including many fare sales) and redeem fewer points or by being able to redeem more points and book at the last minute if seats are still available for sale. Members can also earn points through qualifying purchases with Rapid Rewards Partners (which include, for example, car rental agencies, hotels, and restaurants), as well as by using Southwest's co-branded Chase® Visa credit card. In addition to earning points for revenue flights and qualifying purchases with Rapid Rewards Partners, 

9
Members also have the ability to purchase, gift, and transfer points, as well as the ability to donate points to selected charities.

Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program features tier status and Companion Pass programs for the most active Members, including "A-List" and "A-List Preferred" status. A Member who flies 25 qualifying one-way flight segments booked through Southwest or earns 35,000 tier qualifying points per calendar year will qualify for A-List status. A Member who flies 50 qualifying one-way flights booked through Southwest or earns 70,000 tier qualifying points per calendar year will qualify for A-List Preferred status. Except as noted below with respect to actions taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Member will maintain A-List or A-List Preferred status for the remainder of the calendar year in which the status is earned and for the entire calendar year immediately following. Both A-List and A-List Preferred Members enjoy benefits such as "Fly By®" priority check-in and security lane access, where available, as well as dedicated phone lines, standby priority, and an earnings bonus on eligible revenue flights (25 percent for A-List and 100 percent for A-List Preferred). In addition, A-List Preferred Members enjoy free inflight satellite internet service on WiFi-enabled aircraft, where available. Members who attain A-List or A-List Preferred status receive priority boarding privileges. When these Customers purchase travel at least 36 hours prior to flight time, they receive the best boarding position available (generally, an "A" boarding pass). During the day of travel, if an A-List or A-List Preferred Member's plans change, they have free same-day standby privileges, which allow them to fly on earlier flights between the same city pairs if space is available, but are required to pay any additional government taxes and fees associated with changes in their itinerary. Another feature of the Rapid Rewards loyalty program is the Companion Pass. Members who fly 100 qualifying one-way flights or earn 125,000 qualifying points in a calendar year automatically receive a Companion Pass, which provides for unlimited travel for the designated Companion free of charges (other than taxes and fees). Except as noted below with respect to actions taken by the Company in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Companion Pass is valid for the remainder of the calendar year in which status is earned and for the following full calendar year to any destination available on Southwest for a designated Companion of the qualifying Member. The Member and designated Companion must travel together on the same flight.

During 2021, the Company added Rapid Rewards Business, giving businesses the ability to earn Rapid Rewards points. By joining Rapid Rewards Business, companies earn Rapid Rewards points that can be applied toward travel on the company's behalf, while travelers who are Rapid Rewards Members also earn Rapid Rewards points in their personal accounts. Rapid Rewards business accounts generally have the same opportunities and benefits to earn and redeem points as individual Member accounts.

Southwest's Rapid Rewards loyalty program has been designed to drive more revenue by (i) bringing in new Customers, including new Members, as well as new holders of Southwest's co-branded Chase Visa credit card; (ii) increasing business from existing Customers; and (iii) strengthening the Company's Rapid Rewards hotel, rental car, credit card, and other partnerships.

For 2021, Customers of Southwest redeemed approximately 8.1 million flight awards, accounting for approximately 17.3 percent of revenue passenger miles flown. For 2020, Customers of Southwest redeemed approximately 4.1 million flight awards, accounting for approximately 15.8 percent of revenue passenger miles flown. For 2019, Customers of Southwest redeemed approximately 10.7 million flight awards, accounting for approximately 14.1 percent of revenue passenger miles flown. The Company's accounting policies with respect to its loyalty programs are discussed in more detail in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The Company has taken significant measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance its Rapid Rewards loyalty program including the following:

•For A-List and A-List Preferred Members who earned tier status in 2020, earned status was extended through December 31, 2021; and

•For Companion Pass Members who earned Companion Pass benefits to be used through December 2020, Companion Pass benefits were extended through June 30, 2021.

10
Additionally, in January 2021, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company made additional changes that affected tier status as well as Companion Pass eligibility, all with the intention of enhancing the Company's Rapid Rewards loyalty program and its Members’ experiences:

•All Rapid Rewards Members with valid Rapid Rewards accounts as of December 31, 2020, received a “boost” of 15,000 tier qualifying points and 10 flight credits toward A-List and A-List Preferred status, and 25,000 Companion Pass qualifying points and 25 flight credits toward Companion Pass status;

•Through December 31, 2021, for Members with Southwest's co-branded Chase® Visa Premier or Priority Consumer credit cards, or Premier or Performance Business credit cards, for every $10,000 in spend on their credit cards, they were eligible for 1,500 Tier Qualifying Points (with no cap); and

•For Companion Pass Members who earned Companion Pass benefits to be used through December 2020, which were previously extended through June 30, 2021, those Companion Pass benefits were further extended through December 31, 2021.

Southwest.com and Direct to Customer Distribution Approach

The Company primarily offers its fare products directly to Customers through its Internet website, Southwest.com. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, approximately 86 percent and 83 percent, respectively, of the Company’s Passenger revenues originated from Southwest.com (including revenues from SWABIZ®, the Company's online booking tool designed for business Customers who prefer a self-service and low-cost solution for booking their air travel on Southwest). This "direct to Customer" distribution approach has historically provided a cost advantage for the Company because it eliminates fees associated with the use of third party distribution channels such as third party online travel platforms. The Company augments its direct to Customer distribution approach by offering a broad suite of digital platforms to support Customers' travel needs, including full featured websites and apps. These digital platforms help Customers book and manage their Southwest air travel and also facilitate the purchase of the Company’s ancillary products, including EarlyBird, vacation packages, rental car reservations, hotel reservations, and travel activities. In addition, the digital platforms provide self-service tools for reservation management and Customer support.

During 2021, the Company continued to invest in technology designed to enhance revenues and lower costs, while also enhancing digital options for its Customers. To enhance revenues, the Company improved the digital air booking experience through further improvements to the shopping page, the addition of fare upgrade offers, and increased prominence of expanded payment options. To help lower costs, in 2021 the Company increased its focus on improving the day of travel experience. For example, trip related messaging was added to improve awareness of the Company's baggage and boarding process, and a new customer center was added to provide key content about the Southwest experience. The resulting increased awareness of self-service options increased Customer self-service usage and thereby contributed to reduced costs. Further, improvements were made to the digital ticket change process, leading to a higher percentage of ticket changes occurring in digital experiences.

Early in 2021, the Company added an updated COVID travel center, providing location specific details about what to expect while traveling. This material was prominently focused across all shopping and trip related materials. Due to changing U.S. regulations regarding U.S. entry, the Company also deployed self-service workflows for Customers to complete their travel attestations and contact tracing information to reduce transactions at the airport. Automating these experiences reduced what would have been much longer lines while departing countries outside of the United States. These experiences were supplemented with additional day of travel alerts to increase readiness for travel. 

Southwest Business® Initiatives

In addition to improvements in the Company's direct Southwest.com channel of distribution, in recent years the Company has taken significant action to grow its corporate travel business with the goal of making it easier for corporate travel Customers and travel management companies to do business with Southwest.

11
In 2019, the Company entered into an agreement with Amadeus IT Group, S.A. ("Amadeus"), and expanded its agreement with Travelport, LP and Travelport International Operations Limited (collectively, "Travelport"), to enable corporate travel Customers and travel management companies to book Southwest products on the Amadeus and Travelport global distribution system ("GDS") platforms. The Company began accepting corporate travel bookings through (i) Travelport's Apollo and Worldspan GDS platforms in second quarter 2020, (ii) Travelport's Galileo GDS platform in third quarter 2020, and (iii) the Amadeus GDS platform in fourth quarter 2020. The Company's expansion into the Travelport and Amadeus GDS channels is intended to facilitate corporate travel managers' ability to book, modify, and cancel Southwest reservations. 

In 2020, the Company entered into a new full participation distribution agreement with Sabre Corporation ("Sabre"), to enable Sabre to continue to distribute Southwest content through traditional connectivity to corporations, government agencies, and travel management companies through Sabre's GDS. In July 2021, the Company began offering flights for sale within Sabre's GDS, the leading corporate booking channel in the United States. As a result, the Company now offers the ability for business travelers and travel decision makers to book Southwest fares within all major GDS platforms. 

The Company also utilizes Airlines Reporting Corporation to implement industry-standard processes to handle the settlement of tickets booked through Travelport, Amadeus, and Sabre channels. 

Southwest Business has continued to invest in and enhance its online booking tool SWABIZ®, with new mobile capabilities now available, as well as its direct connect channel, with connections to online booking tools, travel management companies, and corporate customers. SWABIZ is designed for business Customers who prefer a self-service and low-cost solution for booking their air travel on Southwest. The site also facilitates car and hotel booking.

Marketing

During 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company implemented and marketed the "Southwest Promise" to reassure Customers and Employees of the Company's commitment to their well-being, by focusing on cleanliness from check-in to deplaning the aircraft through additional stringent cleaning practices across the fleet and throughout the day, as well as measures to support physical distancing and personal protection and wellness throughout the Customer experience.

During early 2021, the Company continued to market the Southwest Promise. In addition, during 2021, the Company marketed its competitive points of differentiation, specifically focusing on flexibility and ease for Customers. Southwest continues to be the only major U.S. airline that offers to all ticketed Customers up to two checked bags that fly free (subject to weight and size limits). Further, Southwest continues to offer low fares and no unexpected bag fees, change fees (although fare differences may apply), or hidden fees. Southwest also does not impose additional fees for items such as seat selection, soft drinks and snacks where available, curb-side check-in where available, and telephone reservations.

The Company also continues to promote all of the many other reasons to fly Southwest in its marketing, such as its hospitality, low fares, expanded network and new destinations, Customer Service, free inflight entertainment, Southwest Business offerings, and its Rapid Rewards loyalty program.

Technology Initiatives

Although during 2020 the Company narrowed its near-team technology focus and deferred a significant number of technology projects in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, over the past several years the Company has committed significant resources to technology improvements in support of its ongoing operations and initiatives. During 2021, the Company achieved the long-awaited milestone of getting all of its aircraft into a single system for aircraft maintenance and record-keeping. This was the Company's largest technology initiative for 2021, and was 

12
one of the most critical system updates the Company has undertaken in the history of its maintenance program. In addition, during 2021 the Company continued its implementation of corporate GDS capabilities in connection with Southwest Business initiatives by initiating flights for sale within Sabre's GDS.

The Company continues to focus on the prioritization and execution of its technology investments and is in the process of continually executing an evolving multi-year plan for technology, with the goal of developing a stronger, more adaptable, and more efficient and reliable technology foundation to support the Company’s strategic priorities. The Company continues to invest significantly in technology resources including, among others, the Company's systems related to (i) human resources management; (ii) flight planning and scheduling, including with respect to schedule changes and Customer reaccommodations; (iii) crew scheduling; (iv) revenue management; and (v) technology infrastructure. 

Environmental Sustainability

The Company remains steadfast in its desire to pursue, implement, and enhance initiatives to address the Company's impact on the environment. Over the years, the Company has undertaken a number of fuel conservation and emissions-related initiatives, such as the following:

•introduction of the MAX aircraft into the Company's fleet, which is more fuel-efficient and releases fewer CO₂ emissions per available seat mile than the Company's other aircraft;

•installation of winglets, which reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency, on all aircraft in the Company's fleet;

•application of periodic engine washes;

•use of electric ground power and pre-conditioned air for aircraft at the gate, when available;

•replacement of eligible internal combustion ground support equipment with electric equipment at select locations;

•deployment of auto-throttle and vertical navigation to maintain optimum cruising speeds;

•implementation of engine start procedures to support the Company's single engine taxi procedures;

•adjustment of the timing of auxiliary power unit starts on originating flights to reduce auxiliary power unit usage;

•implementation of fuel planning initiatives to safely reduce loading of excess fuel;

•retrofitting of aircraft cabin interiors to reduce weight;

•reduction of aircraft engine idle speed while on the ground, which also increases engine life;

•utilization of Company-optimized routes (flying the best wind routes to take advantage of tailwinds or to minimize headwinds);

•improvements in flight planning algorithms to better match the Company's aircraft flight management system and thereby enabling the Company to fly at the most efficient altitudes;

•substitution of Pilot and Flight Attendant flight bags with lighter Electronic Flight Bag tablets; and

•implementation of Real Time Descent Winds (automatic uplinking of up-to-date wind data to the aircraft, allowing crews to time the descent to minimize thrust inputs).

The Company has also participated in Required Navigation Performance ("RNP") operations as part of the FAA's Performance Based Navigation program, a key component of the Next Generation Transportation System (“NextGen”), which is intended to modernize the U.S. air traffic system by addressing limitations on air transportation capacity and making more efficient use of airspace. RNP combines the capabilities of advanced aircraft avionics, satellite navigation (instead of less precise ground-based navigation), and new flight procedures to enhance navigational and operational capabilities, improve fuel efficiency, and minimize greenhouse gas emissions. RNP approaches, which are published by the FAA, are currently available at 66 of the airports Southwest serves. 

13
Southwest continues to work with the FAA to develop and seek more use of RNP approaches and to evolve air traffic control rules to support greater utilization of RNP.

In 2021, the Company announced goals to (i) achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, (ii) maintain carbon neutral growth (to 2019 levels) through the end of the decade, and (iii) reduce carbon emissions intensity per available seat mile (including scope 1 and scope 2 emissions) by at least 20 percent by 2030. The Company also announced a series of actions and initiatives designed to assist the Company in achieving these goals, including agreements with various third parties intended to facilitate the development, production, and usage of commercialized sustainable aviation fuel; the launch of a carbon-offset program that allows Customers to contribute funds for the purchase of carbon offsets for Southwest; and arrangements with nonprofit organizations seeking to address climate change and reduce carbon emissions in aviation. 

As part of its commitment to corporate sustainability, the Company has published the Southwest One Report describing the Company's environmental sustainability goals, actions, initiatives, and strategies, which include the foregoing and other efforts to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and address other environmental matters such as energy and water conservation, waste minimization, and recycling. Information contained in the Southwest One Report is not incorporated by reference into, and does not constitute a part of, this Form 10-K. While the Company believes that the disclosures contained in the Southwest One Report and other voluntary disclosures regarding environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters are responsive to various areas of investor interest, the Company believes that these disclosures do not currently address matters that are material to the Company’s operations, strategy, financial condition, or financial results, although this view may change in the future based on new information that could materially alter the estimates, assumptions, or timelines used to create these disclosures. Given the estimates, assumptions and timelines used to create the Southwest One Report and other voluntary disclosures, the materiality of these disclosures is inherently difficult to assess in advance.

Regulation

The airline industry is heavily regulated, especially by the federal government, and there are a significant number of governmental agencies and legislative bodies that have the ability to directly or indirectly affect the Company and/or the airline industry financially and/or operationally. Examples of regulations affecting the Company and/or the airline industry, imposed by several of these governmental agencies and legislative bodies, are discussed below.

Economic and Operational Regulation

Consumer Protection Regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation

The DOT regulates economic operating authority for air carriers and consumer protection for airline passengers. The DOT may take legal enforcement action against air carriers for violating their regulations by imposing civil penalties up to $35,188 per occurrence.

To provide passenger transportation in the United States, a domestic airline is required to hold both a Certificate of Public Convenience & Necessity from the DOT and an Air Carrier Operating Certificate from the FAA. A Certificate of Public Convenience & Necessity is unlimited in duration, and the Company’s certificate generally permits it to operate among any points within the United States and its territories and possessions. Additional DOT authority, in the form of a certificate or exemption from certificate requirements, is required for a U.S. airline to serve foreign destinations either with its own aircraft or via code-sharing with another airline. Exemptions granted by the DOT to serve international markets are generally limited in duration and are subject to periodic renewal requirements. The DOT may revoke a certificate or exemption, in whole or in part, for failure to comply with federal aviation statutes, regulations, orders, or the terms of the certificate or exemption itself.

The DOT's consumer protection and enforcement authority is derived primarily from a federal statutory prohibition on "unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition" by air carriers. A new DOT rule took effect in January 2021, codifying the definitions for the terms ‘‘unfair’’ and ‘‘deceptive’’ in the DOT’s regulations by 

14
adopting the definitions used by the Federal Trade Commission, and amending and clarifying the procedures the DOT will follow when engaging in aviation consumer protection rulemaking and enforcement. The purpose of this new rule is to help establish clear and consistent criteria for unfair or deceptive practices while aligning DOT’s oversight of aviation entities with other government agencies’ oversight of other sectors of the economy with regard to unfair or deceptive practices.

Under the above-described authority, the DOT has also adopted so-called "Passenger Protection Rules," which address a wide variety of matters, including flight delays on the tarmac, chronically delayed flights, denied boarding compensation, baggage liability requirements, ticket refunds, and advertising of airfares, among others. For example, under the DOT's tarmac delay rule and subject to limited exceptions, air carriers must not allow an aircraft to remain on the tarmac for more than 3 hours (for domestic delays) or more than 4 hours (for international delays), without allowing passengers to deplane.

In addition, the Passenger Protection Rules require airlines to (i) display ontime performance on their websites; (ii) adopt customer service plans, publish those plans on their website, and audit their own compliance with their plans; (iii) designate an employee to monitor the performance of their flights; (iv) provide information to passengers on how to file complaints; (v) respond in a timely and substantive fashion to consumer complaints; (vi) pay compensation to each passenger denied boarding involuntarily from an oversold flight; (vii) refund any checked bag fee for permanently lost luggage; (viii) prominently disclose all potential fees for optional ancillary services on their websites; and (ix) refund passenger fees paid for ancillary services if a flight cancels or oversells and a passenger is unable to take advantage of such services. 

The Passenger Protection Rules also require that (i) advertised fares include all government-mandated taxes and fees; (ii) passengers be allowed to either hold a reservation for up to 24 hours without making a payment or cancel a paid reservation without penalty for 24 hours after the reservation is made, as long as the reservation is made at least seven days in advance of travel; (iii) fares may not increase after purchase; (iv) baggage fees must be disclosed to the passenger at the time of booking; (v) the same baggage allowances and fees must apply throughout a passenger’s trip; (vi) baggage fees must be disclosed on e-ticket confirmations; and (vii) passengers must be promptly notified in the event of delays of more than 30 minutes or if there is a cancellation or diversion of their flight.

The DOT took actions throughout 2021 to bolster its Passenger Protection Rules in certain respects. For example, in January, the DOT issued a final rule increasing involuntary denied boarding and mishandled baggage compensation, and prohibiting airlines from denying boarding to passengers that have already boarded. In September, reacting to complaints filed in the earlier months of the COVID-19 pandemic related to carriers’ refund practices, the DOT announced it plans to solicit comments on a proposed rule that would enhance passengers’ rights when a flight is operating but the passenger decides not to fly because of government restrictions (possibly requiring refunds of non-refundable tickets in those situations). The Company does not believe that pending regulatory developments with respect to the DOT’s Passenger Protection Rules will have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

In addition to its statutory authority to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices or unfair methods of competition, the DOT is charged with prohibiting discrimination by airlines against consumers on the basis of (i) disability; and (ii) race, religion, national origin, sex, or ancestry.

Under this authority, the DOT has proposed a rule that would provide for changes to the accessibility of lavatories on single-aisle aircraft for passengers with disabilities. These proposed changes include modifications to the interior of the lavatory, additional services that airlines would provide with respect to lavatory access, training requirements, and improvements to the aircraft's onboard wheelchair. The DOT has indicated it intends to also propose and seek comments on a separate rule in 2022 that would eventually require airlines to offer a larger lavatory on single-aisle aircraft. Requirements to expand the size of lavatories could impose substantial costs on the Company and have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position. Whether the DOT will 

15
ultimately adopt a new rule requiring larger lavatories, and the timing and application of any new rule, are unknown at this time.

Aviation Taxes and Fees

The statutory authority for the federal government to collect most types of aviation taxes, which are used, in part, to finance programs administered by the FAA, must be periodically reauthorized by the U.S. Congress. The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (the "2018 Reauthorization Act") extends most commercial aviation taxes through September 30, 2023. 

In addition to FAA-related taxes, there are additional federal taxes related to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These taxes do not need to be reauthorized periodically. Congress has set the Transportation Security Fee paid by passengers at $5.60 per one-way passenger trip originating in the U.S. In addition, international passengers arriving in the U.S. are subject to U.S. immigration and customs fees that are indexed to inflation. These fees are used to support the operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP"). Finally, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service imposes an agriculture inspection fee on international passengers arriving in the United States.

Airline passengers are also required to pay a Passenger Facility Charge, a user fee that is authorized via federal statute but assessed by each airport. The maximum Passenger Facility Charge is $4.50 per passenger enplanement. New aviation taxes or regulations may be imposed through the annual congressional budget process. The annual appropriations bill funds the federal government - including the DOT, the FAA, the Transportation Security Administration (the "TSA"), and CBP. Passage of the fiscal year 2021 and 2022 appropriations bill will be considered throughout 2022 and could result in an increase in one or more of the taxes and fees discussed above, as well as new mandates on the DOT to begin or complete rulemakings related to airline consumer protection.

Operational and Safety Regulation

The FAA, an agency within the DOT, has the authority to regulate safety aspects of civil aviation operations. Specifically, the Company and certain of its third-party service providers are subject to the jurisdiction of the FAA with respect to aircraft maintenance and operations, including equipment, ground facilities, dispatch, communications, training, and other matters affecting air safety. The FAA, from time to time, issues orders or directives relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures or operational restrictions. The FAA, acting through its own powers or through the appropriate U.S. Attorney, has the power to bring proceedings for the imposition and collection of civil penalties for violation of the FAA's regulations.

The FAA requires airlines to obtain and maintain an Air Carrier Operating Certificate, as well as other certificates, approvals, and authorities. These certificates, approvals, and authorities are subject to amendment, suspension, or revocation for cause.

As the airlines’ safety regulator, the FAA uses tools, such as temporary flight restrictions, to control aircraft operations within designated areas. The FAA may also issue advisory circulars to provide guidance for compliance with aircraft and pilot certification standards, operational standards, training standards, and other FAA rules. These regulatory tools may create additional costs and/or operational restrictions for the Company. For example, the FAA has expressed concern about the deployment of certain wireless telecommunications systems that may cause interference with certain aircraft avionics, such as radio altimeters. In response, the FAA could impose temporary flight restrictions until the agency believes any safety concerns are resolved. The FAA could also require mitigations from aircraft operators (e.g., aircraft retrofits) as a means to avoid any potential interference.

With respect to airline operations, the FAA has rules in effect with respect to crew flight, duty, and rest times. Among other things, the rules (i) require a ten hour minimum rest period prior to a pilot’s flight duty period; (ii) mandate that a pilot must have an opportunity for eight hours of uninterrupted sleep within the rest period; and (iii) impose pilot "flight time" and "duty time" limitations based upon report times, the number of scheduled flight 

16
segments, and other operational factors. The FAA has established flight attendant duty period limitations and rest requirements based on the length of a flight attendant’s scheduled duty period, number of flight attendants assigned to a flight, and other operational factors. 

The 2018 Reauthorization Act contains a provision requiring a modification to the FAA's rules to increase the required flight attendant rest period between duty periods. FAA rules currently provide that a flight attendant scheduled to a duty period of fourteen hours or less must be given a scheduled rest period of at least nine consecutive hours. This rest period can be reduced to eight consecutive hours under certain circumstances. On November 2, 2021, the FAA issued a proposed rule increasing the minimum rest period to ten consecutive hours and prohibiting a reduction of the minimum rest period under any circumstances. The comment period on the proposed rule closed on January 3, 2022. The implementation of the rule as proposed could require the Company to modify its technology systems and flight attendant staffing practices, which could have a material effect on the Company’s operational performance, costs, earnings, competitive position, and Customer Experience. The FAA has indicated it expects to finalize the rule in 2022.

Pursuant to the 2018 Reauthorization Act, the FAA is required to issue an order requiring installation of a physical secondary cockpit barrier on "each new aircraft that is manufactured" for delivery to a passenger air carrier. A working group comprised of industry technical experts provided advice and recommendations to the FAA in 2020 on the most effective ways to implement the physical secondary cockpit barrier requirement. Depending on if and how the FAA reacts to the working group’s advice and recommendations, as well as the FAA's interpretation and application of the statutory requirement, compliance with the future FAA order could impose a substantial cost on the Company. The FAA has indicated it plans to issue a proposed rule in 2022.

The 2018 Reauthorization Act also contains provisions directing the FAA to examine whether to issue new regulations establishing minimum dimensions for seat size based on safety considerations. Further, the 2018 Reauthorization Act expands human trafficking training requirements beyond flight attendants to include several public-facing Employee work groups, as well as requires air carriers to implement a plan and develop training with protocols for preventing and responding to verbal or physical assault committed against customer service agents. Human trafficking training is required for the Company’s frontline Employees and recommended as voluntary curriculum for other Employees. The Company has also implemented an Employee Assault Prevention and Response Plan that includes training to de-escalate hostile situations, written protocols for dealing with hostile situations, and reporting of relevant incidents to appropriate authorities.

In addition to its role as safety regulator, the FAA operates the nation’s air traffic control system and has continued its lengthy and ongoing effort to implement a multi-faceted, airspace modernization program, NextGen. According to the U.S. government, NextGen will help contribute to a safer, more efficient, and more predictable system, which may potentially contribute to reduced fuel burn, emissions, and noise. As part of the NextGen initiative, in 2010 the FAA published rules requiring most commercial aircraft operating in the national airspace system to be equipped with Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast ("ADS-B") technology by January 1, 2020. ADS-B technology is intended to enhance safety and efficiency by moving from ground-based radar and navigational aids to precise tracking using satellite signals. In addition to environmental and efficiency benefits, ADS-B technology gives pilots and air traffic controllers new tools to reduce the risk of runway incursions and aircraft collisions. The Company has implemented technology and programs intended to comply with all applicable ADS-B requirements. On November 9, 2021, the U.S. government announced an Aviation Climate Action Plan to reduce emissions by, among other initiatives and efforts, operationalizing NextGen to realize the full potential of modernized infrastructure and systems, and enhancing data quality and information distribution to enable operators to fly more fuel-efficient trajectories.

The Air Traffic Organization ("ATO") is the operational arm of the FAA. The ATO is responsible for providing safe and efficient air navigation services to all of the United States and large portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The Company is subject to any operational changes imposed by the FAA/ATO as they relate to the NextGen program, as well as the day-to-day management of the air traffic control system.

17
 Passenger and Occupational Health Regulation 

The Company is subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to health and occupational safety, including Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”), Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Food and Drug Administration regulations. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, federal, state, and local government authorities implemented directives, orders, and regulations intended to mitigate the spread of the virus, and in response, the Company modified its practices, policies, and procedures, as appropriate. For example, the CDC and TSA issued orders, effective February 1, 2021, mandating the wearing of face masks on all commercial flights and within airports, subject to certain limited exceptions. The mask mandate has been extended through March 18, 2022, and could be extended again. In addition, on October 25, 2021, the CDC and CBP issued orders, effective November 8, 2021, requiring that adult non-citizen, non-immigrant passengers traveling to the United States by air be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and show proof of their vaccination status. The orders also require that all passengers traveling to the United States by air provide basic contact tracing information to airlines before boarding. 

In September 2021, the President of the United States issued an Executive Order establishing a vaccination requirement for employees of covered federal contractors. The federal government required that federal contractors have their workforce vaccinated (or request an accommodation) by December 8, 2021. The deadline was later extended to January 4, 2022. The Company started an active campaign to notify Employees of the need to submit proof of COVID-19 vaccination, or apply for an accommodation, by January 4, 2022. On December 3, 2021, the company announced that 93 percent of its Employees were vaccinated, or had requested an accommodation. Due to legal challenges to the vaccine mandate, the Company announced on December 20, 2021, that it is no longer targeting a January 4, 2022, deadline for compliance. However, if the vaccine mandate is revived, the Company will resume efforts to work with Employees who have not yet either submitted proof of vaccination or requested an accommodation.

Additional health requirements or standards, whether mandated by government agencies or voluntarily adopted by the Company, related to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise intended to mitigate the spread of communicable diseases could affect the Company’s costs and performance.

For further information pertaining to the FAA’s oversight and regulatory authority, as well as health and safety regulations related to COVID-19, see “Risk Factors - Legal, Regulatory, Compliance, and Reputational Risks, and COVID-19 Risks.” 

Security Regulation

Pursuant to the Aviation and Transportation Security Act ("ATSA"), the TSA, a federal agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, is responsible for certain civil aviation security matters. ATSA and subsequent TSA regulations and procedures implementing ATSA address, among other things, (i) flight deck security; (ii) the use of federal air marshals onboard flights; (iii) airport and aircraft access security; (iv) airline crew security training; (v) security screening of passengers, baggage, cargo, mail, employees, and vendors; (vi) training and qualifications of security screening personnel; (vii) provision of passenger data to CBP; and (viii) background checks.

Under ATSA, substantially all security officers at airports are federal employees, and significant other elements of airline and airport security are overseen and performed by federal employees, including federal security managers, federal law enforcement officers, and federal air marshals. TSA personnel and TSA-mandated security procedures can affect the Company's operations, costs, and Customer experience. For example, as part of its security measures, the TSA regulates the types of liquid items that can be carried onboard aircraft. In addition, as part of its Secure Flight program, the TSA requires airlines to collect a passenger's full name (as it appears on a government-issued ID), date of birth, gender, and Redress Number (if applicable). Airlines must transmit this information to Secure Flight, which uses the information to perform matching against terrorist watch lists. After matching passenger information against the watch lists, Secure Flight transmits the matching results back to airlines. This serves to 

18
identify individuals for more extensive security screening and to prevent individuals on watch lists from boarding an aircraft. It also helps prevent the misidentification of passengers who have names similar to individuals on watch lists. The TSA's multi-layered approach to airport security also includes physical pat down procedures at security checkpoints. These procedures have raised privacy concerns by some air travelers, and have caused delays at screening checkpoints.

The Company, in conjunction with the TSA, participates in TSA PreCheck™, a pre-screening initiative that allows passengers deemed low risk by the TSA to move through security checkpoints with greater efficiency and ease when traveling. Eligible passengers may use dedicated screening lanes at certain airports the Company serves for screening benefits, which include leaving on shoes, light outerwear, and belts, as well as leaving laptops and permitted liquids in carryon bags. A similar CBP-administered program, Global Entry®, allows expedited clearance for pre-approved, low-risk international travelers upon arrival in the United States. The TSA has expressed its plans to leverage advanced transportation security screening technologies, including biometric solutions, to improve security effectiveness and operational efficiency, while also enhancing the passenger experience. The advanced technologies have prompted privacy, cost, and legal concerns from air carriers, travelers, and advocacy groups, which could affect the timing and viability of the TSA's plans.

The Company also participates in the TSA Known Crewmember® program, which is a risk-based screening system that enables TSA security officers to positively verify the identity and employment status of flight-crew members. The program expedites flight crew member access to sterile areas of airports.

The Company works collaboratively with TSA, foreign national governments, and airports to provide risk-based security measures at international locations served by the Company.

The Department of Homeland Security has granted the Company designation coverage under the Support Anti-Terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002 (the "SAFETY Act") through September 29, 2022. Designation coverage affords the Company certain limitations of liability for claims arising out of an "act of terrorism," as defined under the SAFETY Act. The designation is based on the security program used by the Company to protect its Employees, Customers, and assets from terrorists and other criminal activities.

The Company has made significant investments in facilities, equipment, and technology to process Customers, checked baggage, and cargo efficiently in compliance with applicable security regulations; however, the Company is not able to predict the impact, if any, that various security measures or TSA resource limitations at certain airports will have on Passenger revenues and the Company’s costs, either in the short-term or the long-term.

Environmental Regulation

The Company is subject to various federal laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, including the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as well as state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern aircraft drinking water, emissions, storm water discharges from operations, and the disposal of materials such as jet fuel, chemicals, hazardous waste, and aircraft deicing fluid.

Additionally, in conjunction with airport authorities, other airlines, and state and local environmental regulatory agencies, the Company, as a normal course of business, undertakes voluntary investigation or remediation of soil or groundwater contamination at various airport sites. The Company has not historically experienced any airport site environmental liability that has had a material adverse effect on its capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. However, many airports, as well as federal, state and local governmental authorities, are increasingly focused on groundwater contamination caused by so-called “forever chemicals,” most notably per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”). PFAS have been used in many manufacturing and industrial applications over many decades and can be found in numerous products, including building materials and household products. Most notably for aviation, PFAS are a key component in aqueous film-forming foam (“AFFF”), which is widely used to 

19
fight petroleum-based fires at both commercial and military aviation facilities. The FAA and the U.S. Department of Defense have strict performance specifications for fire suppression systems, which has contributed to the use of AFFF/PFAS over the decades. PFAS is now the focus of regulatory oversight at airports, as well as the source of litigation by airports against AFFF manufacturers. Moreover, regulatory authorities at the federal, state, and local levels are contemplating both the prohibition of PFAS-based AFFF and costly remediation efforts at airports to address groundwater contamination. The evolving legal and regulatory activity surrounding PFAS could lead to an inadequate supply of FAA-certified AFFF throughout the aviation system and/or increased operating costs at certain airports.

The federal government, as well as several state and local governments, the governments of other countries, and the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization ("ICAO") have implemented legislative and regulatory proposals and voluntary measures to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. At the federal level, in July 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") issued a final endangerment finding for greenhouse gas emissions from certain types of aircraft engines, which the agency determined contribute to pollution that causes climate change and endangers public health and the environment. Following this endangerment finding, per the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA adopted aircraft greenhouse gas emissions standards in December 2020. These standards apply to airframe and aircraft engine manufacturers, and align with the standards previously adopted by ICAO. On November 15, 2021, the EPA affirmed the agency will not reconsider the rule adopting the standards; however, several states and non-government organizations have filed legal petitions challenging the EPA’s adoption of the rule.

In addition to aircraft emissions standards, ICAO implemented a "global market-based measure" framework in an effort to control carbon dioxide emissions from international aviation. The focal point of this framework is a carbon offsetting system applicable to aircraft operators designed to cap the growth of emissions related to international aviation emissions. ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation ("CORSIA") program is a global market-based measure intended to cap carbon emissions from international civil aviation at their 2019 levels, enabling carbon-neutral growth for the international aviation sector by requiring that international aviation emissions above 2019 levels are offset or reduced through the use of eligible sustainable aviation fuels. The U.S. federal government has opted to participate in the voluntary phases of the CORSIA program from 2021-2026 (additional phases extend through 2035). As part of the CORSIA program, the Company is currently monitoring its international emissions for reporting purposes. Data collected from applicable international flight activity in 2019 forms the baseline and is used in the calculations to determine subsequent carbon offsetting requirements under the CORSIA program. Regardless of the method of regulation or application of CORSIA, further policy changes with regard to climate change are possible, which could significantly increase operating costs in the airline industry and, as a result, adversely affect operations.

In addition to climate change, aircraft noise continues to be an environmental focus, especially as the FAA implements new flight procedures as part of its NextGen airspace modernization program discussed above. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 gives airport operators the right, under certain circumstances, to implement local noise abatement programs, provided they do not unreasonably interfere with interstate or foreign commerce or the national air transportation system. Some airports have established airport restrictions to limit noise, including restrictions on aircraft types to be used and limits on the number of hourly or daily operations or the time of operations. These types of restrictions can cause curtailments in service or increases in operating costs and can limit the ability of air carriers to expand operations at the affected airports.

At the federal level, the FAA has committed to inform and involve the public, engage with communities, and give meaningful consideration to community concerns and views when developing new flight procedures, and there is a possibility that Congress may enact legislation in the future to address local noise concerns at one or more commercial airports in the United States. In addition, the 2018 Reauthorization Act requires the FAA to consider community noise concerns when proposing a new navigation departure procedure or amending an existing navigation procedure that would direct aircraft over noise sensitive areas. This requirement could delay or otherwise impede the implementation or use of more efficient flight paths.

20
Government efforts at the international, federal, state, or local levels to address worldwide climate change, manage greenhouse gas emissions, and reduce aircraft noise could affect aircraft operators, original equipment manufacturers, producers and sellers of aviation fuel, and other third parties on which the Company is dependent. Additional legislative or regulatory activity in this area could require modifications to the Company’s equipment, operations, and strategy, and have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Data Privacy and Security Regulation

Like all industries, the airline industry has experienced heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data privacy and data security in the United States and elsewhere. As a result, the Company has been monitoring a growing and fast-evolving set of legal requirements, including with respect to consumer access and control over their personal information.

The Company expects federal, state, and other governments to assess and implement cyber-security and data privacy protections, which could result in expanded compliance burdens, costs, and enforcement risks for the Company.

International Regulation

All international air service is subject to certain U.S. federal requirements and approvals, as well as the regulatory requirements of the appropriate authorities of the foreign countries involved. Foreign regulatory agencies located in jurisdictions served by the Company can impose requirements on various aspects of the Company’s business, including safety, marketing, ticket sales, staffing, and tax. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, certain U.S and foreign regulatory authorities have imposed health requirements for international passengers. For example, on October 25, 2021, the CDC issued orders, effective November 8, 2021, requiring that adult non-citizen, non-immigrant passengers traveling to the United States by air be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and show proof of their vaccination status. The orders also require that all passengers traveling to the United States by air provide basic contact tracing information to airlines before boarding. These orders and other new or existing health requirements for international travel could adversely affect demand and the performance of the Company’s international flight offerings.

The Company has obtained the necessary economic authority from the DOT, as well as approvals required by the FAA and applicable foreign government entities, to conduct operations, under certain circumstances, to points outside of the continental United States currently served by the Company. Certain international authorities and approvals held by the Company are subject to periodic renewal requirements. The Company requests extensions of such authorities and approvals when and as appropriate. To the extent the Company seeks to serve additional foreign destinations in the future, or to renew its authority to serve certain routes, it may be required to obtain necessary authority from the DOT and/or approvals from the FAA, as well as any applicable foreign government entity.

Certain international markets are governed by bilateral air transportation agreements between the United States and foreign countries. Changes in U.S. or foreign government aviation policies could result in the alteration or termination of such agreements, diminish the value of the Company's existing international authorities, present barriers to renewing existing or securing new authorities, or otherwise affect the Company's international operations. There are also capacity limitations at certain international airports, which could impact future service levels. In general, bilateral agreements between the United States and foreign countries the Company currently serves, or may serve in the future, may be subject to renegotiation or reinterpretation from time to time. While the U.S. government has negotiated "open skies" agreements with many countries, which allow for unrestricted access between the United States and respective foreign destinations, agreements with other countries may restrict the Company's entry into those destinations and/or its related growth opportunities.

The CBP is the federal agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security charged with facilitating international trade, collecting import duties, and enforcing U.S. regulations with respect to trade, customs, and immigration. To the extent the Company expands its international flight offerings, CBP and its requirements and resources will also become increasingly important considerations to the Company. For instance, with the exception of flights from a small number of foreign "preclearance" locations, arriving international flights may only land at CBP-designated airports, and CBP officers must be present and in sufficient numbers at those airports to effectively process and inspect arriving international passengers, baggage, and cargo. Thus, CBP personnel and CBP-mandated procedures can affect the Company's operations, costs, and Customer experience. The Company has made significant investments in facilities, equipment, and technologies at certain airports in order to improve the Customer experience and to assist CBP with its inspection and processing duties; however, the Company is not able to predict the impact, if any, that various CBP measures or the lack of CBP resources will have on the Company's revenues and costs, either in the short-term or the long-term.

Insurance

The Company carries insurance of types customary in the airline industry and in amounts the Company deems adequate to protect the Company and its property and to comply both with applicable regulations and certain of the Company's credit and lease agreements. The policies principally provide coverage for public and passenger liability, property damage, cargo and baggage liability, loss or damage to aircraft, engines, and spare parts, and workers’ compensation. In addition, the Company carries a cyber-security insurance policy with regards to data protection and business interruption associated with both security breaches from malicious parties and from certain system failures. The Company also manages insured risk through the use of reinsurance programs, pooling mechanisms, and a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary.

Although the Company has been able to purchase aviation, property, liability, and professional insurance via the commercial insurance marketplace, available commercial insurance could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect the Company's risk of loss from future events, including acts of terrorism. Further, available cyber-security insurance with regards to data protection and business interruption could be more expensive in the future and/or have material differences in coverage than insurance that has historically been provided and may not be adequate to protect the Company's risk of loss. With respect to any insurance claims, policy coverages and claims are subject to acceptance by the many insurers involved and may require arbitration and/or mediation to effectively settle the claims over prolonged periods of time.

Competition

Competition within the airline industry is intense and highly unpredictable, and Southwest has historically competed with other airlines on virtually all of its scheduled routes. In recent years, the majority of domestic airline service has been provided by Southwest and the other largest major U.S. airlines, including American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines. The DOT defines major U.S. airlines as those airlines with annual revenues of at least $1 billion; there are currently 13 passenger airlines offering scheduled service, including Southwest, that meet this standard.

Key competitive factors within the airline industry have historically included (i) pricing and cost structure; (ii) routes, loyalty programs, and schedules; (iii) customer service, operational reliability, product offerings, and amenities; and (iv) balance sheet health. As discussed below, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered the competitive landscape amongst the airlines, as the industry has been forced to prioritize liquidity and cost control, which in turn has driven actions such as taking on significantly more debt and instituting more widespread discounted fares and flexible customer policies to stimulate traffic.

Airlines, including Southwest, also compete for customers with alternatives to travel, such as videoconferencing and business communication platforms. These alternatives have become particularly prevalent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

22
Pricing and Cost Structure

Pricing is a significant competitive factor in the airline industry, and the availability of fare information on the Internet allows travelers to easily compare fares and identify competitor promotions and discounts. During 2020 and 2021, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company experienced an increasingly competitive fare environment, as airlines offered significantly discounted fares to attempt to address unprecedented decreases in consumer demand. 

Pricing can be driven by a variety of factors. In addition to the need to stimulate traffic, as has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, under normal circumstances, airlines may discount fares to drive traffic in new markets and/or grow market share in existing markets.

The Company believes its low-cost operating structure has historically provided it with an advantage over many of its airline competitors by enabling it to continue to charge low fares. In addition, the Company believes its low-cost operating structure provided it with a significant financial competitive advantage relative to many of its competitors in responding to the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While it has become increasingly difficult for the Company to improve upon its industry cost position, the Company believes its Customer Service and flexible Customer and Rapid Rewards policies continue to positively differentiate it from many of its competitors.

Routes, Loyalty Programs, and Schedules

The Company also competes with other airlines based on markets served, loyalty opportunities, and flight schedules. While the Company has a robust, point-to-point route network in the United States, some major airlines have more extensive global route structures than Southwest, including more extensive international networks. In addition, many competitors have entered into significant commercial relationships with other airlines, such as strategic alliances, code-sharing, and capacity purchase agreements, which increase the airlines' opportunities to expand their route offerings. An alliance or code-sharing agreement enables an airline to offer flights that are operated by another airline and also allows the airline’s customers to book travel that includes segments on different airlines through a single reservation or ticket. As a result, depending on the nature of the specific alliance or code-sharing arrangement, a participating airline may be able to, among other things, (i) offer its customers access to more destinations than it would be able to serve on its own, (ii) gain exposure in markets it does not otherwise serve, and (iii) increase the perceived frequency of its flights on certain routes. More extensive route structures, as well as alliance and code-sharing arrangements, not only provide additional route flexibility for participating airlines, they can also allow these airlines to offer their customers more opportunities to earn and redeem loyalty miles or points. A capacity purchase agreement enables an airline to expand its route structure by paying another airline (e.g., a regional airline with smaller aircraft) to operate flights on its behalf in markets that it does not, or cannot, serve itself. The Company continues to evaluate and implement initiatives to better enable itself to offer additional itineraries, and has opened 18 new airports since the COVID-19 pandemic began, which has significantly increased its domestic route network.

Customer Service, Operational Reliability, Product Offerings, and Amenities

Southwest also competes with other airlines with respect to Customer Service, operational reliability (such as ontime performance), product offerings, and passenger amenities. According to statistics published by the DOT, Southwest has historically ranked at or near the top among domestic carriers in Customer Satisfaction for having the lowest Customer complaint ratio. However, in particular in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, carriers are increasingly focusing on customer-friendly policies as opportunities to win and retain Customers. In addition, some airlines have more seating options and associated passenger amenities than Southwest, including first class, business class, and other premium seating and related amenities, which can appeal in particular to business customers. However, the Company believes its introduction of its fares in the Global Distribution Systems (GDS) provides an opportunity to increase the Company's market share of business customers. New and different types of aircraft 

23
flown by competitors could have operational attributes and passenger amenities that could be considered more attractive to certain consumers than those associated with the Company's existing fleet. 

Balance Sheet Health

The Company believes it is emerging from the COVID-19 pandemic with a strengthened financial position relative to its competitors in the U.S. airline industry, which has put the Company in a better position to support future growth. Further, the Company has maintained its investment-grade rating by all three major credit agencies (Moody’s, S&P Global, and Fitch) throughout the pandemic, and is currently the only major U.S. passenger airline with an investment-grade rating. The Company believes its balance sheet provided it advantaged access to liquidity during the pandemic.

Other Forms of Competition

Technology advancements have provided alternatives to air travel, such as videoconferencing, business communication platforms, and the Internet, and these alternatives have significantly increased in scope during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company is subject to the risk that the significantly increased use of these alternatives could result in permanent changes to consumer behavior and thereby negatively affect demand for air travel.

The airline industry is also subject to varying degrees of competition from other forms of transportation, including surface transportation by automobiles, buses, and trains. Inconveniences and delays associated with air travel security measures can increase surface competition. In addition, surface competition can be significant during economic downturns when consumers cut back on discretionary spending and fewer choose to fly, or when gasoline prices are lower, making surface transportation a less expensive option. Because of the relatively high percentage of short-haul travel provided by Southwest, it is particularly exposed to competition from surface transportation in these instances. 

Seasonality

The Company's business is ordinarily seasonal. Generally, in most markets the Company serves, demand for air travel is greater during the summer months, and, therefore, revenues in the airline industry tend to be stronger in the second (April 1 - June 30) and third (July 1 - September 30) quarters of the year than in the first (January 1 - March 31) and fourth (October 1 - December 31) quarters of the year. As a result, in many cases, the Company's results of operations reflect this seasonality. Factors that could alter this seasonality include, among others, global pandemics such as COVID-19, the price of fuel, general economic conditions, changes in consumer behavior, governmental action, extreme or severe weather and natural disasters, fears of terrorism or war, or changes in the competitive environment. Therefore, the Company's quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year, and historical operating results in a quarterly or annual period are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.

Employees

Total Employees and Labor Union Activity

At December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 55,100 active fulltime equivalent Employees, consisting of approximately 23,500 flight, 3,200 maintenance, 21,000 ground, Customer, and fleet service, and 7,400 management, technology, finance, marketing, and clerical personnel (associated with non-operational departments). The Company continues to focus on its hiring needs to meet schedule demands. The labor force participation rate remains depressed despite an increase in jobs, especially in the transportation and hospitality industries. There is an ongoing battle for talent, leading to less candidate supply and a decline in qualified candidates. 

Approximately 82 percent of Company Employees at December 31, 2021, were represented by labor unions. The Railway Labor Act establishes the right of airline employees to organize and bargain collectively. Under the 

24
Railway Labor Act, collective-bargaining agreements between an airline and a labor union generally do not expire, but instead become amendable as of an agreed date. By the amendable date, if either party wishes to modify the terms of the agreement, it must notify the other party in the manner required by the Railway Labor Act and/or described in the agreement. After receipt of the notice, the parties must meet for direct negotiations. If no agreement is reached, either party may request the National Mediation Board to appoint a federal mediator. If no agreement is reached in mediation, the National Mediation Board may determine an impasse exists and offer binding arbitration to the parties. If either party rejects binding arbitration, a 30-day "cooling off" period begins. At the end of this 30-day period, the parties may engage in "self-help," unless a Presidential Emergency Board is established to investigate and report on the dispute. The appointment of a Presidential Emergency Board maintains the "status quo" for an additional period of time. If the parties do not reach agreement during this period, the parties may then engage in "self-help." "Self-help" includes, among other things, a strike by the union or the airline’s imposition of any or all of its proposed amendments and the hiring of new employees to replace any striking workers.

The following table sets forth the Company's Employee groups subject to collective bargaining and the status of their respective collective-bargaining agreements as of December 31, 2021:

Human Capital Resources

General

The Company’s approach to human capital is a critical strategy with priorities that include, among others: (i) attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse and talented workforce; (ii) providing opportunities for learning, development, career growth, and movement within the Company; (iii) evaluating compensation and benefits, and rewarding performance; (iv) investing in physical, emotional, and financial health of Employees; (v) obtaining 

25
Employee feedback; (vi) maintaining and enhancing Company culture; and (vii) communicating with the Board of Directors on a routine basis on key topics, including executive succession planning.

The Company has implemented many programs designed to achieve these priorities, including strong Employee training and benefits programs. The Company's vast Employee training and development opportunities address, among other things, leadership development; diversity, equity, and inclusion; communication skills; and human trafficking awareness. The Company rewards Employees with competitive compensation and benefits packages, including attractive medical plans, a 401(k) plan with a dollar-for-dollar match for Employees other than Pilots (subject to vesting requirements and certain compensation limits), a 401(k) plan with a non-elective contribution of 15 percent for Pilots, and a profit sharing plan.

The Company regularly conducts Employee surveys to assess job satisfaction of its Employees, and uses information from the surveys to improve the Company’s ability to attract, develop, and retain talented Employees who will help advance the Company. For many years, the bonus opportunity for the Company's senior leadership group, including its executive officers, has been tied to the Company's performance relative to multiple pre-established performance metrics, which have from time to time included the Company's voluntary turnover rate for Employees. In addition to bonus opportunities for the Company’s senior leadership group, the Company has implemented performance-based compensation programs for other non-contract employee leaders, including managers, supervisors, team leads, and certain other Employees.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

Diversity, equity, and inclusion ("DEI") is also an integral part of the Company’s culture and processes that support recruitment, hiring, training, retention, and advancement. In an effort to advance the Company's commitment to DEI, the Company has established the following goals:

•Evolve hiring and development practices to support diversity goals, including posting all open Leadership positions (Supervisor to Vice President) and requiring diverse candidate slates for each role; 

•Measure progress in increasing diversity in Senior Leadership; 

•Double the percentage of racial diversity and increase gender diversity in the Company’s Senior Management Committee by 2025; and

•Engaging the Company’s breadth of community partners to leverage relationships in sourcing diverse talent.

Additionally, the Company’s Board of Directors has committed to increasing its diverse representation by 2025. The Company has a dedicated DEI Department that provides regular updates to the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors. To continue the Company's commitment to inclusion, the DEI Department has launched a multi-year training plan to increase the cultural competency of the Company's workforce.

During 2021, the Company took tangible steps to update the required infrastructure, processes, and practices to meet these objectives. The DEI Department formed an Executive Steering Committee to support the strategic direction of this progress. In addition, the Company evolved its talent acquisition processes by requiring diverse candidate pools, inclusion training for all hiring Leaders, and the creation of a Diversity Recruiting Center of Excellence. The Company also works with community partners in support of its efforts to continue developing diverse and inclusive talent pipelines and expanding recruiting efforts. The Company also recently launched a formal Sponsorship and Mentorship Program. In addition to current initiatives, the DEI Department has established a five-year enterprise strategic plan to continue advancing DEI efforts throughout the organization. The Company's motivation is to be a healthy organization where Employees thrive, feel appreciated, valued, and have an authentic sense of belonging.
