PART I

ITEM 1. Business

General

Henry Schein, Inc. is a solutions company for health care professionals powered by a network of people and technology. We believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental and medical practitioners, as well as alternate sites of care. Our philosophy is grounded in our commitment to help customers operate a more efficient and successful business so the practitioner can provide better clinical care.

With more than 89 years of experience distributing health care products, we have built a vast set of small, mid-sized and large customers in the dental and medical markets, serving more than one million customers worldwide across dental practices, laboratories, physician practices, and ambulatory surgery centers, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics. 

We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 21,600 people (of which approximately 10,700 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 32 countries and territories. Our broad global footprint has evolved over time through our organic success as well as through contribution from strategic acquisitions.

We offer a comprehensive selection of more than 120,000 branded products and Henry Schein private brand products in stock, as well as more than 180,000 additional products available as special-order items. Our infrastructure, including over 3.8 million square feet of space in 27 strategically located distribution centers around the world, enables us to historically provide rapid and accurate order fulfillment, better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency. This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.

We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services. These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base. Our dental businesses serve office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools, government and other institutions. Our medical businesses serve physician offices, urgent care centers, ambulatory care sites, emergency medical technicians, dialysis centers, home health, federal and state governments and large enterprises, such as group practices and integrated delivery networks, among other providers across a wide range of specialties. 

The health care distribution reportable segment, combining our global dental and medical businesses, distributes consumable products, dental specialty products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins. While our primary go-to-market strategy is in our capacity as a distributor, we also market and sell under our own private label portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable merchandise products, and manufacture certain dental specialty products in the areas of implants, orthodontics and endodontics. 

The technology and value-added services reportable segment provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners. Henry Schein One, the largest contributor of sales to this category, offers dental practice management solutions for dental and medical practitioners. In addition, we offer dentists and physicians a broad suite of electronic health records, integrated revenue cycle management, patient communication services including electronic marketing and web-site design, analytics and patient demand generation. Finally, our value-added practice solutions include practice consultancy, education, and the facilitation of financial service offerings (on a non-recourse basis) to help dentists and physicians operate and expand their business operations. We believe our hands-on consultative approach to provide solutions to support practice decision-making is a key differentiator for our business.

Recent Developments

See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Developments” herein for a discussion related to the COVID-19 pandemic and recent corporate transactions.

Industry

The global health care distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse. The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to mid-sized and large group practices ranging in size from a few practitioners to several hundred practices owned or operated by dental support organizations (DSOs), medical group purchasing organizations (GPOs), hospital systems or integrated delivery networks (IDNs).

Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment. The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner, hygienist or office manager. Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.

The health care distribution industry continues to experience growth due to demand driven by the aging population, increased health care awareness and the importance of preventative care, an increasing understanding of the connection between good oral health and overall health, improved access to care globally, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage and technological improvements, including the advancement of software and services, prosthetic solutions and telemedicine. In addition, the non-acute market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices and ambulatory surgery centers.

We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities. This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base. 

In addition, customer consolidation will likely lead to multiple locations under common management and the movement of more procedures from the hospital setting to the physician or alternate care setting as the health care industry is increasingly focused on efficiency and cost containment. This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices. It also has accelerated the growth of health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support. We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.

Competition 

The distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive. Many of the health care products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers. In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products. Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors. In certain parts of the dental end market, such as those related to dental specialty products, and medical end market manufacturers already sell directly to end customers.

In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental and medical products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, e-commerce capabilities, customer service and

4
value-added products and services. In the dental market, our primary competitors in the U.S. are the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company. In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and local level. Our primary competitors in the U.S. medical market, which accounts for the large majority of our global medical sales, are McKesson Corporation and Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors. We also compete with a number of regional and local medical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians. With regard to our dental software, we compete against numerous companies, including the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc., Carestream Health, Inc., Open Dental Software, Inc., PlanetDDS LLC, Good Methods Global Inc. (d.b.a. CareStack) and Curve Dental, LLC. In other software end markets, including revenue cycle management, patient relationship management and patient demand generation, we compete with companies such as Vyne Therapeutics Inc., EDI-Health Group, Inc. (d.b.a. Dental X Change, Inc.), Weave Communications, Inc., Solutionreach, Inc., ZocDoc, Inc., LocalMed Inc. and Prosites Inc. The medical practice management and electronic medical records market is fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks, Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. and Epic Systems Corporation. 

Outside of the U.S., we believe we are the only global distributor of supplies and equipment to dental practices and our competitors are primarily local and regional companies. We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Proclinic SA, Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy and Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., as well as a large number of other dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers in international countries and territories we serve.

Competitive Strengths

We have more than 89 years of experience in distributing products to health care practitioners resulting in strong awareness of the Henry Schein® brand. Our competitive strengths include:

A focus on meeting our customers’ unique needs. We are committed to providing customized solutions to our customers that are driven by our understanding of the end markets we serve and reflect the technology-driven products and services best suited for their practice needs. We are committed to continuing to enhance these offerings through organic investment in our products and our teams, as well as through the acquisition of new products and services that may help us better serve our customers.

Direct sales and marketing expertise. Our sales and marketing efforts are designed to establish and solidify customer relationships through personal or virtual visits by field sales representatives, frequent direct marketing and telesales contact, emphasizing our broad product lines, including exclusive distribution agreements, competitive prices and ease of order placement, particularly through our e-commerce platforms. The key elements of our direct sales and marketing efforts are:

• Field sales consultants. We have over 3,450 field sales consultants, including equipment sales specialists, covering major North American, European and other international markets. These consultants complement our direct marketing and telesales efforts and enable us to better market, service and support the sale of more sophisticated products and equipment.

• Marketing. During 2021, we marketed to existing and prospective office-based health care providers through a combination of owned, earned and paid digital channels, as well as through catalogs, flyers, direct mail and other promotional materials. Our strategies included an emphasis on educational content through webinars and content marketing initiatives. We continue to enhance our marketing technology to improve our targeting capability and the relevance of messaging and offers.

• Telesales. We support our direct marketing effort with approximately 2,100 inbound and outbound telesales representatives, who facilitate order processing, generate new sales through direct and frequent contact with customers and stay abreast of market developments and the hundreds of new products, services and technologies introduced each year to educate practice personnel.

5
• Electronic commerce solutions. We provide our customers and sales teams with innovative and competitive e-commerce solutions. We continue to invest in our e-commerce platform to offer enhanced content management so customers can more easily find the products they need and to enable an engaging purchase experience, supported by excellent customer service. 

• Social media. Our operating entities and employees engage our customers and supplier partners through various social media platforms, which are an important element of our communications and marketing efforts. We continue to expand our social media presence to raise awareness about issues, engage customers beyond a sale and deliver services and solutions to specialized audiences.

Broad product and service offerings at competitive prices. We offer a broad range of products and services to our customers, at competitive prices, in the following categories:

• Consumable supplies and equipment. We distribute consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, dental specialty products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins. We offer over 120,000 Stock Keeping Units, or SKUs, to our customers. We offer over 180,000 additional SKUs to our customers in the form of special order items. We also market and sell our own private label portfolio of cost-effective, high-quality consumable merchandise products and manufacture certain dental specialty products in the areas of implants, orthodontics and endodontics. 

• Technology and other value-added products and services. We sell practice management, business analytics, patient engagement and patient demand creation software solutions to our dental customers. Our practice management solutions provide practitioners with electronic medical records, patient treatment history, analytics, billing, accounts receivable analyses and management, appointment calendars, electronic claims processing and word processing programs, network and hardware services, e-commerce and electronic marketing services, sourcing third party patient payment plans, transition services and training and education programs for practitioners. We also sell medical software for practice management, certified electronic health records (“EHR”) and e-Prescribe medications and prescription solutions through MicroMD®. We have approximately 950 technical representatives supporting customers using our practice management solutions and services. As of December 25, 2021, we had an active user base of approximately 95,700 practices and 400,000 consumers, including users of AxiUm, Dentally®, Dentrix Ascend®, Dental Vision®, Dentrix® Dental Systems, Dentrix® Enterprise, Easy Dental®, EndoVision®, Evolution® and EXACT®, Gesden®, Jarvis Analytics™, Julie® Software, Oasis, OMSVision®, Orisline®, PBS Endo®, PerioVision®, Power Practice® Px, PowerDent, and Viive® and subscriptions for Demandforce®, Sesame, and Lighthouse360® for dental practices and DentalPlans.com® for dental patients; and MicroMD® for physician practices.

• Repair services. We have over 140 equipment sales and service centers worldwide that provide a variety of repair, installation and technical services for our health care customers. Our over 2,175 technicians provide installation and repair services for: dental handpieces; dental and medical small equipment; table-top sterilizers and large dental equipment.

• Financial services. We offer our customers solutions in operating their practices more efficiently by providing access to a number of financial services and products provided by third party suppliers (including non-recourse financing for equipment, technology and software products, non-recourse practice financing for leasehold improvements, business debt consolidation and commercial real estate, non-recourse patient financing and credit card processing) at rates that we believe are generally lower than what our customers would be able to secure independently. We also provide staffing services, dental practice valuation and brokerage services.

Commitment to superior customer service. We maintain a strong commitment to providing superior customer service. We frequently monitor our customer service through customer surveys, focus groups and statistical reports. Our customer service policy primarily focuses on:

6
• Exceptional order fulfillment. We ship an average of approximately 156,000 cartons daily. Historically, approximately 99% of items have been shipped without back ordering and were shipped on the same business day the order is received. Due to the significant increase in demand for personal protective equipment (“PPE”), as a result of COVID-19, during the year ended December 25, 2021, approximately 96% of items ordered were shipped without back ordering. As the demand for PPE stabilizes, we expect our percentage of items shipped without back-ordering and shipped on the same day to return to historical levels.

• Comprehensive ordering process. Customers may place orders 24 hours a day, 7 days a week via e-commerce solutions, telephone, fax, e-mail and mail.

Integrated management information systems. Our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales, order fulfillment and financial and operational reporting. These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics.

Cost-effective purchasing. We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitively priced provider of health care products. We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost. In 2021, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 30% and 4%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases.

Efficient distribution. We distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment. These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems. Once an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location for order fulfillment.

Business Strategy

Our objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider of health care products and services to office-based dental and medical practitioners by increasing their efficiency and success. To accomplish this, we apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:

• Increase penetration of our existing customer base. We have over 1 million customers worldwide and we intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position as their primary supplier. We believe our offering of a broad range of products, services and support, including software solutions that can help drive improved workflow efficiency and patient communications for practices, coupled with our full-service value proposition, helps us to retain and grow our customer base.

• Increase the number of customers we serve. This strategy includes increasing the productivity of our field sales consultants and telesales team, as well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts in all of our operating segments. In the dental business, we provide products and services to independent practices, mid-market groups, and large DSOs as well as community health centers and government sites of care. Leveraging our broad array of assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these new markets. In the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers located in settings outside of the traditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail, occupational health and home health settings. As settings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners and providing them with the products and services they need.

• Leverage our value-added products and services. We continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key product lines utilizing a consultative selling process. In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental software users and our dental distribution customers. In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to health care practitioners, as well as cross-selling EHR systems and software when we sell our core products. Our strategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks and other large group and multi-site health care organizations, including physician clinics, these same value added products and services. As physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased access to opportunities for cross-marketing and selling our product and service portfolios.

• Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Our acquisition strategy is focused on investments in companies that add new customers and sales teams, increase our geographic footprint (whether entering a new country, such as emerging markets, or building scale where we have already invested in businesses), and finally, those that enable us to access new products and technologies.

Markets Served 

Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using health care services. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s International Database, between 2021 and 2031, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 11%. Between 2021 and 2041, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 22%. This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 7% between 2021 and 2031 and approximately 12% between 2021 and 2041. 

In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45-and-older segment of the population increases. There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates. At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage.

In the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’ offices and home health settings, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us. There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings. We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.

8
We support our dental and medical professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency. 

Additionally, we seek to expand our dental full-service model and medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. We do this through both direct sales and by partnering with local distribution companies.

For information on revenues and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 3 – Segment and Geographic Data of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.” 

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results

We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.

Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations. Sales and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine) purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners for certain products (including equipment and software) and year-end promotions. Sales and profitability may also be impacted by the timing of certain annual and biennial dental tradeshows where equipment promotions are offered. In addition, some dental practices delay equipment purchases in the U.S. until year-end due to tax incentives. We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.

Governmental Regulations

We strive to be compliant with the applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, and believe we have effective compliance programs and other controls in place to ensure substantial compliance. However, compliance is not guaranteed either now or in the future, as certain laws, regulations and guidance may be subject to varying and evolving interpretations that could affect our ability to comply, as well as future changes, additions and enforcement approaches, including political changes. President Biden’s administration (the “Biden Administration”) has indicated that it will be more aggressive in its pursuit of alleged violations of law, and it has revoked certain guidance that would have limited governmental use of informal agency guidance to pursue potential violations, as well as that it was more prepared to pursue individuals for corporate law violations, including an aggressive approach to anti-corruption activities. Changes to applicable laws, regulations and guidance described below, as well as related administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to update or revise our operations, services, marketing practices and compliance programs and controls, and may impose additional and unforeseen costs on us, pose new or previously immaterial risks to us, or may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.

Government

Certain of our businesses involve the distribution, importation, exportation, marketing and sale of, and third party payment for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard, we are subject to extensive local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations, including as applicable to our wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and as part of our specialty home medical supply business that distributes and sells medical equipment and supplies directly to patients. The federal government and state governments have also increased enforcement activity in the health care sector, particularly in areas of fraud and abuse, anti-bribery and corruption, controlled substances handling, medical device regulations and data privacy and security standards. 

Government and private insurance programs fund a large portion of the total cost of medical care, and there have been efforts to limit such private and government insurance programs, including efforts, thus far unsuccessful, to seek repeal of the entire United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2010, (as amended, the “ACA”). In addition, activities to control medical costs, including laws and regulations lowering reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals, medical devices and/or medical treatments or services, are ongoing. Many of these laws and regulations are subject to change and their evolving implementation may impact our operations and our financial performance.

9
Our businesses are also generally subject to numerous other laws and regulations that could impact our financial performance, including securities, antitrust, consumer protection, anti-bribery and anti-kickback, customer interaction transparency, data privacy, data security, government contracting, price gouging and other laws and regulations. 

Failure to comply with laws, rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Operating, Security and Licensure Standards

Certain of our businesses are subject to local, state and federal governmental laws and regulations relating to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices and supplies. Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDC Act”), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, as well as laws regulating the billing of and reimbursement from government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and from commercial payers. We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.

The FDC Act, the Controlled Substances Act, their implementing regulations, and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, marketing and promotion, sampling, pricing and reimbursement, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, returning or recalling, reporting, and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state. Furthermore, Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the introduction, transmission or spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”

The Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements. Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), is being phased in over a period of ten years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system by November 27, 2023, that will identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. The law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and continues to be implemented. The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt certain state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements.

The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third-party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the eventual creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities. The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs. The DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information. According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area. Current state licensing requirements concerning wholesalers will remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA. In addition, with respect to our specialty home medical supply business, we are subject to certain state licensure laws (including state pharmacy laws), and also certain accreditation standards, including to qualify for reimbursement from Medicare and other third-party payers.

The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (“UDI”) system. The UDI rule phased in the implementation of the UDI regulations, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices. Most compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with a final set of requirements for low risk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which will complete the phase in. However, in May 2021, the FDA issued an enforcement policy stating that it does not intend to object to the use of legacy identification

10
numbers on device labels and packages for finished devices manufactured and labeled prior to September 24, 2023. The UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices (including, but not limited to, certain software that qualifies as a medical device under FDA rules), and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs. The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database. The UDI regulations and subsequent FDA guidance regarding the UDI requirements provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions. For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files). Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label and include certain of our businesses.

Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) permitting us to handle controlled substances. We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, reporting, record-keeping and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times. We are subject to inspection by the DEA. Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies, depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale. These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment. 

In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue. We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products. The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.

EU Regulation of Medicinal and Dental Products 

European Union (“EU”) member states regulate their own healthcare systems, as does EU law. The latter regulates certain matters, most notably medicinal products and medical devices. Medicinal products are defined, broadly, as substances or combinations of substances having certain functionalities and may not include medical devices. EU “regulations” apply in all Member States, whereas “directives” are implemented by the individual laws of member states. 

On medicines for humans, we are regulated under Directive No. 2001/83/EC of 6 November 2001, as amended by Directive 2003/63/EC of 25 June 2003, and EU Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004 of 31 March 2004. These rules provide for the authorization of products, and regulate their manufacture, importation, marketing and distribution. It implements requirements which may be implemented without warning, as well as a national pharmacovigilance system under which marketing authorizations may be withdrawn, and includes potential sanctions for breaches of the rules, and on other bases such as harmfulness or inefficiency. 

EU Regulation No. 1223/2009 of 30 November 2009 on cosmetic products requires that cosmetic products (which includes dental products) be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use and comply with certain obligations which apply to manufacturer, importer and distributor. It includes market surveillance, and non-compliance may result in the recall or withdrawal of products, along with other sanctions. 

11
In the EU, the EU Medical Device Regulation No. 2017/745 of 5 April 2017 (“EU MDR”) covers a wide scope of our activities, from dental material to X-ray machines, and certain software. It was meant to become applicable three years after publication (i.e., May 26, 2020). However, on April 23, 2020, to allow European Economic Area (“EEA”) national authorities, notified bodies, manufacturers and other actors to focus fully on urgent priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the European Council and Parliament adopted Regulation 2020/561, postponing the date of application of the EU MDR by one year (to May 26, 2021). 

The EU MDR significantly modifies and intensifies the regulatory compliance requirements for the medical device industry as a whole. Among other things, the EU MDR:

• strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforces surveillance once they are available;

• establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;

• improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number;

• sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; 

• strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo an additional check by experts before they are placed on the market; and

• identifies importers and distributors and medical device products through registration in a database (EUDAMED not due until May 26, 2022 and after). 

In particular, the EU MDR imposes stricter requirements for the confirmation that a product meets the regulatory requirements, including regarding a product’s clinical evaluation and a company’s quality systems, and for the distribution, marketing and sale of medical devices, including post-market surveillance. Medical devices that have been assessed and/or certified under the EU Medical Device Directive may continue to be placed on the market until 2024 (or until the expiry of their certificates, if applicable and earlier); however, requirements regarding the distribution, marketing and sale including quality systems and post-market surveillance have to be observed by manufacturers, importers and distributors as of the application date.

Other EU regulations that may apply under appropriate circumstances include EU Regulation No. 1907/2006 of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals, which requires importers to register substances or mixtures that they import in the EU beyond certain quantities, and the EU Regulation No. 1272/2008 of 16 December 2008 on classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, which sets various obligations with respect to the labelling and packaging of concerned substances and mixtures.

Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to delay product release, sale or distribution, or institute voluntary recalls of, or other corrective action with respect, to products we sell, each of which could result in regulatory and enforcement actions, financial losses and potential reputational harm. Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation, which may affect our interactions with customers, including the design and functionality of our products.

Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions. In addition, certain of our businesses must operate in compliance with a variety of burdensome and complex billing and record-keeping requirements in order to substantiate claims for payment under federal, state and commercial healthcare reimbursement programs. One of these businesses was recently suspended by CMS from receiving payments from Medicare, although it is permitted to continue to perform and bill for Medicare services. The amounts billed are being deposited in an escrow account pending resolution of an audit. The Company has not recognized revenue for these services and has currently deferred slightly over $4 million in revenue.

Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.

12
Antitrust and Consumer Protection

The federal government of the United States, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive, as well as consumer protection laws that seek to protect consumers from improper business practices. At the U.S. federal level, the Federal Trade Commission oversees enforcement of these types of laws, and states have similar government agencies. Violations of antitrust or consumer protection laws may result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Private plaintiffs may also bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages. EU law also regulates competition and provides for detailed rules protecting consumers. The Biden Administration has indicated increased antitrust enforcement and has been more aggressive in enforcement activities.

Health Care Fraud

Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations. Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs. Certain additional state and federal laws, such as the federal Physician Self-Referral Law, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibit physicians and other health professionals from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician (or family member) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services (for example, durable medical equipment and medical supplies), unless an exception applies. Violations of Anti-Kickback Statutes or the Stark Law may be enforced as violations of the federal False Claims Act.

The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under applicable false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries. Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe, including treble damages and substantial civil penalties under the federal False Claims Act, as well as potential loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, criminal penalties, or imposition of a corporate compliance monitor which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties, which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties, as well as other fraud and abuse laws. 

With respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.

We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, or failure to comply with applicable law, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

13
Affordable Care Act and Other Insurance Reform

The ACA increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage. The ACA also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance. 

The ACA has faced frequent legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate and Congressional action seeking to repeal some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. In 2012, the United States Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of the ACA and its individual mandate provision requiring that people buy health insurance or else face a penalty, simultaneously limited ACA provisions requiring Medicaid expansion, making such expansion a state-by-state decision. In addition, one of the major political parties in the United States remains committed to seeking the ACA’s legislative repeal, but legislative efforts to do so have previously failed to pass both chambers of Congress. Under President Trump’s administration, a number of administrative actions were taken to materially weaken the ACA, including, without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the ACA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in 2017, which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions, also effectively repealed the ACA’s individual mandate by zeroing out the penalty for non-compliance. In the most recent ACA litigation, the federal Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found the individual mandate to be unconstitutional, and returned the case to the District Court for the Northern District of Texas for consideration of whether the remainder of the ACA could survive the excision of the individual mandate. The Fifth Circuit’s decision was appealed to the United States Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued a decision on June 17, 2021. Without reaching the merits of the case, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs in the case did not have standing to challenge the ACA. Any outcomes of future cases that change the ACA, in addition to future legislation, regulation, guidance and/or Executive Orders that do the same, could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry. For instance, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 enhanced premium tax credits, which has resulted in an expansion of the number of people covered under the ACA. These changes are time-limited, with some enhancements in place for 2021 only and others available through the end of 2022.

An ACA provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program (the “Sunshine Act”), imposes annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers and distributors with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients (including physicians, dentists, teaching hospitals, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse midwives), and for such manufacturers and distributors and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by covered recipients in the reporting entity. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist, teaching hospital, and non-physician practitioner identities. The Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be unclear. We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers. 

In the United States, government actions to seek to increase health-related price transparency may also affect our business. 

Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework, which modified certain Medicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and other practitioners. Under MACRA, certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models, through which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, promoting interoperability, cost and improvement activities. Data collected in the first MIPS performance year (2017) determined payment adjustments that began January 1, 2019. MACRA standards and payment levels continue to

14
evolve, and reflect a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations. The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace. New state-level payment and delivery system reform programs, including those modeled after such federal programs, are also increasingly being rolled out through Medicaid administrators, as well as through the private sector, which may further alter the marketplace and impact our business. 

Recently, in addition to other government efforts to control health care costs, there has been increased scrutiny on drug pricing and concurrent efforts to control or reduce drug costs by Congress, the President, executive branch agencies and various states. At the state level, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases, while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multi-payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. At the federal level, several related bills have been introduced and regulations proposed which, if enacted or finalized, respectively, would impact drug pricing and related costs.

As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes. We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

EU Directive on the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products 

EU law provides for the regulation of the pricing of medicinal products which are implemented by EU member states (Directive No. 89/105/EC of 21 December 1988 relating to the transparency of measures regulating the pricing of medicinal products for human use and their inclusion in the scope of national health insurance systems). Member states may, subject notably to transparency conditions and to the statement of reasons based upon objective and verifiable criteria, regulate the price charged (or its increases) for authorized medicines and their level of reimbursement, or they may freeze prices, place controls on the profitability of persons responsible for placing medicinal products on the market, and include or exclude the medicine on the list of products covered by national health insurance systems. 

EU law does not expressly include provisions like those of the Sunshine Act in the United States, but a growing number of EU member states (such as France since 2011) have enacted laws to increase the transparency of relationships in the healthcare sector. The scope of these laws varies from one member state to another and may, for example, include the relations between healthcare industry players and physicians or their associations, students preparing for medical professions or their associations, teachers, health establishments or publishers of prescription and dispensing assistance software.

Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records

The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software and digital health products intended for use in health care settings. The 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”), signed into law on December 13, 2016, among other things, amended the medical device definition to exclude certain software from FDA regulation, including clinical decision support software that meets certain criteria. On September 27, 2019, the FDA issued a suite of guidance documents on digital health products, which incorporated applicable Cures Act standards, including regarding the types of clinical decision support tools and other software that are exempt from regulation by the FDA as medical devices, and continues to issue new guidance in this area. Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.

In addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products, and our specialty home medical supply business, include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals. These information technology systems may be

15
vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies. For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, the California Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) that becomes effective on January 1, 2023. Laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection are continually evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. These requirements may not be harmonized, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. Our businesses’ failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation. Also, evolving laws and regulations in this area could restrict the ability of our customers to obtain, use or disseminate patient information, or could require us to incur significant additional costs to re-design our products to reflect these legal requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 

Also, the European Parliament and the Council of the EU adopted the pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in the EU or EEA (“Data Subjects”), including individuals who are our customers, suppliers and employees. The GDPR extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors, and generally imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies, such as us, that offer goods or services to Data Subjects or monitor their behavior (including by companies based outside of Europe). Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues, and Data Subjects may seek damages. Member states may individually impose additional requirements and penalties regarding certain matters, such as employee personal data. With respect to the personal data it protects, the GDPR requires, among other things, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis to process the personal data, breach notifications within 72 hours, data integrity and security, and fairness and transparency regarding the storage, use or other processing of the personal data. The GDPR also provides rights to Data Subjects relating notably to information, access, modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data. 

On August 20, 2021, China promulgated the PRC Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which took effect on November 1, 2021. The PIPL imposes specific rules for processing personal information and it also specifies that the law shall also apply to personal information activities carried out outside China but for the purpose of providing products or services to PRC citizens. Any non-compliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines, orders to rectify or terminate any actions that are deemed illegal by regulatory authorities, other penalties, as well as reputational damage or legal proceedings against us, which may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The PIPL carries maximum penalties of CNY50 million or 5% of the annual revenue of entities that process personal data.

In the United States, the CCPA, which increases the privacy protections afforded California residents, became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA generally requires companies, such as us, to institute additional protections regarding the collection, use and disclosure of certain personal information of California residents. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the CCPA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. Regulations were released in August of 2020, but there remains some uncertainty about how the CCPA will be interpreted by the courts and enforced by the regulators. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties and litigation, any of which may negatively impact our reputation, require us to expend significant resources, and harm our business. Furthermore, California voters approved the CPRA on November 3, 2020, which will amend and expand the CCPA, including by providing consumers with additional rights with respect to their personal information, and creating a new state agency to enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. The CPRA will come into effect on January 1, 2023, applying to information collected by businesses on or after January 1, 2022. 

Other states, as well as the federal government, have increasingly considered the adoption of similarly expansive personal privacy laws, backed by significant civil penalties for non-compliance. Virginia and Colorado were both successful in passing privacy legislation in 2021, becoming effective on January 1, 2023 and July 1, 2023

16
respectively. While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL, and CPRA requirements, our compliance with data privacy and cybersecurity laws is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records. These customers, and we, are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require the protection of the privacy and security of those records, and our products may also be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws. Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products or services to comply with applicable legal or contractual data privacy and security requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.

Various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes. The initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians and dentists, through MIPS, to use EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements, including regarding quality, promoting interoperability, cost and improvement activities. Qualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in evolving standards adopted by CMS and the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology of HHS (“ONC”). Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of such certified EHR systems and other products linked to government supported incentive programs. In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy these changing governmental standards. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, we may be exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act. 

Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, and comply with evolving legal requirements, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex functionality, such as with respect to reporting and information blocking. Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers. Failure to abide by these and other electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.

Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important. As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.

There may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care.

E-Commerce

Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships. Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition. The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings. 

17
Through our proprietary, technologically-based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives. We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business. We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.

International Transactions

United States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products. We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the United States.

While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that laws and regulations that impact our business or laws and regulations as they apply to our customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Proprietary Rights

We hold trademarks relating to the “Henry Schein®” name and logo, as well as certain other trademarks. We intend to protect our trademarks to the fullest extent practicable. 

Employees and Human Capital

At Henry Schein, our employees are our greatest asset. We employ more than 21,600 full-time equivalent employees, including approximately 2,100 telesales representatives, over 3,450 field sales consultants, including equipment sales specialists, 2,175 installation and repair technicians, 3,750 warehouse employees, 950 computer programmers and technicians, 825 management employees and 8,400 office, clerical and administrative employees. Approximately 50% of our workforce is based in the United States and approximately 50% is based outside of the United States. Approximately 13% of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relations with our employees are excellent.

We refer to our employees as Team Schein Members, or “TSMs.” Our TSMs are the cornerstone of the Company. Our success is built on the engagement and commitment of our team, which is dedicated to meeting the needs of our customers, supplier partners, fellow TSMs, stockholders and society. We are committed to supporting the personal and professional development of our TSMs, as well as providing competitive benefits and a safe, inclusive workplace, and believe that these measures help us to retain our TSMs and attract new TSMs. As part of this commitment, among other things we:

• Maintain a strong collaborative workplace culture. We believe our TSMs’ ability to effectively communicate and cooperate across functional and departmental teams positively impacts our performance. Each TSM’s performance is evaluated annually, based on a measure of Team Schein values. Our team’s performance as a whole is evaluated via a culture survey, conducted every two years, distributed to all TSMs, which, among other things, addresses collaboration. The results from our global culture surveys are reviewed by senior leaders, reported to the Board of Directors and used to implement programs and processes designed to further enhance our culture. Our most recent results in 2021 showed a meaningful increase in our collaboration scores from our prior survey. We are currently in the process of further developing our collaborative culture by, among other things, strengthening our existing commitment to diversity and inclusion, as further described below. 

18
• Are committed to enhancing our Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) initiatives. We believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment filled with unique perspectives. As a result, D&I helps us meet the needs of customers around the world and provide our TSMs an inclusive environment that encourages them to be their authentic selves. We collect feedback through hosting roundtables where our senior leaders actively listen to our TSMs on topics related to D&I, and the insights learned are used to guide our efforts to support a diverse and inclusive environment. We measure our success in D&I through, among other things, our global culture survey, where results in 2021 showed D&I is our top strength out of 14 focus areas. To guide our efforts and education related to D&I, our Diversity and Inclusion Council, with engagement from our Board of Directors and Executive Management Committee, drives the Company’s overall D&I strategy. We continue to enhance our D&I learning journey, educating global managers on key D&I topics including unconscious bias, leading inclusively, privilege and equity. We also continue to educate our global TSMs on the importance of D&I. Additionally, we promote engagement by utilizing our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) as an inclusive and diverse vehicle for all TSMs to share, connect, learn and develop both personally and professionally. Each of our ERGs has a sponsor from our Executive Management Committee and our Board of Directors and our CEO engages directly in many of our ERG programs. We believe that these efforts will serve as a critical steppingstone as we continue to strengthen our D&I initiatives in an effort to meet the evolving needs of our customers, supplier partners, TSMs, stockholders and society.

• Strive to create a culture of wellness. In 2020, we launched a Mental Wellness Committee with a mission to empower every TSM to be their best self, mentally, emotionally and physically. The Committee provides resources, guidance and support, and works across our businesses to establish enhanced workplace norms to help improve and preserve our TSMs’ wellness. We actively engage leadership, including our CEO, Executive Management Committee, Board of Directors, and TSMs alike in conversations around the importance of wellness in the workplace. Our Mental Wellness Committee’s four main areas of focus include (i) culture (with a focus to create recommendations and rules of engagement to prioritize wellness), (ii) education (with a focus to ensure we are delivering relevant education sessions around the importance of mental wellness), (iii) resources (to ensure we are continuously reviewing the resources available to support our TSMs’ wellbeing and ensure they are easily accessible on an internal microsite), and (iv) communications (to help remove the stigma around mental health and raise awareness of the importance of wellness as a whole). 

• Are committed to the professional development of our TSMs. Personal and professional development of our TSMs is important to us. As such, we invest in our employees by providing both formal and informal learning opportunities that are focused on growing and enhancing knowledge, skills and abilities. TSMs globally are offered a broad suite of professional development training programs targeted to specific learning opportunities based on their current and potential future role within the Company. We also offer over 50 organizational and development training courses designed to aid in the overall development and advancement of skills and competencies to enable organizational success. Executive education and mentorship and coaching programs also form an important part of our development and career support initiatives. Additionally, we measure growth and development as part of our global culture survey, where results in 2021 showed a meaningful increase in our score from our prior survey with respect to our work to foster the professional growth of our TSMs. 

• Support talent development and succession planning. Talent planning efforts are an integral part of our commitment to ensure a strong leadership pipeline across the organization. Through a formal global process, we strategically identify and develop talent leads through targeted development opportunities and intentional succession plans. We continuously identify a group of potential management successors as part of our succession planning process. Information derived from talent planning efforts informs curriculum design and content to help focus on the right capabilities and help ensure alignment of career development efforts with the future needs of the organization. Our Board of Directors is provided with periodic updates regarding our talent and succession planning efforts, participates in professional development activities with our TSMs and receives formal documentation on these topics annually. 

• Support TSM health and safety. We offer competitive health and wellness programs and other benefits to eligible TSMs. In addition to employee health and wellness benefits, we are committed to providing a safe 

19
and secure work environment for all TSMs. In connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to update our policies and procedures, as appropriate, to implement health and safety protocols to help protect our TSMs and customers. While TSMs at our manufacturing and distribution facilities, as well as field sales consultants and equipment service technicians, have continued to work onsite or in the field to provide vital services to our customers, most TSMs in administrative office-based functions have effectively worked remotely since the start of the pandemic. We continue to stay up-to-date with the federal, state and local mandates, and CDC and WHO guidelines to help ensure we are implementing proper health and safety protocols for all TSMs. We communicate such updates to our TSMs. The team also continues to hold virtual Global Town Halls for all TSMs to focus on critical business updates.
