PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

Overview

C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (“C.H. Robinson,” “the company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is one of the largest global logistics companies in the world with consolidated total revenues of $23.1 billion in 2021. We transform the way the world moves, improving the global supply chain through our people, processes, and technology. We are driven to provide exceptional experience to our customers and suppliers by providing freight transportation services and logistics solutions to companies of all sizes in a wide variety of industries. In 2021, we handled approximately 20 million shipments and worked with approximately 100,000 customers. Operating throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and South America we offer a global suite of services using tailored, market-leading differentiated technology built by and for our global network of supply chain experts working with our customers to drive better outcomes by leveraging our experience, data, technology, and scale. Our EDGE values are the core of our strategy and drive us to Evolve constantly, Deliver excellence, Grow together, and Embrace integrity. 

As a global logistics platform, we connect across continents by partnering with a wide variety of transportation companies and utilizing those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight. In 2021, our customers turned to us to find solutions to problems they had never experienced before in the supply chain industry. We utilized approximately 85,000 contracted transportation companies around the world, including contracted motor carriers, railroads (primarily intermodal service providers), and ocean and air carriers in 2021. Our employees, technology, and product portfolio enable us to provide a differentiated experience, remaining flexible and providing solutions that optimize service for our customers. As an integral part of our transportation services, we also provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as freight consolidation, customs brokerage, supply chain consulting and analysis, emission analytics, optimization, and reporting. 

In addition to transportation and logistics services, we also provide sourcing services under the trade name Robinson Fresh® (“Robinson Fresh”). Our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. The foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to this original business, founded in 1905, which gives us significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities. We supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers. Our customers include grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many cases, we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services, such as replenishment, category management, and managed procurement services. We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and value-added produce under recognized consumer brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers.

Segment information. We have two reportable segments: North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) and Global Forwarding with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate. The All Other and Corporate segment includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Services, Other Surface Transportation outside of North America, and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. See additional disclosure in Note 9, Segment Reporting, to our consolidated financial statements. 

NAST provides transportation and logistics services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST are truckload and less than truckload (“LTL”) transportation brokerage services. 

Global Forwarding provides transportation and logistics services through an international network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and South America; and also contracts with independent agents worldwide. The primary services provided by Global Forwarding include ocean freight services, air freight services, and customs brokerage.

Transportation and Logistics Services

C.H. Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services. Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships. We execute these service commitments by investing in and retaining talented employees, developing innovative proprietary systems and processes, and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers, including, but not limited to, contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We make a profit driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to handle or transport the freight. 

We provide the following transportation and logistics services:

•Truckload: Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. Through the use of Navisphere, we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types, and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment.

•LTL: LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight. We primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and use of Navisphere, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight. In many instances, we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads.

•Ocean: As a licensed Non-Vessel Ocean Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) and freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, and/or provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments.

•Air: As a certified Indirect Air Carrier (“IAC”) and freight forwarder, we organize air shipments and provide door-to-door service.

•Customs: Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting regulatory and operational requirements governing imports and exports. 

•Other Logistics Services: We provide intermodal transportation service, which is the shipment of freight in containers or trailers by a combination of truck and rail. In addition, we provide fee-based Managed Services, warehousing services, small parcel, and other services.

Customers communicate their freight needs, typically on an order-by-order basis, to the C.H. Robinson team responsible for their account, either directly or through highly automated connections established between Navisphere and the customers' transportation management system. The C.H. Robinson team then ensures that all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in Navisphere. We utilize the information from Navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based upon factors such as their service score, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. 

Once the contracted carrier is selected, we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation. During the time when a shipment is executed, we connect frequently, either electronically or manually, with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers. 

For most of our transportation and logistics services, we are a service provider. By accepting the customer’s order, we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carrier’s contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges. In the cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims. In our Managed Services business, we are acting as the shipper’s agent. In those cases, the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer, and we collect a fee for our services.

As a result of our logistics capabilities, our technology, our global suite of services, and available modes of transportation, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation requirements. Our employees price 

4
our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer. Our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market, or transactional basis, or prearranged contractual rates. Most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation. As is typical in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments. When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers, we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a pass-through cost, in addition to the underlying line-haul portion of the rate.

We purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market, or transactional basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. In some cases, we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract or to provide transportation services within dense transportation lanes. In those cases, where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers, there is typically a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreed-upon formula.

While providing day-to-day transportation services, our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains. We offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We analyze customers’ current transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims. We help customers minimize storage through crossdocking and other flow-through operations. Many of these services are provided in connection with providing the transportation services based on the nature of the customer relationship. In addition to these transportation services, we may also provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as freight consolidation, customs brokerage, supply chain consulting and analysis, emission analytics, optimization, and reporting, for which we are usually paid separately.

We have broadened our relationship with many of our customers through an emphasis on integrated logistics solutions resulting in us managing a greater portion of their supply chains. We often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations. Our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network. 

Transportation services accounted for approximately 97 percent of adjusted gross profit in 2021 and 96 percent of adjusted gross profit in 2020 and 2019. Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

The table below shows our adjusted gross profit by transportation mode, for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sourcing

Since we were founded in 1905, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be rapidly packaged; carefully transported within tight timetables, usually in temperature controlled equipment; and quickly distributed to replenish high-turnover inventories maintained by our customers. In many instances, we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations. Our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers.

Our sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment, brand management, and category development services. We have various national and regional branded produce programs, including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed brands. These programs contain a wide variety of high quality, fresh bulk, and value-added fruits and vegetables. These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality 

5
assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs. Sourcing accounted for approximately three percent of our adjusted gross profit in 2021 and four percent of our adjusted gross profit in 2020 and 2019. 

Customer Relationships

We work to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services and people they can rely on. During 2021, we served approximately 100,000 customers worldwide, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. During 2021, our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of total revenues. In recent years, we have grown by adding new customers and by increasing our volumes with, and providing more services to, our existing customers.

We seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace, our unique information advantage, and the range of logistics services that we can provide. We believe that our account management disciplines, expertise, and technology built by and for supply chain experts, enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep, data-driven, understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and certain vertical industries. 

Markets and Resources

Competition 

The transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against many logistics companies, including technology-based service companies, trucking companies, property freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, NVOCCs, IACs, and freight forwarders. We also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us.

In our sourcing business, we compete with produce brokers, produce growers, produce marketing companies, produce wholesalers, and foodservice buying groups. We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us.

We often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are:

•People: Our knowledgeable, dedicated, and empowered people act as an extension of our customers’ teams—logistics experts they can rely on—to innovate and execute their supply chain strategies;

•Technology: Navisphere, our proprietary technology, provides flexibility, global visibility, customized solutions, easy integration, broad connectivity, and advanced security;

•Information: Our global suite of services, unparalleled quantity of relationships, and scale combine to provide us with an industry leading data estate. We have one of the largest datasets of shipments, routings, and carriers in the world. We use our industry-leading data and data analysts to drive smarter solutions for our customers; and 

•Stability: Our customers and our contract carriers rely on us to support critical elements of their business. Our financial strength, discipline, and consistent track record of success are a key foundation of our ability to sustainably meet their needs.

Proprietary Information Technology and Intellectual Property 

Most of our global network operates on a single global technology platform called Navisphere that is used to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate with other offices, and to utilize centralized support resources to complete all facets of the transaction. Our technology and software platform is essential to serve our customers and contracted carriers, and to manage our business. In 2021, we executed approximately 20 million shipments for approximately 100,000 customers with approximately 85,000 contracted carriers.

Navisphere and our other operational systems help our employees service customer orders, select the optimal mode of transportation, build and consolidate shipments, identify appropriate carriers, and manage exceptions, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our data estate and scale provides our organization with the necessary business intelligence to allow for the necessary decision support in all areas of our business.

We have committed to investing in our technology to bring the value of technology, data, and analytics to our customers, help solve their most complex logistics challenges and drive the industry forward. With approximately 1,300 data scientists, engineers, and developers, we are continuing to invest in global talent in this critical area, building the next generation of tools and processes that will change how supply chains function.

C.H. Robinson® Labs™ (“Robinson Labs”) is part of this commitment. It is an innovation incubator where the next big ideas in logistics and supply chain are created, tested, and scaled to drive smarter solutions for our customers and contracted carriers. The Robinson Labs team collaborates with customers to solve their logistics challenges with technology built by and for supply chain experts. Industry-first tools launched by Robinson Labs in 2021 include:

•Procure IQ®, which uses an algorithm built by our data scientists and the largest freight shipment dataset in the industry to show shippers the optimal way to purchase transportation in each of their shipping lanes;

•Emissions IQ™, which gives shippers instant visibility into their carbon emissions and surfaces opportunities for reduction; and

•Market Rate IQ™, which reveals the patterns in a shipper’s spot freight that they could change to save money 

Our operations primarily use Navisphere, our global, multimodal transportation management system that allows customers to communicate worldwide with parties in their supply chain across languages, currencies, and continents. Navisphere offers sophisticated business analytics, artificial intelligence, and data-driven tools to improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands including the following tools:

•Navisphere Vision allows our customers to see their freight across all modes and services globally in a single view. Details of shipment contents, shipment status, disruptions to shipments, and resulting adjustment to estimated time of arrival using artificial intelligence are provided for the customer to manage their supply chain exceptions. Collaboration, intelligent notifications, and performance scorecards allow customers to manage their supply chain and identify inefficiencies.

•Navisphere Insight takes a customer’s raw data about their freight and uses data science to turn it into valuable insights, surfacing trends in transportation performance, and spend that can be used for decision-making in real time or over time. Analysis is provided down to the shipment and order level.

•Navisphere Optimizer helps customers minimize the travel time, distance, and total miles of their freight, while maximizing their trailer utilization and savings. It is used during the transportation planning process and dynamically selects the right route with the right mode and right carrier on the right day. 

Navisphere is also integrated into an industry-leading 23 third-party transportation management systems and/or enterprise resource planning systems, allowing our dynamic pricing engine to directly deliver real-time quotes to customers when they have freight to be picked up or delivered. This eliminates the need for our customers to shop around and provides an automated solution.

The Navisphere Carrier (“Navisphere Carrier”) platform provides contracted motor carriers access to the functionality necessary to efficiently manage their relationship with C.H. Robinson. Contracted motor carriers can search and book available freight, provide online status updates, keep track of receivables, and upload scanned documentation. Many of our contracted motor carriers’ favorite features from Navisphere Carrier are also available through our Navisphere Carrier mobile application for Android® and iOS® mobile operating systems. 

7
The Navisphere Driver mobile application provides contracted motor carriers’ drivers with load status automation capabilities. Drivers can elect to allow the application to automate location services and updates while in transit. Drivers can also capture and upload bill of lading documentation to initiate payment processes. The track and trace capabilities give our systems and customers frequent load status information. 

Freightquote® by C.H. Robinson is a web-based, mobile-responsive offering designed to streamline the shipping process for small business customers, allowing the booking of freight without any shipping knowledge or expertise. Freightquote's small business customers can go online with their smart phone, tablet, or computer to book their LTL or truckload freight, track shipments, get proactive notifications, and pay for transportation services with a credit card.

We rely on a combination of cyber-security, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. Additionally, we have numerous registered trademarks, trade names, and logos in the United States and internationally.

Relationships with Transportation Providers

We continually work on establishing contractual relationships with qualified transportation providers that also meet both ours and our customers’ service requirements to provide dependable services, favorable pricing, and available capacity during periods when demand for transportation equipment is greater than the supply. We own very little transportation equipment and do not employ the people directly involved with the delivery of our customers’ freight, so these relationships are critical to our success.

In 2021, we worked with approximately 85,000 transportation providers worldwide, of which the vast majority are contracted motor carriers. To strengthen and maintain our relationships with contracted motor carriers, our employees regularly communicate with them and try to assist them by increasing their equipment utilization, reducing their empty miles, and repositioning their equipment. To make it easier for contracted motor carriers to work with us, we have a policy of contracted motor carrier invoice payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in accordance with our standard payment terms. For those contracted motor carriers that would like a faster payment, we also offer expedited payment upon receipt of proof of delivery in exchange for a discount, along with offering in-trip cash advances. 

Contracted motor carriers provide access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. These contracted motor carriers are of all sizes, including owner-operators of a single truck, small and mid-size fleets, private fleets, and the largest national trucking companies. Consequently, we are not dependent on any one contracted motor carrier. Our largest truck transportation provider was less than two percent of our total cost of transportation in 2021. Contracted motor carriers that had fewer than 100 trucks transported approximately 82 percent of our truckload shipments in 2021. Every United States and Canadian motor carrier we do business with is required to execute a contract that establishes the motor carrier is acting as an independent contractor. At the time the contract is executed, and thereafter, through subscriptions with a third-party service, we confirm that each United States contracted motor carrier is properly licensed and insured, has the necessary federally-issued authority to provide transportation services, and can provide the necessary level of service on a dependable basis. Our motor carrier contracts require that the contracted motor carrier issue invoices only to and accept payment solely from us for the shipments that they transport under their contract with us and allow us to withhold payment to satisfy previous claims or shortages. Our standard contracts do not include volume commitments, and typically the initial contract rate is modified each time we confirm an individual shipment with a contracted motor carrier.

In our NVOCC ocean transportation business, we have contracts with most of the major ocean carriers, which support a variety of service and rate needs for our customers. We negotiate annual contracts that establish the predetermined rates we agree to pay the ocean carriers. The rates are negotiated based on expected volumes from our customers in specific trade lanes. These contracts are often amended throughout the year to reflect changes in market conditions for our business, such as additional trade lanes.

8
We operate both as a consolidator and as a transactional IAC in the United States and internationally. We select air carriers and provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments. We execute our air freight services through our relationships with air carriers, through charter services, block space agreements, capacity space agreements, and transactional spot market negotiations. Through charter services, we contract part or all of an airplane to meet customer requirements. Our block space agreements and capacity space agreements are contracts for a defined time period. The contracts include fixed allocations for predetermined flights at agreed upon rates that are reviewed periodically throughout the year. The transactional negotiations afford us the ability to capture excess capacity at prevailing market rates for a specific shipment.

Seasonality

Our operating results have been subject to seasonal trends as a result of, or influenced by, numerous factors, including national holidays, weather patterns, consumer demand, economic conditions, and other similar and subtle forces. Although seasonal changes in the transportation industry have not had a significant impact on our cash flow or results of operations, we expect this trend to continue and we cannot guarantee that it will not adversely impact us in the future. 

Government Regulation

Our operations may be regulated and licensed by various federal, state, and local transportation agencies in the United States and similar governmental agencies in foreign countries in which we operate. 

We are subject to licensing and regulation as a property freight broker and are licensed by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) to arrange for the transportation of property by motor vehicle. The DOT prescribes qualifications for acting in this capacity, including certain surety bonding requirements. We are also subject to regulation by the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”) as an ocean freight forwarder and NVOCC; we maintain separate bonds and licenses for each. We operate as a Department of Homeland Security certified IAC, providing air freight services, subject to commercial standards set forth by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) and federal regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”). We provide customs brokerage services as a customs broker under a license issued by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies. We also have and maintain other licenses as required by law.

Although Congress enacted legislation in 1994 that substantially preempts the authority of states to exercise economic regulation of motor carriers and brokers of freight, some intrastate shipments for which we arrange transportation may be subject to additional licensing, registration, or permit requirements. We contractually require and rely on the motor carrier transporting the shipment to ensure compliance with these types of requirements. We, along with the contracted motor carriers that we rely on in arranging transportation services for our customers, are also subject to a variety of federal and state safety and environmental regulations. Although compliance with the regulations governing licensees in these areas has not had a materially adverse effect on our operations or financial condition in the past, there can be no assurance that such regulations or changes thereto will not adversely impact our operations in the future. Violation of these regulations could also subject us to fines, as well as increased claims liability.

We buy and sell fresh produce under licenses issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) as required by the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (“PACA”). Other sourcing and distribution activities may be subject to various federal and state food and drug statutes and regulations. 

We are subject to a variety of other U.S. and foreign laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption statutes. 

We are subject to laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries concerning the handling of personal information, including laws that require us to notify governmental authorities and/or affected individuals of data breaches involving certain personal information. These laws and regulations include, for example, the European General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Regulatory actions or litigation seeking to impose significant penalties could be brought against us in the event of a data breach or alleged non-compliance with such laws and regulations.

Human Capital

At C.H. Robinson, our employees literally connect the world. They are logistics experts and problem solvers, and they act as an extension of our customers' teams. In fact, our customers and contract carriers consistently cite our people as one of the top reasons they work with C.H. Robinson. Our talent strategy is built on our EDGE values: Evolve constantly, Deliver excellence, Grow together, and Embrace integrity. We attract and retain the right talent by creating an inclusive, high-performing culture and engage employees with meaningful work at a place where they belong, can grow, and are proud to work. We leverage the diverse perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences of our global network of supply chain experts to create innovative solutions and better meet the needs of our customers, contract carriers, and growers. 

Oversight and Governance

Our Board of Directors and Talent and Compensation Committee have oversight of our human capital management and diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) efforts. They receive regular updates from our Chief Human Resources and Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Officer on our key strategic initiatives, success measurements, and other relevant matters pertaining to human resources and DEI including, but not limited to, hiring and retention, culture, employee engagement, succession planning, compensation and benefits, and human resources or DEI-related risks.

Our People

As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 16,877 employees, 14,554 of whom are network employees, as presented below. Our remaining employees support our network teams in areas such as finance, product, information technology, software engineering, data science and analysis, legal, marketing, and human resources. The following table illustrates our employees by global region:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)

We believe that fostering an inclusive, equitable, and diverse workforce is core to our EDGE values as well as a business imperative. The unique experiences and backgrounds of our people create a stronger, more innovative, and successful team. We bring our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion to life by integrating our DEI strategic pillars (workplace diversity, workforce inclusivity, partnerships, and accountability) across our talent strategies and into our business. 

As a global company, we think broadly about DEI and value all dimensions of diversity. To help us evaluate progress against our strategy, we track a number of DEI metrics that are reviewed regularly and reported to our senior leadership teams on a quarterly basis. Additionally, we have identified aspirational goals to be met by 2025 that focus on hiring, retention, engagement, and leadership representation for women (globally) and people of color (U.S. only). Some of these metrics are summarized below as of December 31, 2021. Additional information can be found in our annual ESG report.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

10
We have active and engaged Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) that foster employee connections across the world, provide learning, engagement, and development opportunities, and partner with human resources and DEI teams to help advance our work. Currently, each of our six ERGs has an average of 800 employee members. Additionally, in 2021, we rolled out inclusivity training to all employees around the world, hosted our first Global Inclusion Week, created targeted resources for managers to support inclusive leadership behaviors, and donated to support nonprofit organizations aligned with our DEI goals.

Talent Acquisition, Engagement, and Retention 

Our continued success depends on our ability to hire and retain talented team members who can bring their unique backgrounds to work. To support our hiring processes, we develop a robust, diverse pipeline of qualified candidates, then collaborate across the organization to best understand our talent needs and place the right person in each role. We recognize that 2021 brought an increasingly tight talent market and a shift toward a more flexible workplace. To adapt to these changes, we are investing more in recruitment marketing, added recruiter headcount, broadened our talent searches geographically, and increased passive candidate sourcing. We also enhanced our recruiting and hiring processes to create an even more inclusive candidate experience and address any potential unconscious biases. 

Our employee turnover ratio, which is calculated as the number of employees who departed the Company in the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, divided by the average number of employees in the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, was 19 percent. Our employee turnover ratio is up from a historically low level in 2020 fueled by the pandemic, but is in line with pre-pandemic employee turnover rates. Current labor market conditions compound the impact of turnover so to improve our retention rate, we are addressing the top reasons that employees stay, including compensation, work-life balance, flexibility, DEI, and career growth opportunities. 

We regularly survey our employees and engage in focus groups to better understand what our people value and where we can intentionally improve their experience. Over the past year, we’ve continued to hear that our employees value our flexible work options, the stability that comes with a 116 year-old company, and our support for their overall well-being. In our 2021 employee engagement survey, 81 percent of our employees scored favorable to feeling optimistic about the future of C.H. Robinson, exceeding the benchmark score by 6 percent. Our focus on DEI continues to build a greater sense of belonging in our workplace, which is seen through an increase in favorability in our 2021 survey responses. In addition, our focus on creating more transparency into career opportunities at C.H. Robinson is enabling more visibility to what’s possible for our employees. The 2021 survey indicated a positive engagement score of 80 percent, which was consistent with benchmark companies.

Onboarding and Development 

C.H. Robinson is a place where employees can develop their best selves while achieving their goals. New employees go through an onboarding process that emphasizes the skills necessary to become productive employees, including technology training on our proprietary systems and our customer service philosophy, as well as understanding our company culture and values. We continue to adapt our onboarding, training, and development programs to meet the needs of the business and adjust to the new hybrid workplace. We believe that continuous talent development and succession planning are critical to our success. Onboarding is followed by ongoing, on-the-job training and regular performance and career development conversations between employees and their managers. In 2021, approximately 98 percent of our workforce received regular performance and career development reviews.

We have established targeted development programs including the Leadership Networking Circle, a program designed to develop female leaders, a sponsorship program to champion growth of our employees of color and female employees, and a Key Account Sales program to grow our strategic selling capabilities.  

We believe that an employee's relationship with their leader is a key driver of retention and employee engagement. It has also long been a signature strength at C.H. Robinson. In our 2021 employee engagement survey, employee favorability of manager effectiveness increased 2 percent to 82 percent, surpassing our benchmark score by 9 percent. We continued to build on the strength of our managers as we introduced new leadership principles in 2021 as our shared understanding of what it means to lead at C.H. Robinson and how we drive exceptional results and develop our people for the future. The principles are unique to us and aligned with our company strategy, mission, vision, and EDGE values. They are embedded in who we are and how we lead. To demonstrate this, we have integrated them into our development tools, leadership programs, performance plans, and how we hold each other accountable every day. 

11
Wellness, Compensation, and Benefits

At C.H. Robinson, we care about all areas of our employees’ lives. Our total rewards strategies help employees improve their health, wealth, and self. We also established communication channels for employees to connect and stay informed on wellness topics, and we offer employee assistance programs and mental health resources. As we continue to navigate these unprecedented times through the COVID-19 pandemic, we have followed guidance from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, World Health Organization, and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure the safety of our people. Where the work allows, employees have the flexibility to work where they can be the most productive and safe. 

A highly competitive benefits package rounds out our efforts to fully support employees’ health, wealth, and self. We review our benefits on an annual basis to ensure they stay competitive in the marketplace, as well as incorporate the voice of our employees to ensure we evolve to meet the diverse needs of our people. 

Our market-competitive compensation programs help drive performance and reward success. We work to ensure equitable compensation and in 2021, completed a pay equity analysis. Compensation plans include performance-based metrics and short-term incentive (“STI”) plans directly tied to productivity, the achievement of performance goals, and the financial performance of the team or the organization. Senior managers are paid a performance-based bonus, which is measured based on balanced growth in the adjusted gross profit and operating income performance of the team they represent. In order to strengthen our commitment to DEI, senior leadership have a portion of their STI tied to advancing DEI strategy. 

Our equity compensation program is an important part of how we stay competitive, as it incentivizes and rewards leadership for enterprise performance. We believe the program further contributes to our success as it helps to create long-term ownership and alignment between employees and our shareholders. Some employees who have significant responsibilities are eligible to receive equity awards through our equity compensation program. Our equity compensation philosophy is to pay for performance and reward profitable long-term growth. The program is designed to support our business transformation and company culture, help attract top talent, and create alignment with our shareholders. Refer to Note 6, Capital Stock and Stock Award Plans, for further discussion related to our equity award plan design. 

Community Engagement

Giving back to our communities and supporting non-profit organizations, inspires and engages our employees and are core to our culture. We proudly support our people, our industry, and our communities around the world. Through our company and the C.H.

In 2021, approximately $1.3 million was donated through our employee match program, and our employees volunteered approximately 4,500 hours to help the causes they care about most. 

In addition to our employee-driven philanthropy, we support disaster relief efforts, grantmaking, employee hardship funds, and scholarship programs for our employees and our contract carriers. We focus on supporting basic needs including preventing hunger and providing housing and education, as well as organizations working to remove barriers and diversify the talent pipeline within our industry. 

Environmental Sustainability 

C.H. Robinson is committed to reducing our own environmental footprint, while helping to support sustainability efforts in our industry and for our customers. On a regular basis, we engage with our internal and external stakeholders to identify our priority ESG topics, including environmental sustainability. Our Chief Human Resources and ESG Officer and VP of ESG provide annual updates to the Board of Directors and Governance Committee on our most critical ESG topics. The full results of these engagements and more information is available in our annual ESG report, which includes indices for the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. 

In addition to tracking and managing our own environmental footprint, we leverage our scope, size, and scale to help customers optimize their supply chain and eliminate empty miles on the road in order to meet their sustainability goals. Our ESG goals and accomplishments include:

•Reducing our emissions intensity - We are committed to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have set a science-aligned below 2°C goal to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 carbon intensity. By the end of 2021, we were more than halfway to our goal. To achieve this goal, we seek energy efficiencies within our operations and potentially other alternatives such as purchasing energy credits. 

•Launching Emissions IQ - Emissions IQ helps shippers measure their Scope 3 transportation emissions, giving them critical visibility into their value chain necessary to meet their sustainability goals. Emissions IQ applies the Global Logistics Emissions Framework and is accredited by the Smart Freight Centre.
