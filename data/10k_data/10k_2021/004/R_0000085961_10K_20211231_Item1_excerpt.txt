PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

OVERVIEW

Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a leading logistics and transportation company. We provide supply chain, dedicated transportation, and commercial fleet management solutions. We report our financial performance based on three business segments: (1) Fleet Management Solutions (FMS), which provides full service leasing and leasing with flexible maintenance options, commercial rental and maintenance services of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the United States (U.S.), Canada and the United Kingdom (U.K.); (2) Supply Chain Solutions (SCS), which provides integrated logistics solutions, including distribution management, dedicated transportation, transportation management, e-commerce and last mile, and professional services in North America; and (3) Dedicated Transportation Solutions (DTS), which provides turnkey transportation solutions in the U.S., including dedicated vehicles, drivers, management, and administrative support. Dedicated transportation services provided as part of an operationally integrated, multi-service, supply chain solution to SCS customers are primarily reported in the SCS business segment.

MISSION AND STRATEGY

Ryder's mission is to provide innovative fleet management and supply chain solutions that are reliable, safe and efficient, enabling our customers to deliver on their promises. Our primary strategy is to accelerate growth in our less capital intensive supply chain and dedicated businesses and moderately grow in our fleet management business by targeting companies either internally managing their supply chain services or outsourcing their needs to other providers. We are also focused on maintaining strong free cash flow and returning capital to shareholders. This strategy is supported by:

•leveraging secular trends that favor outsourcing transportation and logistics services, such as increased cost and complexity, more stringent regulations, labor constraints, dynamic supply chains, and disruptive technologies; 

•offering innovative products, solutions and support services to create and strengthen customer relationships;

•delivering operational excellence through continuous productivity and process improvements;

•attracting, developing and retaining the best talent;

•deploying technology to accelerate growth while improving operational efficiencies; and

•executing our disciplined capital allocation priorities that include investing in organic growth, pursuing targeted acquisitions and investments, and returning capital to shareholders.

INDUSTRY AND OPERATIONS 

Fleet Management Solutions

Value Proposition

Through our FMS business, we provide our customers with a variety of fleet solutions that are designed to improve their competitive position. By outsourcing these services to us, our customers can focus on their core business, improve their efficiency and productivity, and lower their costs. Our FMS product offering is comprised of full service leasing as well as leasing with flexible maintenance options; shorter-term commercial vehicle rental; contract or transactional maintenance services; and digital and technology support services that optimize asset performance, compliance, safety, and comprehensive fuel services. In addition, we provide our customers the ability to purchase a large selection of used trucks, tractors and trailers through our used vehicle sales facilities or through our digital channel. FMS also provides vehicles and maintenance, fuel and other services for vehicles used in our SCS and DTS businesses.

Market Trends

The U.S. commercial fleet market is estimated to include 9 million vehicles, of which 5 million vehicles are privately owned by companies, 2 million vehicles are with for-hire carriers, 1 million vehicles are leased from banks or other financial institutions, and 1 million vehicles are being leased or rented from third parties, including Ryder1. The companies that privately own their fleets generally provide all or a portion of the fleet management services for themselves rather than outsourcing those services to third parties such as Ryder.

The Canadian commercial fleet is estimated at 500,000 vehicles, of which approximately 16,000 vehicles are being leased or rented from other third parties2. In the U.K., approximately 215,000 vehicles are being leased or rented from third parties3. 

Over the last several years, many key trends have been reshaping the transportation industry. Companies that own, maintain and manage their own fleet of vehicles have put greater emphasis on the quality of their preventive maintenance and safety programs because of increased demand for efficiency and reliability. The maintenance and operation of commercial vehicles has become more complicated and expensive, requiring companies to spend a significant amount of time and money implementing new technology, diagnostics, retooling and training. Companies must also manage global supply chain disruptions and labor issues that have accelerated due to the pandemic, such as a limited supply of commercial vehicles and a shortage of mechanics and qualified truck drivers. Maintenance and other vehicle operational processes have also become more costly as a result of increased regulation and active enforcement efforts by federal and state governments. In addition, volatility in the used vehicle sales market, fluctuating energy prices, and alternative fuel technologies have and will make it difficult for businesses to predict and manage fleet costs. We believe these trends increase the value of our product offering and will increasingly lead privately held fleets to decide to outsource.

Operations

In 2021, our global FMS business accounted for 52% of our consolidated revenue.

U.S. Our FMS customers in the U.S. range from small businesses to large national enterprises operating in a wide variety of industries, the most significant of which are transportation and warehousing, food and beverage, housing, business and personal services, and industrial. As of December 31, 2021, we had 523 operating locations, excluding ancillary storage locations, in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our operating locations serve multiple customers and have maintenance facilities that typically include a shop for preventive maintenance and repairs, a service island for fueling, safety inspections and preliminary maintenance checks, offices for sales and other personnel, and in many cases, a commercial rental vehicle counter. We also operate on-site at 155 customer locations, which primarily provide vehicle maintenance solely for that customer's fleet. 

Canada. As of December 31, 2021, we had 28 operating locations throughout seven Canadian provinces. We also operate 14 maintenance facilities on-site at customer properties in Canada. 

Europe. As of December 31, 2021, we managed a network of 341 third-party maintenance facilities and had 42 operating locations, primarily throughout the U.K., including those that we manage on behalf of our customers. We also supplied and managed vehicles and equipment for military organizations in the U.K. and Germany. As part of our strategy to

FMS Product Offerings

ChoiceLease. Our lease offering, ChoiceLease, provides customers with vehicles, maintenance services, supplies, and related equipment necessary for operation of the vehicles while our customers furnish and supervise their own drivers and exercise control over the vehicles. The ChoiceLease offering allows customers to select the terms of their lease alongside the level of maintenance they prefer, from full service coverage to on-demand, or pay-as-you-go, maintenance. 

Our ChoiceLease customers receive the following benefits:

•Competitive Prices as we are able to leverage our vehicle buying power for the benefit of our customers. Once we have signed an agreement with the customer, we acquire vehicles and components that are custom engineered to the customer’s requirements and lease the vehicles to the customer for periods generally ranging from three to seven years for trucks and tractors and typically ten years for trailers.

•Preventative and Flexible Maintenance Programs based on vehicle type and time or mileage intervals that are cost-effective and designed to reduce vehicle downtime. 

•Extensive network of maintenance facilities and trained technicians for maintenance, vehicle repairs, 24-hour emergency roadside service, and replacement vehicles for vehicles that are temporarily out of service.

•Access to Lease Vehicles as we are able to leverage our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) relationships to secure access to vehicles.

•No Vehicle Residual Risk Exposure as we typically retain vehicle residual risk exposure.

•Optional Fleet Support Services, including our fuel services; safety services such as safety training, driver certification and loss prevention consulting; vehicle use and other tax reporting, permitting and licensing, and regulatory compliance (including hours of service administration); physical damage insurance coverage under our existing insurance policies and related insurance services; environmental services; access to RyderGyde®, our mobile fleet platform that allows customers to manage all aspects of their fleet or a single vehicle; and access to RyderConnect, a full-featured GPS fleet location, tracking, and vehicle performance telematics system. In the first quarter of 2021, we completed the previously announced exit of the extension of our liability insurance coverage for ChoiceLease customers.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, ChoiceLease revenue accounted for 57% of our FMS total revenue.

Commercial Rental. We offer rental vehicles to customers that have a need to supplement their private fleet of vehicles on a short-term basis (one day up to one year in length) to handle seasonal increases in their business or discrete projects. ChoiceLease customers also utilize our commercial rental fleet to handle their peak or seasonal business needs, as substitute vehicles while their lease vehicles are undergoing maintenance, and while they are awaiting delivery of new lease vehicles. Although a portion of our commercial rental business is purely occasional in nature, we focus on building long-term relationships with customers so that we become their preferred source for commercial vehicle rentals. In addition to vehicle rental, we may extend liability insurance coverage under our existing policies to our rental customers as well as the benefits of cost savings and convenience of our comprehensive fuel services program. For the year ended December 31, 2021, commercial rental revenue accounted for 20% of our FMS total revenue. 

SelectCare. Through our SelectCare product, we provide maintenance services to customers who choose not to lease some or all of their vehicles from us. Our SelectCare customers have the opportunity to utilize our extensive network of maintenance facilities and trained technicians to maintain the vehicles they own or lease from third parties. There are several bundles of services available to SelectCare customers including full service contract maintenance, preventive only maintenance and on-demand maintenance. Vehicles covered under this offering are typically serviced at our own facilities. However, based on the size and complexity of a customer’s fleet, we may operate an on-site maintenance facility at the customer’s location or through our mobile service vehicles.

We may also offer our lease and maintenance customers additional maintenance and repair services, as needed, that are not included in contractual agreements, such as services when a customer damages a vehicle. In such situations, we generally charge the customer on an hourly basis for work performed. By servicing all of our customers’ maintenance needs, we create stronger, long-term relationships and have greater opportunity to provide customers with a wide range of outsourcing solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, SelectCare revenue accounted for 9% of our FMS total revenue.

___________________ 

(1)Commercial rental customers represent those who rented a vehicle for more than 3 days during the year and include approximately 6,100 ChoiceLease customers

(2)SelectCare customers include approximately 900 ChoiceLease customers

Fuel Services. We provide our FMS customers with access to diesel fuel at competitive prices at 434 of our maintenance facilities across the U.S. and Canada. We also provide fuel services such as fuel planning, fuel tax reporting, centralized billing, fuel cards and fuel monitoring. Although fuel sales do not have a significant impact on our FMS earnings, as it is largely a pass-through cost to customers, we believe allowing customers to leverage our fuel buying power is a significant and valuable benefit to our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, fuel services revenue accounted for 13% of our FMS total revenue.

Used Vehicles. We primarily sell our used vehicles from our 63 retail sales centers throughout North America (12 of which are co-located at an FMS shop), at our branch locations and through our website at www.ryder.com/used-trucks. Typically, before we offer used vehicles for sale, our technicians ensure that the vehicles are Ryder CertifiedTM, which means that they have passed a comprehensive, multi-point performance inspection based on specifications formulated through our maintenance program; Ryder DOT Verified™, which are fully inspected to be compliant with Department of Transportation (DOT) standards with some wear and tear, or Ryder As-Is vehicles. Given our focus on maximizing sales proceeds, we primarily sell our used vehicles through our retail channel, which allows us to leverage our maintenance expertise and strong brand reputation to realize higher sales proceeds than in the wholesale market. The realized sales proceeds of used vehicles are dependent upon various other factors, including the general state of the used vehicle market, the supply and demand for used commercial vehicles in wholesale and retail markets, and the age and condition of the vehicle at the time of its disposal. In recent years, the general state of the used vehicle sales market has been particularly volatile. Pricing in the used vehicle market significantly declined in 2019 and 2020 and then significantly increased in 2021. In 2021, OEMs faced new vehicle production challenges and rapidly changing demand patterns, resulting in strong used vehicle sales. 

FMS Business Strategy

Our FMS business strategy is to be the leading provider of fleet management outsourcing services for light, medium and heavy duty commercial highway vehicles. This strategy revolves around the following interrelated goals and priorities:

•drive fleet growth that maximizes our return on investment by (1) successfully implementing sales and marketing initiatives designed to compel private fleet operators and for-hire carriers to outsource all or some portion of their fleet management needs to us, (2) reducing costs through operational efficiencies, including long-term maintenance initiatives, and (3) offering innovative products, solutions and support services that will create and strengthen new and existing customer relationships;

•deliver a consistent, industry-leading and cost-effective lease and maintenance program to our customers through continued process improvement; productivity initiatives; and technology improvements, which also help us attract new customers; and

•optimize asset utilization and management, particularly with respect to our rental fleet, used vehicle operations and maintenance facility infrastructure.

Competition

As an alternative to using our fleet management services, companies may choose to provide these services for themselves or to obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors.

Our FMS business segment competes with companies that provide and manage maintenance services themselves and those providing similar services on a national, regional and local level. Many regional and local competitors provide services on a national level through their participation in various cooperative programs. We compete with finance lessors, truck and trailer manufacturers and independent dealers who provide full service lease products, finance leases, extended warranty maintenance, rental and other transportation services. We compete with other companies based on factors such as price, geographic coverage,

equipment, maintenance options, and service reliability and quality. We also face competition from managed maintenance providers who are hired to coordinate and manage the maintenance of large fleets of vehicles through a network of third-party maintenance providers. 

Supply Chain Solutions

Value Proposition

Through our SCS business, we offer a broad range of innovative logistics management services that are designed to optimize customers' supply chain and address customers' key business requirements. Our business is organized by industry verticals (Automotive, Technology and Healthcare, Consumer Packaged Goods and Retail, and Industrial and Other) to enable our teams to focus on the specific needs of their customers. Our SCS product offerings are organized into five categories: distribution management, dedicated transportation, transportation management, e-commerce and last mile, and professional services. These offerings are supported by a variety of information technology and engineering solutions and can be provided independently or as an integrated solution to optimize supply chain effectiveness. Key aspects of our value proposition are our operational execution and industry expertise, which are important differentiators in the marketplace.

Market Trends

Logistics spending in our key target markets in North America equates to approximately $2 trillion, of which $328 billion is outsourced4. Outsourced logistics is a market with significant growth opportunity. More sophisticated, cost-effective and reliable supply chain practices are required as supply chains expand and become more complex and susceptible to global disruptions. For example, we believe the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have accelerated trends toward supply chain resiliency, e-commerce fulfillment, final mile delivery of big and bulky goods, and onshoring and nearshoring of manufacturing and supply chain operations. The more complicated the supply chain or the product requirements, the greater the need for companies to utilize the expertise of supply chain solution providers. 

Operations

For the year ended December 31, 2021, our global SCS business accounted for 33% of our consolidated revenue.

U.S. As of December 31, 2021, we had 401 SCS customer accounts in the U.S., most of which are large enterprises that maintain large, complex supply chains. Most of our core SCS business operations are strategically geographically located to maximize efficiencies and reduce costs. At December 31, 2021, managed warehouse space totaled approximately 68 million square feet.

We also centralize certain logistics expertise in locations not associated with specific customer sites. For example, our carrier procurement, contract management, freight bill audit and payment services, and transportation optimization and execution groups operate out of our logistics centers in Novi, Michigan and Fort Worth, Texas.

Mexico. As of December 31, 2021, we had 124 SCS customer accounts and managed warehouse space totaling approximately five million square feet. Our Mexico operations offer a full range of SCS services, which are often highly integrated with our distribution and transportation operations, and manage approximately 20,600 border crossings each month between the U.S. and Mexico.

Canada. As of December 31, 2021, we had 33 SCS customer accounts and managed warehouse space totaling approximately 2.2 million square feet. The Canadian operations are highly coordinated with their U.S. and Mexico counterparts and manage approximately 9,000 border crossings each month.

SCS Product Offerings

Distribution Management. Our SCS business offers a wide range of services relating to a customer’s distribution operations, such as designing a customer’s distribution network; managing distribution facilities; coordinating warehousing and transportation for inbound and outbound material flows; handling import and export for international shipments; coordinating just-in-time replenishment of component parts to manufacturing plants and final assembly; and providing shipments to customer distribution centers or end customer delivery points, including support for e-commerce fulfillment networks. Additional value-added services, such as light assembly of components into defined units, packaging and refurbishment, are also offered to our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2021, distribution management solutions accounted for 40% of our SCS revenue.

Dedicated Transportation. Dedicated transportation services are offered as part of an integrated supply chain solution to our customers with a high degree of specialization with a combination of outside carriers, equipment, drivers and dedicated services. Our dedicated transportation services offering is designed to increase our customers' competitive position, improve risk management and integrate their transportation needs with their overall supply chain. As part of our dedicated transportation services, we also offer routing and scheduling, fleet sizing, safety, regulatory compliance, risk management, technology and communication systems support including on-board computer and other technical support. These additional services allow our customers to mitigate labor challenges associated with maintaining a private fleet of vehicles, such as driver recruitment and turnover, and government regulation, including hours of service regulations, DOT audits and workers' compensation. Dedicated transportation operations are located at our customer facilities, and our dedicated offering utilizes and benefits from our extensive network of FMS facilities, which provides maintenance for all Ryder vehicles used in SCS solutions. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of our SCS revenue was related to dedicated transportation services.

Transportation Management. Our SCS business offers freight transportation, transportation management, and brokerage services relating to all aspects of a customer’s transportation network, including shipment optimization, load scheduling, and delivery confirmation through a series of technological and web-based solutions. Our transportation consultants focus on carrier procurement of all modes of transportation with an emphasis on truck-based transportation, and also includes rate negotiation, freight bill audits and payment services. In addition, our SCS business provides customers with brokerage services designed to provide prequalified trucking capacity in North America. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased or executed approximately $7.4 billion in freight moves on our customers' behalf, including $246 million in brokerage services. For the year ended December 31, 2021, transportation management solutions accounted for 10% of our SCS revenue.

E-commerce and Last Mile. Our e-commerce and last mile services offer omnichannel delivery with two-day delivery across the entire U.S. and one-day delivery across the majority of the U.S. Our e-commerce and last mile services are provided through a network of over 100 sites strategically located throughout the U.S. For our e-commerce customers, we receive, pick, pack, and ship smaller items via parcel carriers to the end consumer’s home or through our carrier networks to our customer’s warehouse or retail stores. For our last mile customers, we receive, assemble, and prepare big and bulky items through a third-party agent network for final delivery to the end consumer. Consumers can then choose from multiple levels of delivery services, including minor installation of the item and disposal of the replaced item. We use proprietary scheduling software for maximum efficiency that optimizes routes and allows customers to select their appointment time. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our e-commerce and last mile services accounted for 10% of our SCS revenue.

Professional Services. Our SCS business offers a variety of knowledge-based professional services that support every aspect of a customer’s supply chain. Our SCS professionals evaluate a customer’s existing supply chain to identify inefficiencies as well as opportunities for integration and improvement. Once the assessment is complete, we work with the customer to develop a supply chain strategy to create the most value for the customer and their target clients. The solution may include both a network design that sets forth the number, location and function of key components of the network and a transportation solution that optimizes the mode or modes of transportation and route selection. For the year ended December 31, 2021, knowledge-based professional services accounted for 7% of our SCS revenue.

Strategic Investments

On November 1, 2021, we acquired Midwest Warehouse and Distribution (Midwest), a warehousing, distribution, and transportation company based in Woodbridge, IL. The acquisition is expected to expand our supply chain services, including multi-customer warehousing and distribution. Midwest was incorporated into our distribution management and dedicated transportation product offerings. On January 1, 2022, we acquired PLG Investments I, LLC (Whiplash), a leading national provider of omnichannel fulfillment and logistics services. The acquisition is expected to expand our e-commerce and omnichannel fulfillment network.

SCS Business Strategy

Our SCS business strategy is to offer our customers differentiated, functional execution and proactive solutions from our expertise in key industry verticals. The strategy revolves around the following interrelated goals and priorities:

•provide customers with best in class execution and quality through reliable and flexible supply chain solutions;

•develop innovative solutions and capabilities that drive value for our customers, such as RyderShareTM, a real-time collaborative visibility tool showing all goods moving across the supply chain;

•create a culture of innovation and collaboration to provide solutions to meet our clients' needs;

•focus consistently on network optimization and continuous improvement;

•execute on targeted sales and marketing growth strategies; and

•expand customer relationships to include fast growing offerings in e-commerce fulfillment and last mile.

Competition

As an alternative to using our services, companies may choose to internally manage their own supply chains and logistics operations, or obtain similar or alternative services from other third-party vendors.

In the SCS business segment, we compete with a large number of companies providing similar services, each of which has a different set of core competencies. We compete with a handful of large, multi-service companies across all of our product offerings and industries. We also compete against other companies on specific service offerings (for example, in transportation management, distribution management or dedicated transportation) or with companies specializing in a specific industry. We face different competitors in each country or region where they may have a greater operational presence. We compete based on factors such as price, service offerings, market knowledge, expertise in logistics-related technology and overall performance (e.g., timeliness, accuracy, and flexibility).

Dedicated Transportation Solutions

Value Proposition

Through our DTS business, we combine equipment, maintenance, drivers, administrative services and additional services, including routing and scheduling, fleet sizing, safety, regulatory compliance, risk management, and technology and communication systems support to provide customers with a dedicated transportation solution that is designed to increase their competitive position, improve risk management and integrate their transportation needs with their overall supply chain. This solution allows us to mitigate our customers' labor challenges associated with maintaining a private fleet of vehicles, such as driver recruitment and retention, and government regulation, including electronic logging devices and hours of service regulations, DOT audits and workers’ compensation. Our DTS solution offers a high degree of specialization to meet the needs of customers with sophisticated service requirements such as tight delivery windows, high-value or time-sensitive freight distribution, closed-loop distribution, multi-stop shipments, specialized equipment and integrated transportation needs.

Market Trends

The U.S. dedicated market is estimated to be $20 billion5 from an addressable market of approximately $400 billion6. This market is affected by many of the same trends that impact our FMS business. The administrative requirements relating to regulations issued by the DOT regarding driver screening, training and testing, as well as record keeping and other costs associated with the hours of service requirements, make our DTS offering an attractive alternative to private fleet and driver management. There continues to be significant pressure on the availability of qualified truck drivers and shippers continue to seek dedicated capacity from quality transportation and logistics providers, which makes our offering attractive to potential customers. In addition, market demand for just-in-time delivery creates a need for well-defined routing and scheduling plans that are based on comprehensive asset utilization analysis and fleet rationalization studies offered as part of our DTS services.

Operations/Product Offerings

For the year ended December 31, 2021, our DTS business accounted for 15% of our consolidated revenue. As of December 31, 2021, we had 205 DTS customer accounts in the U.S. Because it is highly customized, our DTS product is particularly attractive to companies that operate in industries that have time-sensitive deliveries or special handling requirements, as well as companies who require specialized equipment. DTS accounts typically operate in a limited geographic area, and, therefore, most of the drivers assigned to these accounts are short haul drivers, meaning they return home at the end of each work day, which helps with driver recruiting and retention. Although a significant portion of our DTS operations are located at customer facilities, our DTS business also utilizes and benefits from our extensive network of FMS facilities, including the FMS maintenance network that services the vehicles used in DTS solutions.

In order to customize a DTS transportation solution for our customers, our DTS logistics specialists perform a transportation analysis using advanced logistics planning and operating tools. Based on this analysis, they formulate a logistics design that includes the routing and scheduling of vehicles, the efficient use of vehicle capacity and overall asset utilization. The goal of each customized plan is to create a distribution system that optimizes freight flow while meeting a customer’s service goals. A team of DTS transportation specialists can then implement the plan by leveraging the resources, expertise and technological capabilities of both our FMS and SCS businesses.

To the extent a distribution plan includes multiple modes of transportation (air, rail, sea and highway), our DTS team, in conjunction with our SCS transportation specialists, selects appropriate transportation modes and carriers, places the freight, monitors carrier performance and audits billing. In addition, through our SCS business, we can reduce costs and add value to a DTS customer’s distribution system by aggregating orders into loads, looking for shipment consolidation opportunities and organizing loads for vehicles that are returning from their destination point back to their point of origin (backhaul).

DTS Business Strategy

Our DTS business strategy is to offer services to customers who need specialized equipment, specialized handling, dedicated capacity, or integrated transportation services. This strategy revolves around the following interrelated goals and priorities:

•increase market share to provide more specialized services with customers across industries, including customers in the retail, metals and mining, energy and utility, consumer product goods, construction, and food and beverage industries;

•develop innovative solutions and capabilities that drive value for our customers, such as RyderShareTM, a real-time collaborative visibility tool showing all goods moving across the supply chain;

•utilize the support of the FMS sales team to compel private fleet operators to outsource all or some of their transportation needs to us;

•align the DTS business with other SCS product lines to create revenue opportunities and improve operating efficiencies in both segments; 

•improve competitiveness in the non-specialized and non-integrated customer segments, including dedicated capacity solutions; and

•recruit and retain drivers.

Competition

Our DTS business segment competes with other dedicated providers and truckload carriers servicing on a national, regional and local level. We compete with these companies based on a number of factors, including price, equipment options and features, maintenance, service and geographic coverage, driver availability and operations expertise. We are able to differentiate our DTS product offering by leveraging our FMS vehicles and maintenance services and integrating the DTS services with those of SCS to create a more comprehensive transportation solution for our customers. Our strong safety record and focus on customer service also enables us to uniquely meet the needs of customers with high-value products that require specialized handling in a manner that differentiates us from truckload carriers.

COVID-19

Our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For a detailed discussion of its impact on our results of operations and future considerations, refer to our "Consolidated Results" and "Operating Results by Business Segment" discussions in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, for a detailed description of certain risk factors that impact our business, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to “Item 1A-Risk Factors” and "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" sections included in this Annual Report.

CYCLICALITY 

Our business is impacted by economic and market conditions. In a strong economic cycle, there is generally more demand for our fleet management, dedicated transportation and supply chain services. In a weak or volatile economy, demand for our services decreases and is considerably more unpredictable. Because of these factors, we have continued to focus on increasing the diversity of our customer base and strengthening our long-term business relationships with our customers. Although we believe these efforts help mitigate the immediate impact of an economic downturn, customers are often unwilling to commit to a full-service lease or long-term supply chain and dedicated contracts during a protracted or severe economic downturn. Because commercial rental and used vehicle sales are transactional, they are more cyclical in nature and are also heavily dependent on economic and market conditions, and results can vary significantly in both the short- and long-term. We mitigate some of the potential impact of an economic downturn through a disciplined and centralized approach to asset management. This approach allows us to manage the size, mix and location of our operating fleet and used vehicle inventories to try and maximize asset utilization and used vehicle proceeds in both strong and weak market conditions. 

REGULATION

Our business is subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities. The DOT and various federal and state agencies exercise broad powers over certain aspects of our business, generally governing such activities as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, safety and operations. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), under the DOT, manages a Compliance, Safety, Accountability initiative (CSA), partnering with state agencies designed to monitor and improve commercial vehicle motor safety, which uses roadside inspections and violations to measure motor carriers and drivers. The FMCSA also has regulations mandating electronic logging devices in commercial motor vehicles that impact various aspects of our dedicated, supply chain and rental businesses.

We are also subject to a variety of laws and regulations promulgated by national, state, provincial and local governments, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which regulate safety, the management of hazardous materials, water discharges, air emissions, solid waste disposal and the release and cleanup of regulated substances. In addition, we must comply with licensing and other requirements imposed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Customs Service as a result of increased focus on homeland security and our Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism certification. We may also become subject to new or more restrictive regulations imposed by these agencies or other authorities or states relating to carbon controls and reporting, engine exhaust emissions, drivers’ hours of service, wage and hour requirements, security, including data privacy and cyber security, and ergonomics. We are also subject to a variety of state and local regulations related to pandemic response, including health and wellness and sanitation responses in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has, and will, require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations.

Additional information about the regulations that we are subject to can be found in Item 1A. "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Refer to Note 20, “Environmental Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. 

HUMAN CAPITAL 

We strive to create a high-performance culture that embraces diverse perspectives and experiences and ensures that all of our employees have opportunities to develop the skills they need to grow and excel in their fields. Human capital management is a priority for our executives and Board of Directors. We are committed to identifying and developing the talent necessary for our long-term success throughout all levels of our organization, including our front-line employees interacting with our customers or behind-the scenes supporting our field teams. We have a robust talent and succession planning process and have established programs to support the development of our talent pipeline for critical roles in our organization. Annually, we conduct a robust review with the leadership team focusing on high performing and high potential talent, diverse talent and the succession plan for our critical roles. 

9

We also recognize that it is important to develop our future leaders. We provide a variety of resources to help our employees build and develop their skills, including online development resources as well as individual development opportunities and projects for key talent. Additionally, we have leadership development resources for our future leaders as they continue to develop their skills. We invest in our employees by offering comprehensive health, welfare and retirement programs, along with wellness programs and well-being initiatives.

In addition, we provide our drivers, technicians and warehouse workers with on-going training opportunities. For example, we pair our drivers with certified driver trainers during onboarding and provide position- and customer-specific training. Our technicians also receive both online and in-person training to enable them to continuously improve their maintenance skills and we collaborate with our OEMs to ensure our technicians possess the knowledge and skills necessary to service our customers. Our warehouse workers also receive regular safety and compliance training that is specific to their location.  

At December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42,800 full-time employees worldwide, of which 41,900 were employed in North America and 900 in Europe. We currently employ approximately 10,200 drivers and 4,900 technicians. We have approximately 27,400 hourly employees in the U.S., approximately 3,200 of which are organized by labor unions. Those employees organized by labor unions are principally represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, and the United Auto Workers. Their wages and benefits are governed by 96 separate labor agreements which are renegotiated periodically. Although we have not experienced a material work stoppage or strike, these events can potentially occur given the types of businesses in which we currently engage. We consider the relationship with our employees to be good. Refer to Item 1A.

Safety

Our safety culture is founded upon a core commitment to the safety, health and well-being of our employees, customers and the community. As a core value, our focus on safety is embedded in our day-to-day operations, reinforced by many safety programs and continuous operational improvement and supported by a talented and dedicated safety organization. We have created and implemented policies, processes and training programs to minimize safety events, and we review and monitor our performance closely. Our Safety Organization team oversees our overall safety strategy and consists of three divisions: Safety Standards & Technology, Field Safety Solutions, U.S. Department of Transportation Compliance. Together, our Safety Organization manages our safety policies, technologies and training, all field safety processes, risks assessments, safety site investigations and regulatory compliance activities, among other things. 

We deploy relevant vehicle safety systems in the vehicles we operate, including active brake assistance, lane departure warning systems and stability control, to enhance safety performance. We also install aftermarket safety monitoring systems that provide effective means for our operations teams to measure and improve driver performance, including in-vehicle video event recorders. Driver training is also a key component of our safety program. We use certified driver trainers to on-board and train our drivers. Proactive injury and crash prevention and remedial training are also delivered regularly online to each employee through a highly interactive lesson platform. Regular safety behavioral observations are conducted by managers throughout the organization every day and remedial training and coaching takes place on the spot. Our technicians also receive both online and in-person training to enable them to continuously improve their maintenance skills to ensure we are servicing our customers in compliance with best-in-line safety measures. Our proprietary, web-based safety management system, Ryder SafetyNet, delivers monthly proactive safety programs as well as safety compliance tasks tailored to every location and helps measure safety activity effectiveness across the organization. Our safety policies require that all managers, supervisors and employees incorporate safe processes in all aspects of our business. Monthly safety scorecards are tracked and reviewed by management for progress toward key safety objectives. 

COVID-19 and Employee Safety and Wellness

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the safety and well-being of our employees and their families has been a top priority, consistent with our company's core values, as we continue to serve our customers. Our operations supporting the supply chains and transportation needs of our customers has been deemed essential and we have continued operations during this period, but with diligent emphasis around following the guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and applicable state and local governments. We have adopted and implemented the COVID-19 Exposure Prevention, Preparedness, and Response Plan (COVID Response Plan), which defines our policies and procedures designed to mitigate the potential for transmission of COVID-19 and prevent exposure to illness from certain other infectious diseases. Among other things, the COVID Response Plan details employee and company responsibilities related to house-keeping and sanitization, hygiene and respiratory etiquette, use of personal protective equipment, employee and visitor screening procedures, leave policies and accommodations, remote working opportunities and infrastructure, and protocols for not reporting to work and when to return to work upon potential or

confirmed COVID-19 exposure or infection. Company leadership and each business has increased the frequency of cross-functional communications to quickly identify and address any pandemic related needs. In addition, we use technology resources and human capital to develop tracking tools with predictive capabilities in an effort to further protect the workforce and efficiently deploy resources to do so. Further, we refined our wellness programs and communications aimed at informing employees about the pandemic, as well as engaging employees with healthcare providers to promote the proactive evaluation, tracking, and management of major health and wellness indicators.
