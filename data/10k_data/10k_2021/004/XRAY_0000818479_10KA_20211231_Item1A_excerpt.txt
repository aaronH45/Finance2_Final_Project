PART I 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 

Summary 

The following is a summary of the significant risk factors that could materially impact the Company’s business, financial condition or future results, including risks related to COVID-19, risks related to our businesses, risks related to our international operations, risks related to our regulatory environments, risks related to ownership of our common stock, and general risks: 

•The Company’s revenue, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. 

•Management identified material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that resulted in errors in financial statements. If the Company fails to remediate these material weaknesses or experiences additional material weaknesses in the future, it may be unable to accurately and timely report financial results or comply with the requirements of being a public company, which could cause the price of the Company’s common stock to decline and harm its business. 

•We reached a determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues. 

•The Company may be subject to litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or orders as a result of or relating to our internal investigation and our failure to timely file our Quarterly Reports with the SEC and if any of these items are resolved adversely against us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

•We were not timely in filing our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and, as a result, are not in compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with Nasdaq’s listing standards and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

•Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, and restricts our ability to issue equity securities. 

•Lack of global standardized processes and/or centralization of transaction management and/or execution could result in control deficiencies and impact management’s assertions and financial reporting. 

•The Company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors, which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies. 

• The Company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its businesses, and any cyber incidents with respect to its information and technology infrastructure, whether by deliberate attacks or unintentional events, could harm theCompany’s operations. 

•Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cross-border data transfer restrictions and other regulations may adversely affect our business. 

•The success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisitions and dispositions, and strategic investments. 

•The Company may be unable to develop innovative products or stimulate customer demand. 

•The Company’s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time, resulting in material operating costs and financial losses. 

•The Company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives, including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts. 

•The Company has recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges, most recently in 2020, and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future. 

•The Company’s failure to obtain issued patents and, consequently, to protect the Company’s proprietary technology could hurt the Company’s competitive position. 

•The Company’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon the Company’s intellectual property rights or if the Company’s products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. 

•Changes in the Company’s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options. 

•The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under the Company’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. 

•The Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of loan covenants. 

•The Company’s hedging and cash management transactions may expose the Company to loss or limit the Company’s potential gains. 

•Certain of the Company’s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending. 

•Due to the Company’s international operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. 

7   

•Due to the international nature of our business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the U.S. and Europe, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance. 

•Changes in or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, transfer pricing regulations, country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates. 

•The Company may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances. 

•Inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for procedures using the Company’s products may cause the Company’s revenue to decline. 

•Challenges may be asserted against the Company’s products due to real or perceived quality, health or environmental issues. 

•If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to the Company’s operations, which could adversely affect the Company’s business. 

•The Company’s business is subject to extensive, complex and changing domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, directives, circulars and orders that failure to comply with which, if not complied with, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities. 

•The Company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the Company’s common stock may continue to be volatile. 

•Certain provisions in the Company’s governing documents, and of Delaware law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the Company. 

• The loss of members of our senior management and the resulting management transition might harm our future operating results. 

•Talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the Company’s ability to grow the business. 

•The Company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims. 

•Climate change and related natural disasters could negatively impact the Company’s business and financial results. 

Below is a full description of each of such significant risk factors. The risk factors included are identical to those included in the Form 10-Q/A the Company is filing concurrently with this 10-K/A and are as of the date of the amended filings. 

RISKS RELATED TO COVID-19 

The Company’s revenue, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. 

The Company continues to closely monitor the global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the recent resurgence of infections and associated COVID-19 variants, which may have a significant negative effect on, revenue, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity. Governmental authorities and private enterprises globally are continuing to implement actions to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, including restrictions on public gatherings, travel and commercial operations, temporary closures or decreased operations of dental offices, as well as certain government mandates to limit certain dental procedures to those that could be considered emergency only. These measures and the impact of COVID-19 generally, may result in, or continue to result in: 

•supply chain disruptions for products we sell, including the inability to obtain raw materials, the inflated price of inputs, disruptions of the operations of our logistics, service providers and the resulting delays in shipments; 

•continuing or new partial or country-wide business lockdowns in various markets; 

•temporary closures or significantly reduced operations at most of the Company’s principal manufacturing and distribution locations, including furloughing employees related to these locations, which could reduce the Company’s ability to manufacture and deliver products to customers;  

•global reductions in customer demand for certain of the Company’s products and services;  

•a shift in service delivery options and customer expectations in regard to service delivery options; 

•decreased financial viability of the Company’s suppliers, which could cause them to change the terms on which they are willing to provide products;  

•the inability or failure of customers to timely meet payment obligations or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties, which may have a negative material impact on the Company’s cash flow, liquidity and statements of operations;  

•fear of exposure to or actual effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries where operations or customers are located and may lead to decreased procedures at dental offices. The impacts include, but are not limited to, significant reductions or volatility in demand and increased pricing pressures for one or more of the Company’s products;  

•a recession or prolonged period of economic slowdown, which may significantly reduce the Company’s cash flow and negatively impact the cost and access to capital and funding sources for the Company;  

•the Company’s inability to maintain compliance with covenants under the revolving credit facilities; or  

8   

•the reduced availability of key employees or members of management due to quarantine or illness as a result of COVID-19 may temporarily affect the financial performance and results of operations. If the Company is unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, its business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

The Company does not yet know the full extent of the ultimate impact of the continued COVID-19 pandemic on its business, operations, or the global economy. Given the dynamic nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, it is very difficult to predict the severity of the impact on the Company’s business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with certainty, including new information which may emerge concerning the spread and severity of outbreak, including COVID-19 variants, and actions taken to address the impacts, among others. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19. To the extent that the COVID-19 outbreak continues to adversely affect the business and financial performance, it also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR RESTATEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROLS 

Management identified material weaknesses in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that resulted in errors in financial statements. If the Company fails to remediate these material weaknesses or experiences additional material weaknesses in the future, it may be unable to accurately and timely report financial results or comply with the requirements of being a public company, which could cause the price of the Company’s common stock to decline and harm its business. 

Management identified material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting in conjunction with the Audit and Finance Committee’s investigation described in the Explanatory Note of this Form 10-K/A. The description of the material weaknesses that were determined to exist as of December 31, 2021 is included under Item 8 of this Form 10-K/A. 

A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected in a timely basis. 

While we are taking steps to address the identified material weaknesses and prevent additional material weaknesses from occurring, it cannot be assured that the measures the Company has taken to date, and is continuing to implement, will be sufficient to remediate these material weaknesses or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. Accordingly, there could continue to be a reasonable possibility that the material weaknesses identified, or other material weaknesses or deficiencies identified in the future, could result in a misstatement of accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of the Company’s financial statements that would not be prevented or detected on a timely basis or cause us to fail to meet our obligations under securities laws, stock exchange listing rules, or debt instrument covenants to file periodic financial reports on a timely basis. Any of these failures could result in adverse consequences that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, including an adverse impact on the market price of its common stock, potential action by the SEC, shareholder lawsuits, delisting of the Company’s stock, and general damage to its reputation. The Company has incurred and expects to incur additional costs to rectify the material weaknesses or new issues that may emerge, and the existence of these issues could adversely affect its reputation or investor perceptions. The Company maintains director and officer liability insurance, for which it must pay substantial premiums. The additional reporting and other obligations resulting from these material weaknesses, including any litigation or regulatory inquires that may result therefrom, increase legal and financial compliance costs and the costs of related legal, accounting and administrative activities. 

9   

We reached a determination to restate certain of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, which resulted in unanticipated costs and may affect investor confidence and raise reputational issues. 

As discussed in the Explanatory Note, in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies and Restatement in this Form 10-K/A, we also reached a determination to restate our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and for the year ended December 31, 2021 following the identification of certain misstatements contained in those financial statements, which resulted in an overstatement of Net sales for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 by approximately $20 million. We have determined that it is appropriate to correct the misstatements in our previously issued financial statements by amending and restating the Original Filing. The restatement also included corrections for additional identified out-of-period and uncorrected misstatements in the impacted periods. As a result, we have incurred unanticipated costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement, and have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties, which may affect investor confidence in the accuracy of our financial disclosures and may raise reputational issues for our business. 

The Company may be subject to litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or orders as a result of or relating to our internal investigation and our failure to timely file our Quarterly Reports with the SEC and if any of these items are resolved adversely against us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

 As previously disclosed, we voluntarily contacted the SEC to advise that the Audit and Finance Committee was conducting an independent investigation regarding certain financial reporting matters, and we are continuing to cooperate with the SEC. The SEC’s investigation is ongoing and was not resolved when the Audit and Finance Committee completed the internal investigation or when the 2021 Form 10-K/A was filed. We intend to fully cooperate with the SEC regarding this matter. Additionally, several securities class action lawsuits were filed against us following our announcement on May 10, 2022 of the Audit and Finance Committee’s internal investigation. Our failure to timely file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC, as well as our reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, may subject us to additional litigation and regulatory examinations, investigations, proceedings or orders, including additional cease and desist orders, the suspension of trading of our securities, delisting of our securities, the assessment of civil monetary penalties, and other equitable remedies. Our management has devoted and may be required to devote significant time and attention to these matters. If any of these matters are resolved adversely against us, it could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, while we cannot estimate our potential exposure to these matters at this time, we have already expended a significant amount of time and resources investigating the claims underlying and defending these matters and expect to continue to need to expend our resources to conclude these matters. For further information, see Note 22, Commitments and Contingencies, discussing the securities class action lawsuits, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K/A.  

We were not timely in filing our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q with the SEC for the periods ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, and, as a result, are not in compliance with the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. We cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to comply with Nasdaq’s listing standards and the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected if we are delisted from the Nasdaq Stock Market. 

On May 12, 2022, the Company received notice from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”) that, because the Company had not yet filed its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2022 (the “First Quarter 10-Q”) with the SEC, the Company was no longer in compliance with the continued listing requirements under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires Nasdaq-listed companies to timely file all periodic reports with the SEC. 

As previously disclosed by the Company and further discussed in this Form 10-K/A, the Company had been unable to file the First Quarter 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2022 because the Company’s Audit and Finance Committee, together with independent outside counsel, was conducting an investigation concerning the Company’s use of incentives to sell products to distributors in the third and fourth quarters of 2021, whether those incentives were appropriately accounted for and whether the impact of those sales was adequately disclosed in the Company’s periodic reports filed with the SEC. This investigation remained ongoing during the period ended June 30, 2022, and resulted in the Company being unable to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2022 (the “Second Quarter 10-Q”). 

On August 12, 2022, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq regarding its continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). In response, on August 13, 2022, the Company submitted an updated plan for compliance with a request to Nasdaq for additional time to demonstrate compliance with the listing rules. Nasdaq has granted the Company an extension of time until November 7, 2022 to regain compliance with the listing rules by filing the First Quarter 10-Q and the Second Quarter 10-Q with the SEC by the extension date. 

10   

There is no assurance, however, that we will regain compliance during the extension grace period or be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing requirements in the future. If we are not able to regain compliance during the extension grace period, Nasdaq will notify us that our common stock will be suspended and subject to delisting. If we are subject to delisting, we may appeal Nasdaq’s determination to delist to a hearings panel. During any appeal process, shares of our common stock would continue to trade on Nasdaq. 

If our common stock were delisted from Nasdaq, we and our shareholders could face significant material adverse consequences, including those involving: 

•the liquidity of our common stock; 

•the market price of our common stock; 

•changes in our credit ratings; 

•our ability to raise additional capital; 

• our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations;

• our ability to maintain compliance with covenants in our existing debt instruments, including a breach of the covenants under our debt instruments outstanding that could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement;  

•the number of institutional and general investors that will consider investing in our common stock; 

•the number of market makers in our common stock; 

•the availability of information concerning the trading prices and volume of our common stock; and 

•the number of broker-dealers willing to execute trades in shares of our common stock. 

Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital and restricts our ability to issue equity securities. 

We did not timely file our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 within each respective timeframe required by the SEC, meaning we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC. This limits our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we might otherwise believe are beneficial to our business. We are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that allows us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use “shelf” registration statements to conduct offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regain and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue a public offering now, we would be required to file a registration statement on Form S-1 and have it reviewed and declared effective by the SEC. Doing so would take significantly longer than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and the necessity of using a Form S-1 for a public offering of registered securities could, to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods, adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner. 

Lack of global standardized processes and/or centralization of transaction management and/or execution have resulted and could continue to result in control deficiencies and could impact management’s assertions and financial reporting. 

The Company’s implementation of its business plans, restructuring plans and compliance with regulations requires that the Company effectively manage its financial infrastructure, including standardizing processes, maintaining proper financial reporting and internal controls. The Company continues to focus on standardizing its processes, improving its financial systems, maintaining effective internal controls and centralizing transaction management and/or execution so as to provide continued assurance with respect to the Company’s financial reports, support the continued growth of the business, and prevent financial misstatement or fraud. Non-standardized processes and ineffective controls could result in an inability to aggregate and analyze data in a timely and accurate manner and may lead to inaccurate or incomplete financial and management reporting and delays in financial reporting to management, regulators and/or shareholders. Inaccurate or incomplete financial reporting and disclosures could also result in noncompliance with applicable business and regulatory requirements and the incurring of related penalties. 

11   

Additionally, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or omissions because of certain limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. As a result, even effective internal controls may not provide reasonable assurances with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become either obsolete or inadequate as a result of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. If the Company fails to maintain adequate internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if the Company experiences difficulties in implementing new or revised controls, the Company’s business and operating results could be harmed and the Company could fail to meet the Company’s reporting obligations. 

Further, the Company currently has disparate systems, including enterprise resource planning systems, across the organization which may result in the potential inability to obtain and analyze business data and increases in budgets due to higher costs stemming from system upgrades, and may pose business partner connection challenges. As a result, the data required to manage the business may not be complete, accurate or consistent, resulting in the potential for misleading or inaccurate reporting for key business decisions.  

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESSES 

The Company may be unable to execute key strategic activities due to competing priorities and strategies of its distribution partners and other factors, which may result in financial loss and operational inefficiencies. 

As part of the restructuring plan adopted in November 2018, the Company announced that it intends to grow revenues, expand margins and simplify the business. The Company continues to generate a substantial portion of its revenue through a limited number of distributors which provide important sales, distribution and service support to the end-user customers. Together, the Company’s two largest distributors, Patterson and Henry Schein, accounted for approximately 13% of the Company’s annual revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, and it is anticipated that they will continue to be the largest distribution contributors to the Company’s revenue through 2022. The Company may be unable to execute its key strategic activities and investments due to the competing priorities of its distribution partners which may introduce competing private label, generic, or low-cost products that compete with the Company’s products at lower price points, particularly in the Technologies & Equipment segment products that are sold and serviced through distributor channels. If these competing products capture significant market share or result in a decrease in market prices overall, this could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. 

Additionally, some parts of the dental market continue to be impacted by price competition that is driven in part by the consolidation of dental practices, innovation and product advancements, and the price sensitivity of end-user customers. There can be no assurance that the Company’s distribution partners will purchase any specified minimum quantity of products from the Company or that they will continue to purchase any products at all. If Patterson or Henry Schein ceases to purchase a significant volume of products from the Company, or if changes in the Company’s promotional strategies and investments result in changes in the Company’s distributor relationships or short-term uneven growth, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. 

The Company relies in part on its dealer and customer relationships and predictions of dealer and customer inventory levels in projecting future demand levels and financial results. These inventory levels may fluctuate, and may differ from the Company’s predictions, resulting in the Company’s projections of future results being different than expected. These changes may be influenced by changing relationships with the dealers and customers, economic conditions and customer preference for particular products. There can be no assurance that the Company’s dealers and customers will maintain levels of inventory in accordance with the Company’s predictions or past history, or that the timing of customers’ inventory build-up or liquidation will be in accordance with the Company’s predictions or past history. Additionally, the Company periodically upgrades or replaces its various software systems, including its customer relationship management systems. If the Company encounters unforeseen problems with new systems or in migrating away from our existing applications and systems, our operations and our ability to manage our business could be negatively impacted. 

The Company relies heavily on information and technology to operate its businesses, and any cyber incidents with respect to its information and technology infrastructure, whether by deliberate attacks or unintentional events, could harm the Company’s operations. 

 The Company is exposed to the risk of cyber incidents, which can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events, in the normal course of business. The Company uses web-enabled and other integrated information and technology systems in delivering its services and expects that the breadth and complexity of the Company’s information and technology systems will increase as the Company expands its products offerings to utilize artificial intelligence and analytics. As a result, the Company will increasingly be exposed to risks inherent in the development, integration and operation of its evolving information and technology infrastructure, including: 

12   

• security breaches, viruses, cyberattacks, ransomware or other malware or other failures or malfunctions; 

• disruption, impairment or failure of data centers, telecommunications facilities or other infrastructure platforms 

• failures during the process of upgrading or replacing software, databases or components contained in the information and technology infrastructure; 

• the compromise or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or proprietary information related to the Company’s business and customers; 

• excessive costs, excessive delays or other deficiencies in systems development and deployment; 

• an unintentional event that involves a third-party gaining unauthorized access to the Company’s systems or proprietary information; and 

• power outages, damage or interruption from fires or other natural disasters, hardware failures. 

Any disruptions to or impairment in the Company’s or its service providers’ information and technology infrastructures could pose a threat to the Company’s operations and harm its business. 

 The Company continues to observe an increased levels of cyber threats focused on gaining unauthorized access to its information and technology infrastructure for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. Although the Company takes measures designed to protect such information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure, the Company’s and its service providers’ infrastructures and storage applications may be impaired due to unauthorized access by hackers, ransomware, phishing attacks, human error, malfeasance, natural disasters, telecommunications and electrical failures and other disruptions. For example, the Company may be the victim of cyber-attacks, targeted at the theft of financial assets, intellectual property, employee information, personal information of individuals and customers, or other sensitive information. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Like other large, global companies, the Company has experienced and expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time. The Company cannot provide assurances that, despite the Company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of the Company’s systems and the measures that the Company or its service providers take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats, a future cyber-attack would not result in material harm to the Company or its business and results of operations. For example, certain techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and the Company may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. These data breaches and any unauthorized access or disclosure of the Company’s information could compromise intellectual property and expose sensitive business information. The Company’s policies, employee training (including phishing prevention training), procedures and technical safeguards may be insufficient to prevent or detect improper access to confidential, proprietary or sensitive data, including personal data. Cyber attacks could also cause the Company to incur significant remediation costs, disrupt key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. 

 The Company also faces the ongoing challenge of managing access controls to its information and technology infrastructure. The Company has experienced various types of cyber incidents in the past and as the result of such incidents, the Company has implemented new controls, governance, technical protections and other procedures. If the Company does not successfully manage these access controls it could expose the Company to risk of security breaches or disruptions. Any such security breaches or disruptions could compromise the security or integrity of the Company’s networks or result in the loss, misappropriation, and/or unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive data or confidential information (including trade secrets or other intellectual property, proprietary business information, and personal information). If the Company’s information systems are breached, sensitive and proprietary data is compromised, surreptitiously modified, rendered inaccessible for any period of time or made public, or if the Company fails to make adequate or timely disclosures to affected individuals, appropriate state and federal regulatory authorities or law enforcement agencies, it could result in significant fines, penalties, orders, sanctions and proceedings or actions against the Company by governmental or other regulatory authorities, customers or third parties. The Company may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences such as liability, reputational harm and significant remediation costs and experience material harm to the Company’s business and financial results if the Company experiences cyber incidents in the future. 

The materialization of any of these risks may impede the utilization of Company product offerings, the processing of data and the day-to-day management of the Company’s business and could result in the corruption, loss or unauthorized disclosure of proprietary, confidential or other data. Disaster recovery plans, where in place, might not adequately protect the Company in the event of a system failure. Further, the Company currently does not have excess or standby computer processing or network capacity everywhere in the world to avoid disruption in the receipt, processing and delivery of data in the event of a system failure. Despite any precautions the Company take, damage from fire, floods, hurricanes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, break-ins, human error and similar events at the Company’s various computer facilities could result in interruptions in the flow of data to the Company’s servers. 

The legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide continues to evolve. The Company collects personally identifiable information (“PII”) and other data as part of the Company’s business processes and activities. This data is subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. Many foreign countries and governmental bodies have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of PII and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions. The European Union General Data Protection Regulation, for example, imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides significant penalties for noncompliance. Any inability, or perceived inability, to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations, or other legal obligations (including at newly acquired companies) could result in additional cost and liability to the Company or Company officials, damage its reputation, inhibit sales, and otherwise adversely affect its business.  

Any of the foregoing incidents could also subject the Company to liability, expose the Company to significant expense, or cause significant harm to the Company’s reputation, all of which could result in lost revenues. While the Company has invested and continues to invest in information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans, these measures cannot fully insulate the Company from cyber incidents, technology disruptions or data loss and the resulting adverse effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. 

Privacy concerns and laws, evolving regulation of cross-border data transfer restrictions and other regulations may adversely affect our business. 

Global regulation related to the provision of services on the Internet is increasing, as federal, state and foreign governments continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage and use of personal information. Such laws and regulations are subject to new and differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for the Company’s services or restrict the Company’s ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer future digital dentistry services in certain locations or our ability to deploy our solutions globally. The costs of compliance with and other burdens imposed by these types of laws, regulations and standards may limit the use and adoption of our services, reduce overall demand for our services, lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance, any of which could harm our business. 

13   

The success of our business depends in part on achieving our strategic objectives, including through acquisitions and dispositions, and strategic investments. 

With respect to acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses, and strategic investments, the Company may not achieve expected returns and benefits as a result of various factors, including integration and collaboration challenges, such as personnel and technology. In addition, the Company may not achieve anticipated synergies from related integration activities. 

Further, acquisitions, dispositions and strategic investments may distract the Company’s management’s time and attention and disrupt our ongoing business operations or relationships with customers, employees, suppliers or other parties. However, the Company continues to evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help the Company achieve its strategic objectives, and to view acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy. 

After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, the transaction may remain subject to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms as well as the satisfaction of pre-closing conditions, which may prevent the Company from completing the transaction in a timely manner, or at all. From a workforce perspective, risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions include, among others, delays in anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, negative impacts on the Company’s relationship with labor unions, adverse effects on employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair the Company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business, and could have a material adverse effect on its competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

When the Company decides to sell assets or a business, the Company may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or executing alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the accomplishment of its strategic objectives. Alternatively, the Company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less than the Company had anticipated, or with the exclusion of assets that must be divested or run off separately. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, transition service agreements, guarantees, indemnities or other current or contingent financial obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the acquired or divested business, or other conditions outside the Company’s control, could affect its future financial results. 

In the context of acquisitions, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve any of the benefits that it might anticipate from such an acquisition and the attention and effort devoted to the integration of an acquired business could divert management’s attention from normal business operations. The Company may not achieve the full revenue growth expectations and cost synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition. 

Additionally, if the Company makes acquisitions, it may incur debt, assume contingent liabilities and/or additional risks, or create additional expenses, any of which might adversely affect its financial results. Any financing that the Company might need for acquisitions may only be available on terms that restrict its business or that impose additional costs that reduce its operating results. 

The Company may be unable to develop innovative products or stimulate customer demand. 

The worldwide markets for dental and medical products is highly competitive and is driven by rapid and significant technological change, change in consumer preferences, new intellectual property associated with that technological change, evolving industry standards, and new product introductions. Additionally, some markets for products are also subject to significant negative price pressures. The Company’s patent portfolio continues to change with patents expiring through the normal course of their life. There can be no assurance that the Company’s products will not lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete as a result of such factors, or that we will be able to generate any economic return on the Company’s investment in product development. If product demand decreases, our revenue and profit could be negatively impacted. Important factors that could cause demand for our products to decrease include changes in: 

•business conditions, including downturns in the dental industry, regional economies, and the overall economy; 

•the level of customers’ inventories; 

•competitive and pricing pressures, including actions taken by competitors; and 

•customer product needs and customer/patient lifecycle. 

14   

If the Company fails to further develop its innovation efforts or if the Company’s research and development does not effectively respond to changes in consumer preferences or market competition leading to technology or product obsolescence, the Company may lose market share and revenue. Additionally, if the Company’s products or technologies lose their competitive advantage or become noncompetitive or obsolete, the Company’s business could be negatively affected. The Company has identified new products as an important part of its growth opportunities. Additionally, there is no assurance that entirely new technology or approaches to dental treatment or competitors’ new products will not be introduced that could render the Company’s products obsolete. 

The Company’s ongoing business operations may be disrupted for a significant period of time, resulting in material operating costs and financial losses. 

The Company operates in more than 150 countries and the Company’s and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world. Potential events such as extreme weather, natural disasters, worker strikes and social and political actions, such as trade wars, or other events beyond our control, could impact the Company’s ongoing business operations, including potential critical third-party vendor disruptions or failure to adhere to contractual obligations affecting our supply chain and manufacturing needs or the loss of critical information technology and telecommunications systems. Although the Company maintains multiple manufacturing facilities, a large number of the products manufactured by the Company are manufactured in facilities that are the sole source of such products. As there are a limited number of alternative suppliers for these products, any disruption at a particular Company manufacturing facility could lead to delays, increased expenses, and may damage the Company’s business and results of operations. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, such events could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. 

Additionally, a significant portion of the Company’s injectable anesthetic products, orthodontic products, certain dental cutting instruments, catheters, nickel titanium products and certain other products and raw materials are purchased from a limited number of suppliers and in certain cases single source suppliers pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic renewal, some of which may also compete with the Company. As there are a limited number of suppliers for these products, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain an adequate supply of these products and raw materials in the future. Any delays in delivery of or shortages in these products could interrupt and delay manufacturing of the Company’s products and result in the cancellation of orders for these products. In addition, these suppliers could discontinue the manufacture or supply of these products to the Company at any time or supply products to competitors. The Company may not be able to identify and integrate alternative sources of supply in a timely fashion or at all. Any transition to alternate suppliers may result in delays in shipment and increased expenses and may limit the Company’s ability to deliver products to customers. 

The Company may fail to realize the expected benefits of its strategic initiatives, including its announced cost reduction and restructuring efforts. 

In order to operate more efficiently and control costs, the Company has announced in the past, and may announce in the future, restructuring plans or other major initiatives from time to time, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives that are intended to generate operating expense or cost of goods sold savings through direct and indirect overhead expense reductions as well as other savings. The failure to efficiently execute such initiatives as part of the Company’s business strategy could minimize the expected benefits to the organization resulting in potential impacts to ongoing operations and cost overruns. 

Additionally, the Company’s ability to achieve the benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions and other factors that we may not be able to control. The Company may also incur significant charges related to restructuring plans, which would reduce our profitability in the periods such charges are incurred. 

15   

Due to the complexities inherent in implementing these types of cost reduction and restructuring activities, and the quarterly phasing of related investments, the Company may fail to realize expected efficiencies and benefits, such as the goals for net sales growth, or may experience a delay in realizing such efficiencies and benefits, and its operations and business could be disrupted. Company management may be required to divert their focus to managing these disruptions, and implementation may require the agreement of third parties, such as labor unions or works councils. Risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, changes in restructuring plans that increase or decrease the number of employees affected, negative impact on the Company’s relationship with labor unions or works councils, adverse effects on employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair the Company’s ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or may otherwise harm its business, and could have a material adverse effect on its sales growth and other results of operations, cash flows or financial condition, or competitive position. 

The Company has recognized substantial goodwill impairment charges, most recently in 2020, and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future. 

The Company acquires other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. The Company reviews amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles for impairment at least annually. The valuation models used to determine the fair value of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are dependent upon various assumptions and reflect management’s best estimates.  

Following the recording of $3.5 billion in charges for impairment of certain businesses during 2017, 2018, and 2020, the Company had an aggregate amount of $4.0 billion in goodwill on its balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. In preparing the financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, the Company identified a triggering event and recorded a $157 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge associated with one reporting unit within the Technologies & Equipment segment. In addition, the Company tested the indefinite-lived intangible assets related to this business and determined that certain tradenames and trademarks were impaired, resulting in the recording of an impairment charge of $39 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, the Company has $612 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded on its balance sheet. 

The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analyses are sensitive to changes in key assumptions used, such as discount rates, revenue growth rates, perpetual revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and operating margin percentages of the business as well as current market conditions affecting the dental and medical device industries in both the U.S. and globally. If the assumptions and projections used in the analyses are not realized, it is possible that an additional impairment charge may need to be recorded in the future. Given the uncertainty in the marketplace and other factors affecting management’s assumptions underlying the Company’s discounted cash flow model, the Company’s current estimates could vary significantly in the future, which may result in a goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charge at that time. Additionally, valuations and impairments that are not complete, accurate, timely or appropriately recorded could result in potential financial misstatements and delays in impairment analysis. 

The Company’s failure to obtain issued patents and, consequently, to protect the Company’s proprietary technology could hurt the Company’s competitive position. 

The Company’s success will depend in part on the Company’s ability to obtain and enforce claims in our patents directed to the Company’s products, technologies and processes, both in the United States and in other countries. Risks and uncertainties that the Company faces with respect to the Company’s patents and patent applications include the following: 

•the pending patent applications that the Company has filed, or to which the Company has exclusive rights, may not result in issued patents or may take longer than the Company expects to result in issued patents; 

•the allowed claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection; 

•the Company may be unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; 

•the patents licensed or issued to the Company may not provide a competitive advantage; 

•other companies may challenge patents licensed or issued to the Company; 

•disputes may arise regarding inventions and corresponding ownership rights in inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by the Company and the Company’s respective licensors; and 

•other companies may design around the technologies patented by the Company. 

16   

The Company’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon the Company’s intellectual property rights or if the Company’s products are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. 

 The Company’s profitability could suffer if third parties infringe upon Dentsply Sirona’s intellectual property rights or misappropriate Dentsply Sirona’s technologies and trademarks for their own businesses. To protect Dentsply Sirona’s rights to Dentsply Sirona’s intellectual property, Dentsply Sirona relies on a combination of patent and trademark law, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and contractual arrangements with Dentsply Sirona’s employees, strategic partners and others. Dentsply Sirona cannot assure you that any of Dentsply Sirona’s patents, any of the patents of which Dentsply Sirona are a licensee or any patents which may be issued to Dentsply Sirona or which the Company may license in the future, will provide Dentsply Sirona with a competitive advantage or afford Dentsply Sirona protection against infringement by others, or that the patents will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by third parties, including Dentsply Sirona’s competitors. The protective steps that the Company has taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information. The Company may be unable to detect or protect against the unauthorized use or misappropriation of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, its intellectual property rights. Effective patent, trademark and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which Dentsply Sirona will offer, or intend to offer, its products. Any failure to adequately protect Dentsply Sirona’s intellectual property could devalue Dentsply Sirona’s proprietary content and impair Dentsply Sirona’s ability to compete effectively. Further, defending Dentsply Sirona’s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.  

Litigation may also be necessary to enforce Dentsply Sirona’s intellectual property rights or to defend against any claims of infringement of rights owned by third parties that are asserted against Dentsply Sirona. In addition, Dentsply Sirona may have to participate in one or more interference proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office or other foreign patent governing authorities, to determine the priority of inventions, which could result in substantial costs. Acquisitions by Dentsply Sirona of products or businesses that are found to infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and the resulting changes to the competitive landscape of the industry could further increase this risk. 

If Dentsply Sirona becomes involved in litigation or interference proceedings, Dentsply Sirona may incur substantial expense, and the proceedings may divert the attention of Dentsply Sirona’s technical and management personnel, even if Dentsply Sirona ultimately prevails. An adverse determination in proceedings of this type could subject the Company to significant liabilities, allow Dentsply Sirona’s competitors to market competitive products without obtaining a license from Dentsply Sirona, prohibit Dentsply Sirona from marketing Dentsply Sirona’s products or require the Company to seek licenses from third parties that may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If Dentsply Sirona cannot obtain such licenses, Dentsply Sirona may be restricted or prevented from commercializing Dentsply Sirona’s products. 

The enforcement, defense and prosecution of intellectual property rights, including the United States Patent and Trademark Office’s, the European Patent Office’s and other foreign patent offices’ interference proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings in the United States and elsewhere, involve complex legal and factual questions. As a result, these proceedings are costly and time-consuming, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to: 

•assert against others or defend Dentsply Sirona against claims of patent or trademark infringement; 

•enforce patents owned by, or licensed to Dentsply Sirona from, another party; 

•protect Dentsply Sirona’s trade secrets or know-how; or 

•determine the enforceability, scope and validity of Dentsply Sirona’s proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others. 

Changes in the Company’s credit ratings or macroeconomic impacts on credit markets may increase our cost of capital and limit financing options. 

The Company utilizes the short and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. The Company’s continued access to sources of liquidity depends on multiple factors, including global economic conditions, the condition of global credit markets, the availability of sufficient amounts of financing, operating performance, and credit ratings. Macroeconomic conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may result in significant disruption in the credit markets, which may adversely affect the Company’s ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives.  

Any adverse changes in our credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities which may in turn limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. There is no guarantee that additional debt financing will be available in the future to fund obligations, or that it will be available on  

17   

commercially reasonable terms, in which case we may need to seek other sources of funding. In addition, the terms of future debt agreements could include additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. 

Events related to the Audit and Finance Committee’s internal investigation may expose us to higher interest rates for additional indebtedness, whether as a result of credit rating downgrades or otherwise, and could restrict our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing on acceptable terms or at all. 

The Company has a significant amount of indebtedness. A breach of the covenants under the Company’s debt instruments outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. 

The Company has debt securities outstanding of approximately $1.9 billion. The Company also has the ability to incur up to $700 million of indebtedness under the revolving credit facility (“2018 Credit Facility”), as discussed below, and may incur significantly more indebtedness in the future. 

The Company’s current debt agreements contain a number of covenants and financial ratios, which the Company is required to satisfy. Under the Note Purchase Agreement dated December 11, 2015, the Company is required to maintain ratios of debt outstanding to total capital not to exceed the ratio of 0.6 to 1.0, and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization to interest expense of not less than 3.0 times, in each case, as such terms are defined in the Note Purchase Agreement. All of the Company’s outstanding debt agreements have been amended to reflect these covenants. The Company may need to reduce the amount of its indebtedness outstanding from time to time in order to comply with such ratios, though no assurance can be given that the Company will be able to do so. The Company’s failure to maintain such ratios or a breach of the other covenants under its debt agreements outstanding from time to time could result in an event of default under the applicable agreement. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and may result in the acceleration of any other indebtedness. 

In addition, the requisite lenders under its revolving credit facility and the applicable noteholders have agreed to an extension of time for delivery of certain of the Company’s financial statements and the related certificates, until November 14, 2022. While we have obtained all necessary consents to date, any future violations of the covenants under our debt agreements may hurt our reputation and credibility with our stockholders and our debt holders and may compromise our future ability to finance our operations through the public equity or debt markets. 

Breach of covenants could have additional negative consequences including, but not limited to the following: 

•making it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations with respect to its indebtedness; 

•requiring the Company to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness, which would reduce the funds the Company has available for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, research and development and acquisitions; and 

•reducing the Company’s flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in its business and market conditions. 

The Company may not be able to repay its outstanding debt in the event that it does not generate sufficient cash flow to service its debts and cross default provisions may be triggered due to a breach of covenants under our existing indebtedness. 

Dentsply Sirona’s ability to make payments on its indebtedness and contractual obligations, and to fund its operations depends on its future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors and the interest rate environment that are beyond its control. Although management believes that the Company has and will continue to have sufficient liquidity, there can be no assurance that Dentsply Sirona’s business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service its debt, pay its contractual obligations and operate its business. 

Additionally, Dentsply Sirona’s existing borrowing documentation contains a number of covenants and financial ratios, which it is required to satisfy. Any breach of any such covenants or restrictions, the most restrictive of which pertain to asset dispositions, maintenance of certain levels of net worth, and prescribed ratios of indebtedness to total capital and operating income excluding depreciation and amortization of interest expense, would result in a default under the existing borrowing documentation that would permit the lenders to declare all borrowings under such documentation to be immediately due and payable and, through cross-default provisions, would entitle Dentsply Sirona’s other lenders to accelerate their loans. Dentsply Sirona may not be able to meet its obligations under its outstanding indebtedness in the event that any cross-default provisions are triggered or to the extent that no other parties are willing to extend financing. 

18   

The Company hedging and cash management transactions may expose the Company to loss or limit the Company’s potential gains. 

As part of Dentsply Sirona’s risk management program, we use foreign currency exchange forward contracts. While intended to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, these transactions may limit Dentsply Sirona’s potential gains or expose Dentsply Sirona to loss. Should Dentsply Sirona’s counterparties to such transactions or the sponsors of the exchanges through which these transactions are offered fail to honor their obligations due to financial distress or otherwise, we would be exposed to potential losses or the inability to recover anticipated gains from these transactions. 

We enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts as economic hedges of trade commitments or anticipated commitments denominated in currencies other than the functional currency to mitigate the effects of changes in currency rates. Although we do not enter into these instruments for trading purposes or speculation, and although Dentsply Sirona’s management believes all of these instruments are economically effective for accounting purposes as hedges of underlying physical transactions, these foreign exchange commitments are dependent on timely performance by Dentsply Sirona’s counterparties. Their failure to perform could result in Dentsply Sirona having to close these hedges without the anticipated underlying transaction and could result in losses if foreign currency exchange rates have changed. 

We enter into interest rate swap agreements from time to time to manage some of Dentsply Sirona’s exposure to interest rate volatility. These swap agreements involve risks, such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations under these arrangements. In addition, these arrangements may not be effective in reducing Dentsply Sirona’s exposure to changes in interest rates. If such events occur, Dentsply Sirona’s results of operations may be adversely affected. 

Most of Dentsply Sirona’s cash deposited with banks is not insured and would be subject to the risk of bank failure. Dentsply Sirona’s total liquidity also depends in part on the availability of funds under Dentsply Sirona’s 2018 Credit Facility. The failure of any bank in which we deposit Dentsply Sirona’s funds or that is part of Dentsply Sirona’s 2018 Credit Facility could reduce the amount of cash we have available for operations and additional investments in Dentsply Sirona’s business. 

Certain of the Company’s products are dependent on consumer discretionary spending. 

Certain dental specialty products and dental equipment and related products that support discretionary dental procedures may be susceptible to unfavorable changes in economic conditions. Decreases in consumer discretionary spending could negatively affect the Company’s business and result in a decline in sales and financial performance. 

RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS 

Due to the Company’s international operations, the Company is exposed to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates. 

Due to the international nature of Dentsply Sirona’s business, movements in foreign exchange rates may impact the consolidated statements of operations, consolidated balance sheets and cash flows of the Company. With approximately two-thirds of the Company’s sales located outside the U.S., the Company’s consolidated net sales are impacted negatively by the strengthening or positively by the weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to certain foreign currencies. Additionally, movements in certain foreign exchange rates may unfavorably or favorably impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity as a number of the Company’s manufacturing and distribution operations are located outside of the U.S. Although the Company currently uses and may in the future use certain financial instruments to attempt to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective or that they will not create additional financial obligations on the Company. 

Due to the international nature of the Company’s business, including increasing exposure to markets outside of the U.S. and Europe, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our business and financial performance. 

Approximately two-thirds of the Company’s sales are located in regions outside the United States. In addition, we anticipate that sales outside of the U.S. and Europe will continue to expand and account for a significant portion of Dentsply Sirona’s revenue. Operating internationally is subject to a number of uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the following: 

•economic and political instability; 

•import or export licensing requirements; 

•additional compliance-related risks; 

•trade restrictions and tariffs; 

19   

•product registration requirements; 

•longer payment cycles; 

•changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs; 

•potentially adverse tax consequences; and 

•trade policy changes 

Specifically, changes in or the imposition of tariffs could make it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to other countries. These measures could also result in increased costs for goods imported into the United States. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in lowering our margin on products sold. We cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers and our suppliers, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Certain of these risks may be heightened as a result of changing political climates which may lead to changes in areas such as trade restrictions and tariffs, regulatory requirements and exchange rate fluctuations, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. For example, as a result of escalating tensions and the subsequent invasion of Ukraine by Russia, the U.S. and other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia, including its major financial institutions and certain other businesses and individuals. Russia may respond in kind, and the continuation of the conflict may result in additional sanctions being enacted by the U.S., other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, or other countries. The impact of these sanctions, along with the spillover effect of ongoing civil, political and economic disturbances on surrounding areas, may significantly devalue currencies utilized by the Company or have other adverse impacts including increased costs of raw materials and inputs, or manufacturing or shipping delays. Export controls implemented as part of sanctions could also restrict the sale of equipment or products containing U.S. developed software and technology into Russia.  

For the year ended December 31, 2021, net sales in Russia and Ukraine were approximately 3% of the Company’s consolidated net sales, and assets in these countries were $63 million. The impact of these events on economic conditions in the region is currently unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  

RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY ENVIRONMENTS 

Changes in or interpretations of tax rules, operating structures, transfer pricing regulations, country profitability mix and regulations may adversely affect the Company’s effective tax rates. 

As a company with international operations, we are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income-based taxes, in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable at the time made, the actual outcome could differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements (and such differences may be material). If the IRS, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions we take, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations, and changes in interpretations of tax laws. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change.  

Our corporate structure is intended to enhance our operational and financial efficiency and increase our overall profitability. The tax authorities of the countries in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for transfer pricing which could increase our effective tax rate (and such increase may be material). In addition, certain governments are considering, and may adopt, tax reform measures that could significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and other government bodies have focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations, including, in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where payments are made from affiliates in jurisdictions with high tax rates to affiliates in jurisdictions with lower tax rates. It is possible that these reform measures could increase our effective tax rate (and such increase may be material) and impact our financial position. 

20   

Dentsply Sirona may be unable to obtain necessary product approvals and marketing clearances. 

Dentsply Sirona must obtain certain approvals by, and marketing clearances from, governmental authorities, including the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries to market and sell Dentsply Sirona’s products in those countries. These agencies regulate the marketing, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, advertising, sale and distribution of medical devices. The FDA enforces additional regulations regarding the safety of X-ray emitting devices. Dentsply Sirona’s products are currently regulated by such authorities and Dentsply Sirona’s new products require approval by, or marketing clearance from, various governmental authorities, including the FDA. Various U.S. states also impose manufacturing, licensing, and distribution regulations. 

The FDA review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. A 510(k) application is required in order to market certain classes of new or modified medical devices. If specifically required by the FDA, a pre-market approval, or PMA, may be necessary. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming. They may delay or hinder a product’s timely entry into the marketplace. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the review or approval process for these products by the FDA or any other applicable governmental authority will occur in a timely fashion, if at all, or that additional regulations will not be adopted or current regulations amended in such a manner as will adversely affect us. The FDA also oversees the content of advertising and marketing materials relating to medical devices which have received FDA clearance. Failure to comply with the FDA’s advertising guidelines may result in the imposition of penalties. 

The Company is also subject to other federal, state and local laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted and inadequate employee training for critical compliance and regulatory requirements may result in the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

Similar to the FDA review process, the European Union (“EU”) review process typically requires extended proceedings pertaining to the safety and efficacy of new products. Such proceedings, which must be completed prior to marketing a new medical device, are potentially expensive and time consuming and may delay or prevent a product’s entry into the marketplace. 

The Company’s products that fall into the category of Class I as classified by EU Medical Device Directive were mandated to be certified under the new European Union Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”). These regulations as well applied to all medical device manufacturers who market their medical devices in EU and all had to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under MDR in order to continue to sell those products in the European Union (“EU”). Although all medical device manufacturers were required to certify their Class I products by May 2021, the EU MDR regulations for additional Classes of medical devices is mandated to be fully enforceable by May 2024. This also includes completion of certified quality management systems to manufacturers quality management systems. Dentsply Sirona remains focused on ensuring that all its products that are considered to be medical device will be fully certified as required by the EU MDR dates and timelines. Additionally, the United Kingdom (“UK”) has negotiated an exit from the EU, “Brexit” and, as a result, the EU CE marking will be recognized in the UK through June 2023. Following June 2023, the UK may impose its own differing regulatory requirements for products being imported from the EU into the UK. 

Failure to comply with these rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business. Also, these regulations may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require the Company to make changes in operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private regulators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks. 

Inadequate levels of reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payors for procedures using Dentsply Sirona’s products may cause Dentsply Sirona’s revenue to decline. 

Third-party payors, including government health administration authorities, private health care insurers and other organizations regulate the reimbursement of fees related to certain diagnostic procedures or medical treatments. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. While Dentsply Sirona cannot predict what effect the policies of government entities and other third-party payors will have on future sales of our products, there can be no assurance that such policies would not cause Dentsply Sirona’s revenue to decline. 

21   

Challenges may be asserted against the Company’s products due to real or perceived quality, health or environmental issues. 

The Company manufactures and sells a wide portfolio of dental and medical device products. While the Company endeavors to ensure that its products are safe and effective, there can be no assurance that there may not be challenges from time to time regarding the real or perceived quality, health or environmental impact of the Company’s products or certain raw material components of the Company’s products. Dentsply Sirona manufactures and sells dental filling materials that may contain bisphenol-A, commonly called BPA. BPA is found in many everyday items, such as plastic bottles, foods, detergents and toys, and may be found in certain dental composite materials or sealants either as a by-product of other ingredients that have degraded, or as a trace material left over from the manufacture of other ingredients used in such composites or sealants. The FDA currently allows the use of BPA in dental materials, medical devices, and food packaging. Nevertheless, public reports and concerns regarding the potential hazards of BPA could contribute to a perceived safety risk for the Company’s products that contain mercury or BPA. Adverse publicity about the quality or safety of our products, whether or not ultimately based on fact, may have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results and legal and regulatory developments in this area may lead to litigation and/or product limitations or discontinuation. 

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations relating to health care fraud, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to Dentsply Sirona’s operations, which could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona’s business. 

Dentsply Sirona is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders relating to health care fraud, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010 (c.23), Brazil’s Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12,846) and China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission (“NHFPC”) circulars No. 49 and No. 50. Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payors and programs. Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing, of items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payors and programs. 

The U.S. government has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other. As a result, we regularly review and revise Dentsply Sirona’s marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance. In addition, under the reporting and disclosure obligations of the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act and similar foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, such as France’s Loi Bertrand and rules issued by Denmark’s Health and Medicines Authority, the general public and government officials will be provided with access to detailed information with regard to payments or other transfers of value to certain practitioners (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals) by applicable drug and device manufacturers subject to such reporting and disclosure obligations, which includes us. This information may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. 

Failure to comply with health care fraud laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse impact on Dentsply Sirona’s business. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require Dentsply Sirona to make changes in Dentsply Sirona’s operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses. Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs. In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial, regulatory authorities, increasing compliance risks. 

We cannot predict whether changes in applicable laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, or the interpretation thereof, or changes in Dentsply Sirona’s services or marketing practices in response, could adversely affect Dentsply Sirona’s business.

Dentsply Sirona’s business is subject to extensive, complex and changing domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, directives, circulars and orders that failure to comply with which, if not complied with, could subject us to civil or criminal penalties or other liabilities. 

Dentsply Sirona is subject to extensive domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders which are administered by various international, federal and state governmental authorities, including, among others, the FDA, the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the United States Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), the Bureau of Industry and Security of the United States Department of Commerce (“BIS”), the United States Federal Trade Commission, the United States Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and other similar domestic and foreign authorities. These laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders include, but are not limited to, the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the European Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (“MDD”) (1993) (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder), the Federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH Act”), the Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), France’s Data Protection Act of 1978 (rev. 2004), the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and similar international anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various environmental regulations such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Health Care Reform Law”), and regulations relating to trade, import and export controls and economic sanctions. Such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders are complex and are subject to change.  

On December 31, 2020, the Company acquired Byte, a leading provider in the direct-to-consumer, doctor-directed clear aligner market. Byte’s business in the U.S. is subject to various state laws, rules and policies which govern the practice of dentistry within such state. Byte contracts with an expansive nationwide network of independent licensed dentists and orthodontists for the provision of clinical services, including the oversight and control of each customer’s clinical treatment; however, there can be no assurance that such business model will not be challenged as the corporate practice of dentistry by state governmental authorities, trade associations, or others. Additionally, future legislative or regulatory changes within such states may have a negative impact on Byte’s business model. 

Compliance with the numerous applicable existing and new laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders could require us to incur substantial regulatory compliance costs. There can be no assurance that governmental authorities will not raise compliance concerns or perform audits to confirm compliance with such laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders. For example, most of the Company’s products are classified as medical devices or pharmaceuticals which are subject to extensive regulations promulgated by the U.S. federal government, state governments and comparable regulatory agencies in other countries, including the requirement to obtain licenses for the manufacture or distribution of such products. Failure to comply with applicable laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars or orders could result in a range of governmental enforcement actions, including fines or penalties, injunctions and/or criminal or other civil proceedings. Any such actions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated revenue and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. 

RISKS RELATED TO OWNERSHIP OF OUR COMMON STOCK 

The Company’s quarterly operating results and market price for the Company’s common stock may continue to be volatile. 

Dentsply Sirona experiences significant fluctuations in quarterly sales and earnings due to a number of factors, some of which are substantially outside of the Company’s control, including but not limited to: 

•the impact of COVID-19; 

•the execution of the Company’s restructuring plan; 

•the complexity of the Company’s organization; 

•the timing of new product introductions by Dentsply Sirona and its competitors; 

•the timing of industry trade shows; 

•changes in customer inventory levels; 

•developments in government or third party payor reimbursement policies; 

•changes in customer preferences and product mix; 

•the Company’s ability to supply products to meet customer demand; 

•fluctuations in manufacturing costs; 

•changes in income tax laws and incentives which could create adverse tax consequences; 

•competitors’ sales promotions; 

23   

•fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and 

•general economic conditions, as well as those specific to the healthcare industry and related industries. 

As a result, the Company may fail to meet the expectations of investors and securities analysts, which could cause its stock price to decline. Quarterly fluctuations generally result in net sales and operating profits historically being higher in the second and fourth quarters. The Company typically implements most of its price changes early in the fourth quarter or beginning of the year. These price changes, other marketing and promotional programs, which are offered to customers from time to time in the ordinary course of business, the management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. Net sales and operating profits generally have been lower in the first and third quarters, primarily due not only to increased sales in the quarters preceding these quarters, but also due to the impact of holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe. 

Certain provisions in the Company’s governing documents, and of Delaware law, may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire Dentsply Sirona. 

Certain provisions of Dentsply Sirona’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws and of Delaware law could have the effect of making it difficult for a third party to acquire control of Dentsply Sirona. Such provisions include, among others, a provision allowing the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock having rights senior to those of the common stock and certain requirements which make it difficult for stockholders to amend Dentsply Sirona’s By-laws and prevent them from calling special meetings of stockholders. Delaware law imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between the Company and any “interested stockholder” with beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the Company’s outstanding common stock. 

GENERAL RISKS 

The loss of members of our senior management and the resulting management transition might harm our future operating results. 

 On April 11, 2022, the Company announced that its Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer had resigned from his position effective May 6, 2022. Additionally, on April 19, 2022, the Company announced that it had terminated its Chief Executive Officer, effective immediately. The Board of Directors appointed an Interim Chief Executive Officer, effective as of April 19, 2022, and Interim Chief Financial Officer which became effective on May 6, 2022. On August 25th, the Company announced the appointment of its new Chief Executive Officer, which became effective on September 12, 2022, and on September 22, 2022 the Company announced the appointment of its new Chief Financial Officer, which became effective on September 26, 2022. These leadership transitions along with other senior management changes may be inherently difficult to manage and cause operational and administrative inefficiencies, added costs, decreased employee morale, uncertainty and decreased productivity among our employees, increased likelihood of turnover, and the loss of personnel with deep institutional knowledge, which could result in significant disruptions to our operations. In addition, we must successfully integrate the new management team members within our organization in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. These changes could also increase the volatility of our stock price. If we are unable to mitigate these or other similar risks, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 

Talent gaps and failure to manage and retain top talent may impact the Company’s ability to grow the business. 

The Company’s success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage its human capital through talent acquisition, engagement, development, and retention. To achieve the Company’s strategic initiatives, the Company needs to attract, manage, and retain employees with the right skills, competencies and experiences to support the growth of the business and the failure to attract and retain such employees to fill key roles may adversely affect our business performance, competitive position and future prospects. The Company also must retain a pipeline of team members to provide for continuity of succession for senior executive positions. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, the Company must offer competitive compensation and effectively manage employee performance and development. Our inability to attract and retain talent may negatively impact business continuity, new product launches, and innovation initiatives. Further, such organizational challenges may make it difficult to maintain the Company’s culture, resulting in employees not adhering to the desired values of the organization. 

The Company faces the inherent risk of litigation and claims. 

The Company faces the risk of purported securities class actions, investigations by governmental agencies, product liability and other types of legal actions or claims, including possible recall actions affecting the Company’s products. The Company has insurance policies, including directors’ and officers’ insurance and product liability insurance, covering these risks in amounts that are considered adequate; however, the Company cannot provide assurance that the maintained coverage is sufficient to cover future claims or that the coverage will be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost. Also, other types of claims asserted against the Company may not be covered by insurance. A successful claim brought against the Company in excess of available insurance, or another type of claim which is uninsured or that results in significant adverse publicity against the Company, could harm its business and overall cash flows of the Company. 

Various parties, including the Company, own and maintain patents and other intellectual property rights applicable to the dental and medical device fields. Although the Company believes it operates in a manner that does not infringe upon any third-party intellectual property rights, it is possible that a party could assert that one or more of the Company’s products infringe upon such party’s intellectual property and force the Company to pay damages and/or discontinue the sale of certain products. 

Additionally, Dentsply Sirona generally warrants each of the Company’s products against defects in materials and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of shipment or installation plus any extended warranty period purchased by the customer. The future costs associated with providing product warranties could be material. Successful product warranty claims brought against Dentsply Sirona could reduce its profits and/or impair its financial condition, and damage the Company’s reputation. 

24   

Climate change and related natural disasters could negatively impact the Company’s business and financial results. 

The Company operates in more than 150 countries and its suppliers’ manufacturing facilities are located in multiple locations around the world. Any natural or other disaster in such a location or the increased frequency of extreme weather could disrupt the production and distribution of our products in these locations. Increasing natural disasters in connection with climate change could also impact our third-party vendors, service providers or other stakeholders, including disruptions on supply chains or information technology or other necessary services for our Company. 

Federal, state, and local governments are beginning to respond to climate change issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new legislation or regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements. Legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, could adversely affect our operations and financial results.
