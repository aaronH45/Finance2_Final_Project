Business Segments

Commencing with the second quarter of 2021, the Company operates its business in four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, Prescription Technology Solutions (“RxTS”), Medical-Surgical Solutions, and International. The Company’s equity method investment in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare JV”), which was split-off from McKesson in the fourth quarter of 2020, has been included in Other for retrospective periods presented.

Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar and over-the-counter (“OTC”) pharmaceutical drugs, and other healthcare-related products. This segment provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.

Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment serves our biopharma and life sciences partners and patients. RxTS addresses medication challenges for patients throughout their journeys by working across healthcare to connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma companies to deliver innovative access and adherence solutions as well as dispensing support services, third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support designed to benefit stakeholders. 

Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. We offer more than 285,000 national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson’s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers within the United States (“U.S.”).

Our International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in 11 European countries and Canada where we own, partner or franchise with retail pharmacies, and support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment:

Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides distribution and logistics services for branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and OTC pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products to customers. This business provides solutions and services to pharmacies, hospitals, oncology and other specialty practices, pharmaceutical manufacturers, biopharma partners, physicians, payers, and patients throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We also source generic pharmaceutical drugs through our ClarusONE Sourcing Services LLP joint venture with Walmart (“ClarusONE”). 

Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment operates and serves customers through a network of 29 distribution centers, including two strategic redistribution centers.

We continue to implement information systems to help achieve greater consistency and accuracy both internally and for our customers.

We have four primary customer pharmaceutical distribution channels: (i) retail national accounts, which include national and regional chains, food and drug combinations, mail order pharmacies, and mass merchandisers, (ii) community pharmacies and health (formerly described as independent, small, and medium chain retail pharmacies), (iii) institutional healthcare providers such as hospitals, health systems, integrated delivery networks, and long-term care providers, and (iv) oncology, biopharma, and other specialty partners.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Oncology, Biopharma, and Other Specialty Partners:

The U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides a range of solutions to oncology and other specialty practices and offers community specialists (oncologists, rheumatologists, ophthalmologists, urologists, neurologists, and other specialists) an extensive set of customizable products and services designed to strengthen core practice operations, enhance value-based care delivery, and expand their service offering to patients. Community-based physicians in this business have broad flexibility and discretion to select the products and commitment levels that best meet their practice needs. Services in provider solutions include specialty drug distribution, group purchasing organizations (“GPO”) like Onmark®, technology solutions, practice consulting services, and vaccine distribution, including our exclusive distributor relationship with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (“CDC”) Vaccines for Children program. Additionally, to support the U.S. efforts to fight the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus (“COVID-19”), this segment has been distributing certain COVID-19 vaccines since December 2020 at the direction of the U.S. government. 

This business provides a variety of solutions, including practice operations, healthcare information technology, revenue cycle management and managed care contracting solutions, evidence-based guidelines, and quality measurements to support U.S. Oncology Network (“USON”), one of the nation’s largest networks of physician-led, integrated, community-based oncology practices dedicated to advancing high-quality, evidence-based cancer care. We also support U.S. Oncology Research, one of the nation’s largest research networks, specializing in oncology clinical trials.

This segment includes our Ontada business, providing software to support the clinical, financial, and operational needs of our oncology practice partners. Ontada also partners with oncology providers and biopharma partners to perform real-world evidence studies, retrospective research, and to provide clinical data insights, advisory solutions and education opportunities.

This segment also offers solutions which enable its customers to drive greater efficiencies in their day to day operations, effectively managing their inventories and complying with complex government regulations. Solutions include McKesson Pharmacy Systems, MacroHelix, and Supply Logix, all of which provide innovative software technology and services that support retail pharmacies and hospitals.

When we discuss specialty products or services, we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage, and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term “specialty” may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors.

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment:

Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment works across healthcare to connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma companies to deliver medication access and adherence solutions that support patients from first prescription fill to ongoing therapy, regardless of their insurance coverage. RxTS has connections with most electronic health record systems, over 50,000 pharmacies, more than 750,000 providers, most payers and pharmacy benefit managers, and over 650 biopharma brands representing most therapeutic areas. Through its industry connections and ability to navigate the healthcare ecosystem, RxTS accelerates innovative solutions created to benefit healthcare stakeholders. Its comprehensive solution suites span across the entire patient journey, including medication access and affordability, prescription decision support and dispensing support services, as well as third-party logistics and wholesale distribution support, to help increase speed to therapy, reduce prescription abandonment, and support improved health outcomes for the patient. In the past year, RxTS helped patients save more than $6 billion on brand and specialty medications, helped to prevent more than 9 million prescriptions from being abandoned due to affordability challenges, and helped patients access their medicine more than 67 million times.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment: 

Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivers medical-supply distribution, logistics, biomedical maintenance, and other services to healthcare providers across the alternate-site spectrum. Our more than 275,000 customers include physician offices, surgery centers, post-acute care facilities, hospital reference labs, and home health agencies. We partner with manufacturers and channel partners to support our key target end-markets, including primary care, extended care, government, and other markets. We distribute medical-surgical supplies (such as gloves, needles, syringes, and wound care products), infusion pumps, laboratory equipment, and pharmaceuticals. Through a network of distribution centers within the U.S., we offer more than 285,000 products from national brand manufacturers and McKesson’s own brand of high-quality products. Through the right mix of products and services, we help improve efficiencies, profitability, and compliance. We also never lose focus on helping customers improve patient and business outcomes. We develop customized plans to address the product, operational, and clinical support needs of our customers, including tackling inventory management, reducing administrative burdens, and training and educating clinical staff. We deliver for our customers, so they can deliver and care for their patients. Additionally, under contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and Pfizer, Inc., McKesson’s Medical-Surgical business leverages its expertise to manage the assembly, storage, and distribution of supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as well as some of the sourcing of those supplies. The kits are produced and distributed at the direction of HHS to support the administration of all COVID-19 vaccines approved in the U.S. 

International Segment:

Our International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in 11 European countries where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies and operate through two businesses: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Retail Pharmacy. Our operations in Canada support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions to customers, and through several retail health and wellness brands, across Canada.

Our European Pharmaceutical Distribution business delivers pharmaceutical and other healthcare-related products to pharmacies across Europe. This business functions as a vital link, using technology-enabled management systems at our regional wholesale branches to connect manufacturers to retail pharmacies, supplying medicines and other products sold in pharmacies.

Our European Retail Pharmacy business serves patients and consumers in European countries directly through approximately 2,000 of our own pharmacies and 4,800 participant pharmacies operating under brand partnership arrangements. This business provides customers with traditional prescription pharmaceuticals, non-prescription products, and medical services, as well as e-commerce operating under the Lloyds pharmacy branding in Belgium, Ireland, and Italy. In addition, we partner with independent pharmacies under local banner programs.

In fiscal 2022, we announced our intention to exit our businesses in Europe. We entered into an agreement to sell certain of our businesses in the European Union (“E.U.”) located in France, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, Belgium, and Slovenia, our German headquarters and wound-care business, part of a shared services center in Lithuania, and our ownership stake in a joint venture in the Netherlands (“E.U. disposal group”). We also completed the sale of our Austrian business. On April 6, 2022, we completed the sale of our retail and distribution businesses in the United Kingdom (“U.K. disposal group”). Of the owned and banner pharmacies referenced above, all except for approximately 300 owned and 100 partner pharmacies are included within these disposal groups. In executing our strategy to exit Europe, we continue to evaluate suitable exit alternatives for our remaining businesses in Norway and Denmark. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our European divestiture activities.

McKesson Canada is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors in Canada. The wholesale business delivers products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a national network of distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Beyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation and technology solutions to its retail and hospital customers. Additionally, McKesson Canada provides comprehensive specialty health services to Canadians, including a national network of specialty pharmacies, personalized patient care and support programs, and INVIVA, Canada’s first and largest accredited network of private infusion clinics. McKesson Canada also owns and operates PDCI, Canada’s leading market access consultancy, supporting manufacturers as they introduce new products into the Canadian market.

The Canada retail business includes over 2,700 banner pharmacies under the IDA®, Guardian®, The Medicine Shoppe®, Remedy’sRx®, Proxim®, and Uniprix® banners, and approximately 400 owned pharmacies under the RexallTM brand where we provide patients with greater choice and access, integrated pharmacy care and industry-leading service levels. McKesson Canada also owns and operates Well.caTM, a leading Canadian online health and wellness retailer.

Other:

Change Healthcare: Our equity ownership interest in the Change Healthcare JV, a joint venture, was accounted for using the equity method of accounting. The Change Healthcare JV provided software and analytics, network solutions, and technology-enabled services that deliver wide-ranging financial, operational, and clinical benefits to payers, providers and consumers. On March 10, 2020, we completed the separation of our interest in the Change Healthcare JV through a split-off transaction. This transaction reduced our investment in the Change Healthcare JV to zero. Refer to Financial Note 4, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information related to this transaction.

Restructuring, Business Combinations, Investments, and Divestitures 

We have undertaken additional strategic initiatives in recent years designed to further focus on our core healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Notes 2, 3, and 4, “Held for Sale,” “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” and “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” respectively, to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

Competition

We operate in highly competitive environments, primarily in North America and Europe. In recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. In the pharmaceutical distribution environment in which our U.S. Pharmaceutical and International segments operate, we face strong competition from international, national, regional, and local full-line, short-line, and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies, and large payer organizations. We consider our largest competitors in distribution, wholesaling, and logistics to be AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc. Our retail businesses, which primarily operate in our International segment, face competition from various global, national, regional, and local retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies.

Our RxTS business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other biopharma services companies, software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition in this business varies in size from large to small companies, in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered.

Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, home health care agencies, and other alternative sites with competition from a wide range of national and regional medical supply and equipment distributors throughout the U.S.

In addition, we compete with other service providers and healthcare manufacturers, as well as other potential customers of our businesses, which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. We believe that our scale and diversity of product and service offerings are our primary competitive advantages. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer.

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Licenses

McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovations and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.

We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third-party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 

We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations as well as our products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.

Human Capital 

Our vision for a healthier world begins with our employees, who bring our mission to life every day. We deliver programs that focus on improving employee health and wellness, creating opportunities for growth and development, and providing an inclusive workplace where our employees can reach their full potential. At March 31, 2022, we had approximately 75,000 employees worldwide, including 17,000 part-time employees, as well as 33,000 employees in the U.S. and 13,000 employees in Canada. We also supplement our work force with contractors and/or consultants for certain business projects, processes, and/or operations as demand requires, including for programs such as the COVID-19 vaccine distribution and related ancillary supply kit programs. During 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell the E.U. disposal group which is expected to close within the second half of fiscal year 2023 and completed the sale of our Austrian business. On April 6, 2022, we completed the sale of the U.K. disposal group. At March 31, 2022, we had approximately 29,000 employees in Europe, including 11,000 part-time employees, the majority of whom we expect will be transferred with the E.U. disposal group and U.K. disposal group. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Held for Sale,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our European divestiture activities. 

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”): We are committed to making the principles of DEI integral to everything we do because we believe building a healthier future is everyone’s business. We build successful teams by recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent and we recognize our culture of inclusion and belonging as an important element that drives long-term shareholder value. We have 10 employee resource groups (“ERGs”) that are voluntary, employee-led, company-sponsored groups that focus on making a difference among our U.S. employees. ERGs can help employees make authentic connections, showcase leadership skills, and create a positive impact.

McKESSON CORPORATION

At March 31, 2022, women and people of color represented the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The data for our metrics is derived from our voluntary self-identification process as of March 31, 2022 and therefore represents our best estimate at this time. For fiscal year 2021, our metrics did not include our employees related to USON as the data was not available. 

(2)Represents our leadership at the vice president level and above.

(3)Represents worldwide employees. In North America, women represent 60% of “McKesson Overall” and 48% of “McKesson Leadership.”

(4)Represents U.S. employees only because the data for Canada and Europe is not available.

(5)People of Color includes the following races and ethnicities: American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, or Two or More Races.

Culture and Leadership: What sets McKesson apart as an exceptional place is our people. Our employees understand that together, unified by our global I2CARE and ILEAD principles, we fulfill our mission of improving care in every setting. Our I2CARE values (Integrity, Inclusion, Customer-First, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) are foundational to all that we do, and who we are as a company. ILEAD (Inspire, Leverage, Execute, Advance, Develop) is our common definition of and shared commitment to leadership. By embracing this commitment, we bring out the best in ourselves and position McKesson to continue to drive better health – for our company, our customers, and the patients they serve – for years to come. We promote leadership behaviors through culture initiatives that offer practical tips on how to debate, decide, and commit, be open and candid, and maintain an enterprise-first mindset when navigating conversations affecting operations within and across our business segments. These values and behaviors help make McKesson unique.

Investment in Employees: To support employee growth and development, we provide regular feedback and training, and work to create and maintain an inclusive environment where everyone can bring their authentic self to work and know they are appreciated, with their perspectives heard and considered. Through training, we encourage leaders to embrace diverse perspectives and lead inclusively. Employee development programs include training, coaching, and 360-degree assessments, which can support the careers of future leaders and their teams. We offer financial assistance programs for higher education opportunities that support employees’ career growth at the company. To provide compensation that is focused on attracting and retaining talent with the skills and experience necessary for a specific role, our compensation program is built on a set of quantifiable factors defined by our guiding principles of internal equity, market competitiveness, and pay for performance. We operate in several countries and our benefits offerings vary accordingly. We offer health and wellness benefits to advance the physical, mental, and social well-being of our people, savings programs to help prepare them for retirement, and flexible work arrangements, among other offerings, when possible. We seek employee feedback through an annual employee opinion survey, which assesses our employees’ levels of engagement, commitment, and overall satisfaction using industry benchmarks, and we then design action plans to improve those metrics.

As broader U.S. labor markets continue to be challenging and evolving, we continue our dedication to recruiting and retaining qualified employees across the organization. During 2022, we committed to increasing base pay and providing long-term incentive awards for certain markets and job classes as necessary to retain top talent. We also made investments in our talent acquisition team by adding recruiters, systems, and process improvements to strengthen our ability to attract employees and reduce the lead time to fill open positions as well as improve our employee value proposition. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we offer medical benefits covering COVID-19 related visits, testing (including over-the-counter tests), treatment and vaccines, telehealth options, and emergency paid time off (“PTO”). During the first quarter of 2022, we approved changes to our real estate strategy to increase efficiencies and support flexibility for our employees, as discussed in Financial Note 3, “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges, Net,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our North American future of work approach is based on four pillars: best talent and co-location, flexibility, mobility, and a partial remote work model for certain employees.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Health and Safety: Our security and safety departments employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to help identify and prevent or mitigate any potential risks. This includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for both physical and electronic security. We routinely assess facilities to closely monitor adherence to established security and safety standards. If we identify a vulnerability, it is documented, and the facility prepares an action plan. Our employees receive specialized training related to their role, work setting, and equipment used in their work environment. As our processes evolve, we update relevant safety training modules, which may include new employee training programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been, and continues to be, protecting the health and safety of our employees, customers, patients, and communities while also safeguarding the healthcare supply chain. The various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, including telecommuting and work-from-home policies, restricted travel, and enhanced safety measures, are intended to limit employee exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 as they perform their jobs while also providing employee support programs and a sense of belonging. During 2022, we implemented COVID-19 vaccination protocols designed to be consistent with federal, state, and local laws and with customer requirements for our U.S. and Canada employees. For additional information on our response to COVID-19 in the workplace, refer to the COVID-19 section of “Trends and Uncertainties” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II included in this Annual Report.

Government Regulation

McKesson, generally and in many of the highly regulated industries in which it operates, is subject to oversight by various federal, state, and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere. The Company incurs significant expense and makes large investments to enable it to comply with regulations and guidance promulgated by those governmental entities. A failure, or alleged failure, by the Company to comply with statutes, regulations, or other laws could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s business operations, reputation, results of operations, and financial and competitive position.

Controlled Substances: We are subject to the operating and security standards of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), HHS, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, and comparable agencies in the U.S. and other countries. We maintain extensive controlled substance monitoring and reporting programs at considerable expense in order to help us meet those standards. We have incurred monetary penalties and licensing sanctions pursuant to these requirements and future allegations of noncompliance could result in our inability to obtain, maintain, or renew permits, licenses, or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses.

Additionally, the Company is a defendant in many litigation matters alleging claims related to its distribution of controlled substances (opioids), including claims about regulatory compliance. On February 25, 2022, the Company and two other U.S. pharmaceutical distribution companies (collectively, "Distributors") determined that there is sufficient State and subdivision participation to proceed with an agreement to settle a substantial majority of opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Distributors by U.S. states, territories, and local governmental entities. The Company incurs and expects to continue to incur significant expense in order to resolve those and other opioids-related matters. As part of that resolution, the Company will bear a portion of the expense to establish and maintain a clearinghouse for data related to distribution of controlled substance. For more information about those litigation matters, refer to Financial Note 18, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report.

Government Contracts: Our contracts with government entities typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting, and other requirements. These statutory and regulatory requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden. We are subject to audits, investigations and oversight proceedings about our compliance with contractual and legal requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or we fail an audit, we may be subject to sanctions such as monetary damages, criminal and civil penalties, termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Federal, state and local governmental entities in the U.S. and elsewhere continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny of practices that may indicate fraud, waste, and abuse affecting government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other companies and individuals, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to statutes, regulations, and government guidance that are intended to prevent fraud and abuse. Many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and, as such, may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations at added expense. Failure to comply with these laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, could subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions, and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, or pursue government contracts.

Healthcare Regulation: In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. There are also further efforts to broaden healthcare coverage. U.S. lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices, including requiring greater price transparency, authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices for some drugs covered under the Medicare program, and drug importation measures. Provincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. Many European governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and patients by regulating pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, or reimbursement levels to control government healthcare system costs. European governments are continuously reviewing measures to support the reduction of public healthcare spending. Such measures can exert pressure on pricing frameworks and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals, which in turn may impact customer behavior. There is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood and timing of any healthcare policy reform as each E.U. country operates in a separate healthcare environment.

In December 2020, the CMS issued a final rule pertaining to “Best Price” reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Among other things, that rule may impact drug pricing and solutions to help patients afford their medications. This rule is subject to ongoing litigation. Unless the legal challenge to the rule is successful, the rule will likely become effective on January 1, 2023. There is substantial uncertainly about the likelihood, timing, and ultimate resolutions of these lawsuits.

Additionally, there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical drug supply chain in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. For example, the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (“DQSA”) requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies, such as track and trace or authentication technologies, to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. We also have record-keeping and other obligations under the E.U. Falsified Medicines Directive. Pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs.

Data Security and Privacy: We are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) we must maintain administrative, physical, and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”) and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) in Canada, and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy laws in the United States, including the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”). Some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions or otherwise limit our use of data. Many of these laws also require us to provide access or other data rights (modification, deletion, portability, etc.) to consumers’ and patients’ individual personal data records within specified periods of time. Laws such as the federal Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 may require us to provide notifications of significant data privacy breaches or cybersecurity incidents before our investigations are complete. We are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies. Failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, reputational impacts, and other costs. We also have contractual obligations that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy and data security laws. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data security laws complicate our operations and add to our costs. 

Environmental Regulation: We are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations, including those relating to radiation-emitting equipment operated at U.S. Oncology Network practices. Additionally, our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as discussed in more detail below. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products, and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program.

We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 18, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, are not material to our operations or financial position. Other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws, regulations, or government guidance in the future.

Climate Change Regulation: Governments in the U.S. and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose costs on us, including capital expenditures to develop data gathering and reporting systems. Until the timing and extent of climate-related laws are clarified, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations.

Other Information about the Business

Customers: During 2022, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 52% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 21% of our total consolidated revenues in 2022. In May 2019, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with CVS to June 2023. Our ten largest customers comprised approximately 43%, and CVS was approximately 28%, of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2022. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. 

Suppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than our largest supplier at 9% of our purchases in 2022. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in 2022 accounted for approximately 55% of our purchases.

Some of our distribution arrangements with manufacturers provide us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin.

Research and Development: Research and development expenses were $70 million, $74 million, and $96 million during 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
