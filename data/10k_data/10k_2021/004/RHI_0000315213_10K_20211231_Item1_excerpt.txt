PART I

Item 1. Business

Robert Half International Inc. (the “Company”) provides specialized staffing and risk consulting services through such divisions as Accountemps®, Robert Half® Finance & Accounting, OfficeTeam®, Robert Half® Technology, Robert Half® Management Resources, Robert Half® Legal, The Creative Group®, and Protiviti®. The Company, through its Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, and Robert Half Management Resources divisions, is a specialized provider of contract, full-time, and senior-level project professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. OfficeTeam specializes in highly skilled contract, administrative support professionals. Robert Half Technology provides project and full-time technology professionals. Robert Half Legal provides contract, project, and full-time staffing of lawyers, paralegals and legal support personnel. The Creative Group provides creative, digital, marketing, advertising and public relations professionals. Protiviti, which began operations in 2002, is a global consulting firm that helps companies solve problems in finance, technology, operations, data, analytics, governance, risk and internal audit, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

The Company’s business was originally founded in 1948. Prior to 1986, the Company was primarily a franchisor, under the names Accountemps and Robert Half (now called Robert Half Finance & Accounting), of offices providing temporary and full-time professionals in the fields of accounting and finance. Beginning in 1986, the Company and its current management embarked on a strategy of acquiring franchised locations. All of the franchises have been acquired. The Company believes that direct ownership of offices allows it to better monitor and protect the image of its trade names, promote a more consistent and higher level of quality and service throughout its network of offices and improve profitability by centralizing many of its administrative functions. Since 1986, the Company has significantly expanded operations at many of the acquired locations, opened many new locations and acquired other local or regional providers of specialized temporary service personnel. The Company has also expanded the scope of its services by launching the new product lines OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology, Robert Half Management Resources, Robert Half Legal and The Creative Group.

In 2002, the Company hired more than 700 professionals who had been affiliated with the internal audit and business and technology risk consulting practice of Arthur Andersen LLP, including more than 50 individuals who had been partners of that firm. These professionals formed the base of the Company’s Protiviti Inc. subsidiary. Protiviti has enabled the Company to enter the market for business consulting and internal audit services, and the Company believes this market offers synergies with its traditional lines of business.

Accountemps

Accountemps offers customers a reliable and economical means of dealing with uneven or peak workloads for accounting, finance, and bookkeeping personnel caused by such predictable events as vacations, taking inventories, tax work, month-end activities and special projects, and such unpredictable events as illness and emergencies. Businesses view the use of temporary employees as a means of controlling personnel costs and converting such costs from fixed to variable. The cost and inconvenience to clients of hiring and firing regular employees are eliminated by the use of Accountemps temporaries. The temporary workers are employees of Accountemps and are paid by Accountemps. The customer pays a fixed rate only for hours worked.

Accountemps clients may fill their regular employment needs by using an Accountemps employee on a trial basis and, if so desired, “converting” the temporary position to a regular position. The client typically pays a one-time fee for such conversions.

OfficeTeam

The Company’s OfficeTeam division, which commenced operations in 1991, places temporary and full-time office and administrative personnel, ranging from executive and administrative assistants to receptionists and customer service representatives. OfficeTeam operates in much the same fashion as the Accountemps division.

Robert Half Finance & Accounting

Established in 1948, the Company’s first division and specialized recruitment pioneer Robert Half Finance & Accounting specializes in the placement of full-time accounting, financial, tax and accounting operations personnel. Fees for successful placements are paid only by the employer and are generally a percentage of the new employee’s annual compensation. No fee for placement services is charged to employment candidates.

Robert Half Technology

The Company’s Robert Half Technology division, which commenced operations in 1994, specializes in providing information technology contract professionals, placing full-time employees, and offering managed services in areas ranging 

1

from multiple platform systems integration to end-user technical and desktop support, including specialists in software and application development, networking and cloud, systems integration and deployment, database design and administration, and security and business continuity.

Robert Half Legal

Since 1992, the Company has been placing temporary and full-time employees in attorney, paralegal, legal administrative and legal secretarial positions through its Robert Half Legal division. The legal profession’s requirements (the need for confidentiality, accuracy and reliability, a strong drive toward cost-effectiveness, and frequent peak caseload periods) are similar to the demands of the clients of the Accountemps division. Robert Half Legal offers a full suite of legal staffing and consulting services to help organizations manage constantly changing workloads and access expertise across in-demand legal practice areas.

Robert Half Management Resources

The Company’s Robert Half Management Resources division, which commenced operations in 1997, specializes in providing senior-level project professionals in the accounting, finance and business systems fields, including chief financial officers, controllers, senior financial analysts, internal auditors, and business systems analysts, for such tasks as financial systems conversions, business process re-engineering, business systems performance improvement and post-merger financial consolidation.

The Creative Group

The Creative Group division commenced operations in 1999 and specializes in identifying for its clients creative professionals in the areas of creative, digital, marketing, advertising and public relations. The division places contract and permanent employees in a variety of positions such as creative directors, graphic designers, web designers, media buyers, front end developers, copywriters, digital marketing managers, marketing analytics specialists, brand managers, and public relations specialists.

The Company and its subsidiaries own many trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including the Robert Half® Finance & Accounting, Accountemps®, OfficeTeam®, Robert Half® Technology, Robert Half® Management Resources, Robert Half® Legal, The Creative Group® and Protiviti® marks, which are registered in the United States and in a number of foreign countries.

Organization

Management of the Company’s staffing operations is coordinated from its headquarters facilities in Menlo Park and San Ramon, California. The Company’s headquarters provides support and centralized services to its offices in the administrative, marketing, public relations, accounting, information technology, training and legal areas, particularly as it relates to the standardization of the operating procedures of its offices. As of December 31, 2021, the Company conducted its staffing services operations through 321 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries. Office managers are responsible for most activities of their offices, including sales, local advertising and marketing and recruitment.

The day-to-day operations of Protiviti are managed by a chief executive officer and a senior management team with operational and administrative support provided by individuals located in San Ramon and Menlo Park, California. As of December 31, 2021, Protiviti had 64 offices in 24 states and 12 foreign countries.

Competition

The Company’s staffing services face competition in attracting clients as well as skilled specialized employment candidates. The staffing business is highly competitive, with a number of firms offering services similar to those provided by the Company on a national, regional or local basis. In many areas, the local companies are the strongest competitors. The most significant competitive factors in the staffing business are price and the reliability of service, both of which are often a function of the availability and quality of personnel. The expanded acceptance of remote work creates significant opportunity for the Company. It brings together the Company’s numerous strengths, including its global brand, global office network, global candidate database, and advanced AI-driven technologies and data analytics at the scale needed to excel at out-of-market recruitment and placements. This strengthens the Company’s competitive position significantly since its traditionally toughest competitors, local and regional staffing firms, generally do not have these capabilities.

Protiviti faces competition in its efforts to attract clients, expand relationships with existing clients and win new business proposals. The global professional services business is highly competitive with a dynamic regulatory environment, disruptive new technologies, security and privacy concerns, and high demand for skilled professionals all driving significant opportunities. The principal competitors of Protiviti remain the “big four” accounting firms and other consultancies. Significant competitive factors include reputation, technology, tools, project methodologies, price of services and depth of skills of personnel. Protiviti believes its competitive strengths lie in the collaborative approach it takes to working with clients, which drives knowledge transfer, understanding of client issues and value creation. This may be coupled with a “configure-to-fit” resourcing model to create blended teams of full-time Protiviti professionals and engagement professionals from Robert Half’s network of specialized talent to precisely match expertise, approach and people to the changing global needs of clients on consulting and managed solutions projects. 

Human Capital Management

Employees. The Company has approximately 14,600 full-time internal staff, including approximately 5,700 employees engaged directly in Protiviti operations. In addition, the Company placed approximately 177,000 engagement professionals on assignments with clients during 2021. In 2020, the Company had approximately 13,000 full-time internal staff, including approximately 5,000 employees engaged directly in Protiviti operations. In 2020, the Company placed approximately 150,500 engagement professionals on assignments with clients. The substantial majority of engagement professionals placed on assignment by the Company are the Company’s legal employees while they are working on assignments. The Company pays the related costs of employment, such as workers’ compensation insurance, state and federal unemployment taxes, social security and certain fringe benefits. The Company provides access to voluntary health insurance coverage to interested employees.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. The Company believes that its rich culture of diversity, equity and inclusion enables it to leverage the strengths of its workforce while also creating an environment where employees can connect, thrive and grow. In 2021, we continued our support of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge and furthered our commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion by signing joint pledges with Ascend and Disability:IN.

Current key initiatives include a companywide Diversity and Inclusion education series, the creation of Employee Network Groups (“ENGs”) as business resource groups, and a focus on external strategic partnerships to increase engagement and representation of underrepresented communities. The Company places a high value on inclusion, engaging employees in its ENG programs staffed by employees with diverse backgrounds, experiences or characteristics who share a common interest in 

3

professional development, improving corporate culture, and delivering sustained business results. In 2021, Robert Half launched the LGBTQIA+ and Global Women Employee Network Groups, joining existing groups for Black, Asian, and Hispanic/Latinx communities. Protiviti has a number of ENGs that have existed for several years. The Company uses these groups to serve as a source of inclusion and to support the acquisition of diverse talent internally and externally. Each ENG is sponsored and supported by senior leaders across the enterprise.

Across both Robert Half and Protiviti, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 55% of the Company's global workforce was female and 47% of the Company’s employees in managerial and leadership roles were female. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 33% of the Company's U.S. workforce were from underrepresented groups.

Employee Engagement. As part of the Robert Half employee voice initiative to provide its employees with feedback opportunities, in 2021, the Company conducted three surveys throughout the year to understand employee needs and support employees during the pandemic. The survey results were analyzed by an independent third-party and then reviewed by the executive officers. The results of this engagement survey were shared with individual managers, who were then tasked with taking action based on their employees’ confidential feedback (both quantitative and qualitative). In 2021, Robert Half also sent out new hire surveys at specific points in a new hire's onboarding as well as departure surveys to selected employees. By paying close attention to the results both at an aggregate enterprise level and at a department/business/workgroup level, and an employee's life cycle with Robert Half, the Company has been able to enhance its culture of rewards and recognition, drive efforts to promote inclusion and diversity, increase communication in support of employee well-being and modernize its approach to foster a culture of continuous learning and feedback. Protiviti leverages surveys in the United States and internationally, including the Great Place to Work survey.

Learning and Development. The Company emphasizes employee development and training as a priority for the organization. Training and development are key elements to the overall retention, engagement, and employee experience strategy. Our strategy is designed to empower employees to reach their full potential, and we provide a wide range of development programs, opportunities and resources needed to be successful. The Company has specialized programs for all audiences, including new hires, tenured employees and leadership. We provide a variety of learning channels including instructor-led, facilitated custom workshops, leader-led, cohort and mentorships, self-paced, e-learning and a catalog of vendor-provided courses, videos, resources, and books. The Company is committed to its employees' overall health and providing career progression by providing individual development, readiness, and transition plans as a part of its talent review and succession planning process. As a result of the pandemic, our learning strategy has pivoted to a virtual/hybrid approach. This has allowed us to expand our offerings and reach through a virtual delivery model. In 2021, we also launched a virtual-facilitated onboarding program as onboarding new employees virtually needs to be more planned, structured and engaging. As a result of the shift in our learning programs to a virtual/hybrid approach, employees have increased access and a closer connection to the Company’s learning programs. In 2021, approximately 10,432 employees engaged with the Company’s learning program virtually.

Compensation, Benefits and Well-being. The Company offers fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support its employees’ overall well-being. To ensure alignment with management's short- and long-term objectives, the Company's compensation programs for all employees include competitive base pay and short-term and long-term incentives for some of its employees. The Company offers a wide array of benefits including comprehensive health and welfare insurance, generous time-off and leave, and retirement and financial support. The Company provides emotional well-being services through its Employee Assistance Program as well as a number of perks and other convenience benefits.

In response to the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, the enterprise implemented significant changes. We provided all employees with the unconditional opportunity to work from home and the vast majority did so. We also implemented additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. The Company also ensured employees received unlimited paid time off to care for themselves or their families who were impacted by COVID-19, whether due to illness, quarantine, or lack of childcare resources.
