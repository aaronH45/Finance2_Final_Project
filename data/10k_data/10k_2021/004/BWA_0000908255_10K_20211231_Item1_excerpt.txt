No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated net sales in any of the years presented. Sales to the Company’s top ten customers represented 57% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2021.

The Company’s automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.

Sales and Marketing

Each of the Company’s businesses within its reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of the Company’s businesses are assigned to serve specific customers for one or more businesses’ products. Account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with customers’ purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business. Because of their close relationship with customers, account executives are able to identify and meet customers’ needs based upon their knowledge of the Company’s product design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers. In addition, sales and marketing employees of the Company’s reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities where appropriate. 

Seasonality

The Company’s operations are directly related to the automotive and commercial-vehicle industry. Consequently, the Company’s segments may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the Company’s third quarter.

Research and Development

The Company conducts advanced propulsion research. This advanced engineering function seeks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new propulsion systems and modules that can be commercialized. This function oversees the Company's investments in certain venture capital funds that provide seed money for start-up businesses developing new technologies pertinent to the automotive industry and the Company's propulsion strategies.
