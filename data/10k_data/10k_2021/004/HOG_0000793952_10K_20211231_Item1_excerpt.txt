Item 1. Business

General

Harley-Davidson Motor Company was founded in 1903. Harley-Davidson, Inc. was incorporated in 1981, at which time it purchased the Harley-Davidson® motorcycle business from AMF Incorporated in a management buyout. In 1986, Harley-Davidson, Inc. became publicly held. Harley-Davidson, Inc. is the parent company of the group of companies referred to as Harley-Davidson Motor Company and Harley-Davidson Financial Services. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the “Company” include Harley-Davidson, Inc. and all of its subsidiaries. The Company operates in two segments: Motorcycles and Related Products (Motorcycles) and Financial Services. The Company's reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services and are managed separately based on the fundamental differences in their operations.

Strategy(1) 

During 2020, the Company executed a set of actions, referred to as The Rewire. The Rewire was a critical overhaul of the Company's business to set the Company on a new course and to provide a solid foundation to execute its 2021-2025 strategic plan, The Hardwire. 

The Hardwire is the Company's 2021-2025 strategic plan guided by its mission and vision, which the Company introduced on February 2, 2021. The plan targets long-term profitable growth through focused efforts that extend and strengthen the brand and drive value for its shareholders. The Company's ambition is to enhance its position as the most desirable motorcycle brand in the world. Desirability is a motivating force driven by emotion. Harley-Davidson has long been associated with igniting desirability, and it is embedded in its vision; it is at the heart of its mission and it is part of its 118-year legacy. To drive desirability, the Company will: 

•Design, engineer and advance the most desirable motorcycles in the world - reflected in quality, innovation, and craftsmanship

•Build a lifestyle brand valued for the emotion reflected in every product and experience for riders and non-riders alike

•Focus on customers, delivering adventure and freedom for the soul 

The Hardwire strategic priorities are as follows:

Profit focus: Investing in its strongest motorcycle product segments – Harley-Davidson plans to invest significant time and resources on strengthening and growing its leadership positions in its strongest, most profitable motorcycle product segments: Grand American Touring, large Cruiser and Trike. 

Selective expansion and redefinition: To win in attractive motorcycle segments and markets – The Company plans to selectively expand into and within motorcycle segments, focusing on product segments that are profitable and aligned with the Company's product and brand capabilities, such as Adventure Touring and middleweight Cruiser. 

3

The Company plans to focus on approximately 50 global markets that matter most to its future growth. This includes the following priority markets: United States, DACH (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), Japan, China, Canada, France, United Kingdom, Italy, Australia, and New Zealand. The Company will also continue to test further avenues for desirable long-term growth such as premium low-displacement motorcycles. 

Lead in Electric: Investing in leading the electric motorcycle market – Electric motorcycles are important to the Company's future and it is committed to and passionate about leading the electric motorcycle market. The focus will be on technology development, with an approach to product and go-to-market actions that reflect the expectations of the targeted customer to deliver the most desirable electric motorcycles in the world. Refer to the LiveWire Transaction discussion included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report for more information regarding recent actions the Company has taken to lead in electric.

Growth beyond bikes: Expanding complementary businesses and engaging beyond product – Harley-Davidson creates products, services and experiences that inspire its customers to discover adventure, find freedom for the soul and live the Harley-Davidson lifestyle. The Company's parts and accessories, apparel and licensing, and Financial Services businesses are all important pillars of the Company's future success as a global lifestyle brand. Through The Hardwire, the Company plans to grow the profitability of these businesses through refreshed product and program offerings, stronger execution and additional opportunities, including digital and in-dealership purchases. 

Customer experience: Growing our connection with riders and non-riders – The Hardwire puts customers at the forefront of the Company's products, experiences and investments – from the rider who may dream of motorcycling or just learned to ride, all the way to riders who are deeply passionate about and invested in the Harley-Davidson lifestyle. The Company recognizes the different needs and expectations of its customers and is creating touchpoints tailored to individual needs. Powered by integrated data, the goal is to seamlessly engage with customers, creating a meaningful, unique and personalized experience with Harley-Davidson each and every time. 

Inclusive Stakeholder Management: Prioritizing people, planet and profit – The Company strives to deliver long-term value to all stakeholders – people (employees, dealers, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and communities), planet, and profit. Inclusive Stakeholder Management is the unifying theme for how the Company will help drive additional shareholder value for its investors.

In early 2021, the Company provided financial targets for its 2021-2025 strategic plan. The Company is in the process of updating these targets based on 2021 financial results and progress made on The Hardwire strategic priorities to date. The Company expects to provide updated long-term financial targets in the second quarter of 2022.(1)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2021, the Company opened its first Company-owned retail dealership in the U.S. which exclusively sells LiveWire electric motorcycles through both in-store and eCommerce channels. All other dealerships included in the table above are independently owned.

The Company also distributes its motorcycles through an independent distributor in India. The independent distributor sells the Company's products through independent Harley-Davidson dealers, included in the table above, as well as their existing dealer network.

Motorcycles segment revenue by product line as a percent of total revenue for the last three fiscal years was as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Motorcycles – The Company offers internal combustion engine motorcycles, under the Harley-Davidson brand, and electric powered motorcycles under the LiveWire brand. The Company established LiveWire as a separate brand in mid-2021. Prior to that, the Company offered electric motorcycles under the Harley-Davidson brand since their introduction in 2019. The Company's internal combustion engines generally have displacements that are greater than 600 cubic centimeters (cc), up to a maximum displacement of approximately 1900cc. The Company's electric motorcycles have an electric powered motor with a kilowatt (kW) peak power equivalent to greater than 600cc. The Company markets its motorcycles in six categories that reflect customer needs and preferences and the Company's unique combination of product heritage and innovation. The Company's product categories include: Grand American Touring, Trike, Adventure Touring, Cruiser, Sport and Electric. The motorcycle industry uses the following motorcycle product segments:

•Touring – emphasizes rider comfort and load capacity and incorporates features such as fairings and luggage compartments ideal for long rides, including the Company's Grand American Touring and Trike models

•Dual – designed with the capability for use on-road as well as for some off-road recreational use, including the Company's Adventure Touring models

•Cruiser – emphasizes styling, customization and casual riding including the Company's Cruiser, Sport and Electric models

•Standard – a basic motorcycle typically featuring upright seating for one or two passengers

•Sportbike – incorporates racing technology and performance and aerodynamic styling and riding position

Competition in the motorcycle industry is based upon a number of factors including product capabilities and features, styling, price, quality, reliability, warranty, availability of financing, and quality of the dealer networks that sell the products. The Company believes its motorcycles continue to generally command a premium price at retail relative to competitors’ motorcycles. Harley-Davidson motorcycles offer unique styling, customization, innovative design, distinctive sound, superior quality and reliability and include a warranty. The Company also considers the availability of its line of motorcycle parts and accessories and apparel, the availability of financing through Harley-Davidson Financial Services and its global network of dealers to be competitive advantages.

Industry data includes on-road motorcycles with internal combustion engines with displacements greater than 600cc and electric motorcycles with kW peak power equivalents greater than 600cc (601+cc). In 2021, approximately 81% of the total annual dealer retail sales of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles were sold in the U.S. and European 601+cc markets. Other significant markets for the Company, based on the Company's 2021 retail sales data, include Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and China.

Industry retail registration data(a)(b) for 601+cc motorcycles was as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Data includes on-road models with internal combustion engines with displacements greater than 600cc's and electric motorcycles with kilowatt (kW) peak power equivalents greater than 600cc's (601+cc). On-road 601+cc models include dual purpose models, three-wheeled motorcycles and autocycles. Registration data for Harley-Davidson Street® 500 motorcycles is not included in this table.

(b)The retail registration data for Harley-Davidson motorcycles presented in this table will differ from the Harley-Davidson retail sales data presented in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Item 7). The Company’s source for retail sales data in Item 7 is sales and warranty registrations provided by dealers as compiled by the Company. The retail sales data in Item 7 includes sales of Harley-Davidson Street® 500 motorcycles which are excluded from this table. In addition, small differences may arise related to the timing of data submissions to the independent sources.

(c)U.S. industry data is derived from information provided by the Motorcycle Industry Council. This third-party data is subject to revision and update. 

(d)Europe data includes Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. Industry data is derived from information provided by Management Services Helwig Schmitt GmbH. This third-party data is subject to revision and update.

Parts and Accessories – Parts and accessories products are comprised of Genuine Motor Parts and Genuine Motor Accessories. Genuine Motor Parts include replacement parts and Genuine Motor Accessories includes mechanical and cosmetic accessories. 

Apparel and Licensing – Apparel, formerly referred to as General Merchandise, includes clothing and riding gear including Genuine MotorClothes®. In addition, the Company creates reach and awareness of the Harley-Davidson brand among its customers and the non-riding public by licensing the name “Harley-Davidson” and other trademarks owned by the Company for use on a range of products. 

Patents and Trademarks – The Company strategically manages its portfolio of patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property.

The Company owns, and continues to obtain, patent rights that relate to its motorcycles and related products and processes for their production. Certain technology-related intellectual property is also protected, where appropriate, by license agreements, confidentiality agreements or other agreements with suppliers, employees and other third parties. The Company diligently protects its intellectual property, including patents and trade secrets, and its rights to innovative and proprietary technologies and designs. This protection, including enforcement, is important as the Company moves forward with investments in new products, designs and technologies. While the Company believes patents are important to its business operations and in the aggregate constitute a valuable asset, the success of the business is not dependent on any one patent or group of patents. The Company’s active patent portfolio has an average remaining age of approximately six years. A patent review committee manages the patent strategy and portfolio of the Company.

Trademarks are important to the Company’s motorcycle and related products businesses and licensing activities. The Company has a vigorous worldwide program of trademark registration and enforcement to maintain and strengthen the value of the trademarks and prevent the unauthorized use of those trademarks. The HARLEY-DAVIDSON trademark and the Bar and Shield trademark are each highly recognizable to the public and are very valuable assets. Additionally, the Company uses numerous other trademarks, trade names and logos which are registered worldwide. The following are among the Company’s trademarks: HARLEY-DAVIDSON, H-D, HARLEY, the Bar & Shield Logo, MOTORCLOTHES, the MotorClothes Logo, the #1 Logo, the Willie G Skull Logo, HARLEY OWNERS GROUP, H.O.G., the H.O.G. Logo, LIVEWIRE, SOFTAIL and SPORTSTER. The HARLEY-DAVIDSON trademark has been used since 1903 and the Bar and Shield trademark since at least 1910. Substantially all of the 

6

Company’s trademarks are owned by H-D U.S.A., LLC, a subsidiary of the Company, which also manages the Company’s global trademark strategy and portfolio.

Marketing – The Company’s brand, products and the riding experience are marketed to consumers worldwide. Marketing occurs primarily through digital and experiential activities as well as through more traditional promotional and advertising activities. Additionally, the Company’s dealers engage in a wide range of local marketing and events.

Experiences that build community and connect consumers with the Harley-Davidson brand and with one another have traditionally been at the center of much of the Company’s marketing efforts. To develop, engage and retain committed riders, the Company participates in and sponsors motorcycle rallies, racing activities, music festivals and other special events. This includes events sponsored by the Harley Owners Group (H.O.G.®) to build community and connect Harley-Davidson motorcycle riders around the world. These activities help inspire interest in riding, foster motorcycle culture and build a passionate community of Harley-Davidson riders. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company's ability to participate in and sponsor certain events. The Company has resumed activities; however, it continues to modify the experience to remain compliant with COVID-19 protocols. 

Seasonality – The seasonality of the Company’s wholesale motorcycle shipments generally correlates with the timing of retail sales made by dealers. Retail sales generally track closely with regional riding seasons. In addition, during 2020, wholesale shipments and retail sales were impacted by the Company's decision to reset, beginning in 2020, the timing of its annual new model year introduction from the third quarter to the first quarter. As a result of this change, initial shipments of new model year 2021 motorcycles did not occur until the first quarter of 2021. 

Motorcycle Manufacturing – The majority of the Company's manufacturing processes are performed at facilities located in the U.S. The Company's U.S. manufacturing facilities supply the U.S. market as well as certain international markets. Additionally, the Company operates facilities in Thailand and Brazil. The Company's Thailand facility manufactures motorcycles for certain Asian and European markets. In Brazil, the Company operates a facility that assembles motorcycles from component kits sourced from the Company’s U.S. facilities and suppliers. The Company's global manufacturing operations are focused on driving world-class quality and performance. A global manufacturing footprint enables the Company to be close to customers, provide quality products at a competitive price and grow its overall business. 

Raw Materials and Purchased Components – The Company continues to establish and reinforce long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with its suppliers. Through these collaborative relationships, the Company gains access to technical and commercial resources for application directly to product design, development and manufacturing initiatives. In addition, through a continued focus on collaboration and strong supplier relationships, the Company believes it will be positioned to achieve its strategic objectives and deliver cost and quality improvements over the long-term.(1)

The Company's principal raw materials include steel and aluminum castings, forgings, steel sheet and bar. The Company also purchases certain motorcycle components including, but not limited to, electronic fuel injection systems, batteries, tires, seats, electrical components, instruments and wheels. The Company closely monitors the overall viability of its supply base. The Company is proactively working with its suppliers in an effort to minimize disruptions resulting from supply chain challenges. This includes managing through the impact of the current global shortage of semiconductor chips. During 2021, these challenges resulted in increased costs and disruptions in the availability of certain raw materials and purchased components, which in turn impacted the Company's production, shipments and revenues.

Regulation – International, federal, state and local authorities have various environmental control requirements relating to air, water and noise that affect the business and operations of the Company. The Company strives to ensure that its facilities and products comply with all applicable environmental regulations and standards.

The Company’s motorcycles and certain other products that are sold in the U.S. are subject to certification by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for compliance with applicable emissions and noise standards. Certain Harley-Davidson products are designed to comply with EPA and CARB standards and the Company believes it will comply with future requirements when they go into effect.(1) Additionally, certain of the Company’s products must comply with the motorcycle emissions, noise and safety standards of Canada, the European Union, Japan, Brazil and certain other foreign markets where they are sold, and the Company believes its products currently comply with those standards. As the Company expects environmental standards to become more stringent over time, the Company will continue to incur research, development and production costs in this area for the foreseeable future.(1)

7

The Company, as a manufacturer of motorcycle products, is subject to the U.S. National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which is administered by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Company has certified to NHTSA that certain of its motorcycle products comply fully with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and related regulations. The Company has from time to time initiated certain voluntary recalls. During the three years ending in 2021, the Company accrued $5.5 million associated with 9 voluntary recalls.

Financial Services Segment

The Financial Services segment consists of the activities of Harley-Davidson Financial Services which is engaged in the business of financing and servicing wholesale inventory receivables and retail consumer loans, primarily for the purchase of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley-Davidson Financial Services also works with certain unaffiliated insurance companies to provide motorcycle insurance and protection products to motorcycle owners. Harley-Davidson Financial Services conducts business principally in the U.S. and Canada. The Company’s dealers and their retail customers in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America generally have access to financing through third-party financial institutions, some of which have licensing agreements with Harley-Davidson Financial Services.

Wholesale Financial Services – Harley-Davidson Financial Services provides wholesale financial services to the Company's U.S. and Canadian independent dealers, including floorplan and open account financing of motorcycles and parts and accessories. All the Company's U.S. and Canadian independent dealers utilized Harley-Davidson Financial Services financing programs at some point during 2021.

Retail Financial Services – Harley-Davidson Financial Services provides retail financing to consumers, consisting primarily of installment lending for the purchase of new and used Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Harley-Davidson Financial Services’ retail financial services are available through most of the Company's dealerships in the U.S. and Canada.

Insurance Services – Harley-Davidson Financial Services works with certain unaffiliated insurance companies which offer point-of-sale protection products through most of the Company's dealers in the U.S. and Canada, including motorcycle insurance, extended service contracts and motorcycle maintenance protection. Harley-Davidson Financial Services also direct-markets motorcycle insurance and extended service contracts to owners of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In addition, Harley-Davidson Financial Services markets a comprehensive package of business insurance coverages and services to owners of the Company's dealerships.

Licensing – Harley-Davidson Financial Services has licensing arrangements with third-party financial institutions that issue credit cards bearing the Harley-Davidson brand in the U.S. and certain international markets. Internationally, Harley-Davidson Financial Services licenses the Harley-Davidson brand to local third-party financial institutions that offer products to the Company’s retail customers such as financing and insurance. 

Funding – The Company believes a diversified and cost-effective funding strategy is important to meet Harley-Davidson Financial Services’ goal of providing credit while delivering appropriate returns and profitability. Financial Services operations in 2021 were funded with unsecured debt, unsecured commercial paper, asset-backed commercial paper conduit facilities, committed unsecured bank facilities, asset-backed securitizations and brokered certificates of deposit that Harley-Davidson Financial Services offers to customers indirectly through contractual arrangements with third-party banks and/or securities brokerage firms through its bank subsidiary. 

Competition – The Company regards its ability to offer a package of wholesale and retail financial services in the U.S. and Canada as a significant competitive advantage. Competitors in the financial services industry compete for business based largely on price and, to a lesser extent, service. Harley-Davidson Financial Services competes on convenience, service, brand association, dealer relations, industry experience, terms, and price.

In the U.S. and Canada, Harley-Davidson Financial Services financed 64.8% and 33.3% of new Harley-Davidson motorcycles retailed by dealers during 2021, respectively, compared to 67.6% and 42.2%, respectively, during 2020. Competitors for retail motorcycle finance business are primarily banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. In the motorcycle insurance business, competition primarily comes from national insurance companies and from insurance agencies serving local or regional markets. For insurance-related products such as extended service contracts, Harley-Davidson Financial Services faces competition from certain regional and national industry participants as well as dealer in-house programs. Competition for the wholesale motorcycle finance business primarily consists of banks and other financial institutions providing wholesale financing to dealers in their local markets.

Trademarks – Harley-Davidson Financial Services uses various trademarks and trade names for its financial services and products, which are licensed from H-D U.S.A., LLC, including HARLEY-DAVIDSON, H-D and the Bar & Shield Logo.

8

Seasonality – Harley-Davidson Financial Services experiences seasonal variations in retail financing activities based on the timing of regional riding seasons in the U.S. and Canada. In general, from mid-March through August, retail financing volume is greatest. Harley-Davidson Financial Services wholesale financing volume is affected by inventory levels at dealers. Dealers generally have higher inventory in the first half of the year. As a result, outstanding wholesale finance receivables are generally higher during the same period. 

Regulation – Harley-Davidson Financial Services operations are generally subject to supervision and regulation by federal and state administrative agencies and various foreign governmental authorities. Many of the requirements imposed by such entities are in place to provide consumer protection as it pertains to the selling and servicing of financial products and services. Therefore, Harley-Davidson Financial Services operations may be subject to limitations imposed by regulations, laws and judicial and/or administrative decisions. In the U.S., for example, applicable laws include the federal Truth-in-Lending Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act.

Depending on the specific facts and circumstances involved, non-compliance with these laws may limit the ability of Harley-Davidson Financial Services to collect all or part of the principal or interest on applicable loans, entitling the borrower to rescind the loan or to obtain a refund of amounts previously paid, or could subject Harley-Davidson Financial Services to the payment of damages or penalties and administrative sanctions, including “cease and desist” orders, and could limit the number of loans eligible for Harley-Davidson Financial Services' securitization programs.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act granted the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the Bureau) significant supervisory, enforcement and rule-making authority in the area of consumer financial products and services. Certain actions and regulations of the Bureau will directly impact Harley-Davidson Financial Services and its operations. For example, the Bureau has supervisory authority over non-bank larger participants in the vehicle financing market, which includes a non-bank subsidiary of Harley-Davidson Financial Services.

Such regulatory requirements and associated supervision also could limit the discretion of Harley-Davidson Financial Services in operating its business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of any charter, license or registration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines, criminal penalties and administrative sanctions.

Eaglemark Savings Bank (ESB), a subsidiary of Harley-Davidson Financial Services, is a Nevada state thrift chartered as an Industrial Loan Company. The activities of ESB are governed by federal laws and regulations and State of Nevada banking laws. ESB is subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Nevada state bank examiners. ESB originates retail loans, retains certain of those loans and sells the remaining loans to a non-banking subsidiary of Harley-Davidson Financial Services. This process allows Harley-Davidson Financial Services to offer retail products with many common characteristics across the U.S. and to similarly service loans to U.S. retail customers.

Human Capital Management

Workforce Composition – As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s global workforce was comprised of approximately 5,800 employees, including approximately 5,200 and 600 employees within the Motorcycles and Financial Services segments, respectively. Of all employees, 86.5% are based in the U.S., 54.4% are salaried, and 41.4%, or approximately 2,400 hourly unionized employees at the Company's U.S. manufacturing facilities, are represented as follows with collective bargaining agreements:

Based on employee-provided identity information, 71.8% of the Company’s global workforce was male and 78.4% of the U.S. workforce was white at the end of 2021. The following table provides gender and race/ethnicity information for the Company's employees at the end of the last two years and for new hires during those years. The information is presented for both the total workforce and for the management and above portion of the Company's workforce. The gender identity information is for the global workforce and the race/ethnicity information is for the U.S. workforce.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

One of the measures under the Company's 2021 executive leadership long-term incentive awards was to achieve greater than or equal to a 38% diverse representation for the Manager and above salaried workforce from a baseline of 35.8%, using a methodology where each attribute is measured (e.g., a diverse female Manager is one person with two attributes). Applying this same methodology, as of December 31, 2021, 39.3% of the Manager and above workforce was female (global) or diverse (U.S. non-white). The table above measures only one attribute per person.

Employee Wellbeing – Inclusive Stakeholder Management is one of six key priorities under The Hardwire, and the Company believes that the success of The Hardwire will be realized through the engagement and empowerment of its employees. The Company's overall employee wellbeing objectives are to develop an inclusive and diverse workforce and establish progressive work environments, policies, and practices. Progress against those objectives in 2021 included:

•In February 2021, the Company extended employee ownership to all employees by making an equity grant to approximately 4,500 employees not otherwise eligible for equity grants, including hourly production workers.

•In July 2021, the Company issued a global Workplace Ecosystem Policy reflecting a shift to a more flexible workplace environment for employees with the establishment of On-Campus, Hybrid, Remote and Field role categories. Most of the Company's salaried workforce is categorized as Hybrid. The Workplace Ecosystem Policy provides flexibility for individual work hours and “days in office” are not mandated.

•In September 2021, the Company announced to all U.S. employees the availability of free, confidential financial education and one-on-one support through a partnership with Operation HOPE, a non-profit, for purpose organization dedicated to financial dignity and inclusion. 

•In October 2021, the Company explained to employees its revamped Total Rewards approach, which includes incentive plans, health care and employee assistance program (EAP) benefits, tuition reimbursement and compensation. As it relates to compensation, the Company announced an upward adjustment in compensation rates (salary and hourly) effective January 1, 2022, added an impact increase mechanism, and clarified the process for awarding spot bonuses. The Company's revamped Total Rewards approach also provides more transparency regarding annual market evaluations of employment positions (through a global compensation survey) and the Company's biennial equity evaluation (conducted with an external third party), both of which may result in individual compensation adjustments.

•The Company continued its strong health and safety performance through 2021, ending the year with a 0.4 recordable rate, 0.4 restricted time (DART) rate and 0.2 lost time (DAFWII) rate for the Company.

•With respect to training and development, during the fourth quarter of 2021 the Company launched a new employee experience that involved approximately 290 new employees learning about the Company and connecting with others, including leaders. The Company also launched a manager development program to help new managers understand their roles and responsibilities as new leaders and continued its development program for leaders with an additional nine 

10

topics of discussion and best practices sharing; approximately 50 people leaders engaged in the Company's “Leading H-D#1 Academy” and approximately 1,200 people leaders followed the Company's talent development toolkit pathway as of December 31, 2021. Overall, the number of active users in the Company's online learning platform increased 21%, to approximately 2,900 active users, in 2021.

•In addition, the Company had four employees participate in a new leadership development program sponsored by the African American Chamber of Commerce Wisconsin and 25 employees in total participated in two different cohorts of the YWCA Southeast Wisconsin’s Conversations on Race program, including employees from outside Wisconsin.

Climate Change 

As a producer of heavyweight gasoline-powered motorcycles, the Company recognizes the impact its products and their production have on the environment. The Company continues to strive to reduce its environmental impact across all aspects of its business and has committed to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Company aims to have interim targets to get to net zero carbon emissions set by the end of 2022 that are based on the principles of the Science Based Targets initiative to keep the earth’s temperature rise below 1.5°C and the benefits of high-quality carbon credits focused on nature and biodiversity conservation. The Company is focusing on the following areas as it defines its path to achieving net zero carbon emissions: (1) improving fuel economy and reducing emissions for combustion products; (2) working with its suppliers and through the upstream tiers to reduce the impacts of the entire supply chain; (3) using less energy and an increased mix of renewable energy in its factories and offices (and encouraging efforts for energy producers to be carbon neutral); (4) advancing and leading the industry in electric motorcycles; and (5) defining its approach to the use of carbon credits and offsets with a focus on supporting sustainable developments and resiliency. Regulatory developments, global climate changes and consumer preferences will impact the Company’s interim targets.

In addition, climate change-related legislation and regulation could impact the Company and the actions it takes to respond to climate change concerns. The motorcycle industry is already subject to regulations worldwide that govern product characteristics and that differ by region, country, state or province and locality. Regulations continue to be proposed to address concerns regarding the environment, including global climate change and its impact. The precise implications of those actions, as well as future efforts, are uncertain.
