Markets, Sales and Distribution

The Company believes that the market for its products will grow over the long-term based on the following factors:

•Increasing worldwide population, including a shift towards aging demographics, which will require greater dental care.

•Natural teeth are being retained longer - individuals with natural teeth are much more likely to visit a dentist than those without any natural teeth.

•Increasing demand for aesthetic dentistry and the appeal of clear aligners as an orthodontic treatment.

•Continued opportunities in emerging markets related to the rise in discretionary incomes making dental services an increasing priority.

5

•Increasing demand for single visit dentistry versus historical multi-visit procedure requirements, and for higher quality of patient care in terms of comfort and ease of product use and handling.

•Increasing demand for earlier preventive care - dentistry has evolved from a profession primarily dealing with pain, infections, and tooth decay to one with increased emphasis on earlier diagnosis, preventive care, and the role oral health plays in overall health.

•Increasing demand for more efficiency and better workflow in the dental office, including digital and integrated solutions such as the enhanced power of diagnostic equipment through 3D imaging. The rapid pace of digital technology adoption including the digitization of clinical workflows is becoming a category standard versus traditional manual processes.

•The Company’s business is less susceptible than many other industries to general downturns in the economies in which it operates. 

•The Company is well positioned to meet macroeconomic challenges and execute on a strategy of delivering value through digital workflows due to its leading market offerings in all key areas of dental procedures (implants, endodontic, restorative and aligners) as well as digital infrastructure (CAD/CAM and imaging) utilized in dental practices around the globe.

Dentsply Sirona employs approximately 5,000 highly-trained, product-specific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing, and services tailored to the sales and technical support requirements of its distributors, dealers and end-users.

Sales and Distribution

Dentsply Sirona distributes approximately two-thirds of its dental consumable and technology and equipment products through third-party distributors. Certain highly technical products such as dental technology equipment, dental ceramics, crown and bridge porcelain products, endodontic instruments and materials, orthodontic clear aligners and appliances, and dental implants are often sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets. Additionally, the Company’s Byte business produces aligners which are sold direct to consumers under doctor-directed, personalized treatment plans. 

For the year ended December 31, 2021, no customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales or consolidated accounts receivable balance. Customers that accounted for 10% or more of net sales and accounts receivable for the years ended December 31 were as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Although a significant portion of the Company's sales are made to distributors, dealers and importers, Dentsply Sirona focuses much of its marketing efforts on the dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, dental laboratories and dental schools which are the end-users of its products. As part of this end-user “pull through” marketing approach, the Company conducts extensive distributor, dealer and end-user marketing programs. Additionally, the Company trains laboratory technicians, dental hygienists, dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world. The Company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field.

Operating Principles

The Company's focus includes the creation of more meaningful solutions for dentists built around the following five key operating principles: 

•Approach customers as one: Put the customer at the center of how Dentsply Sirona is organized. The Company has an integrated approach to customer service, direct and indirect selling, and clinical education to strengthen the relationship with the customer and better serve the customers' needs.

6

•Create innovative solutions that customers love to use: A comprehensive R&D program that prioritizes strategic spending building the next generation of digital workflow technologies and service offerings, resulting in more impactful innovations each year.

•Think and act with positive intent and the highest integrity: Execute the business in a way that empowers our people, respects the communities in which we do business, and establishes trust with our partners and stakeholders.

•Operate sustainably in everything the Company does: Take a thoughtful, proactive approach to creating a sustainable company through investments in our employees, customers, and the environment.

•Use size and global breadth to our advantage: The Company is focused on integrating its dental product portfolios to unlock operational efficiencies, including performance improvements in procurement, logistics, manufacturing, sales force and marketing programs; and at the same time simplifying the business on a worldwide scale. In combination, these initiatives will improve organizational efficiency and better leverage the Company’s selling, general and administrative infrastructure.

Product Development

While the Company enjoys market leadership in several of its product categories, continuous innovation and product development are critical for it to continue to grow its share of the dental markets it serves. Many of Dentsply Sirona’s existing products are undergoing brand extensions, and the Company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that have a more significant impact on how dental and clinical professionals treat their patients. During 2021 the Company continued to prioritize investments supporting digitally enhanced workflows through each stage of patient care, including imaging and scanning technologies used in diagnosis, treatment planning software, and customized products to deliver treatment. The Company’s position as an integrated global business allows for the rapid deployment of these innovations throughout the markets it serves to achieve rapid globalization and economies of scale. New products introduced within the past three years accounted for approximately 24% of 2021 sales. 

New advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in digital dentistry, including both equipment and consumables. Through investments in research and development, the Company has accelerated multiple new product development initiatives during the year, such as the rollout of software upgrades for CEREC; the user interface for SureSmile aligners; introduction of PrimeTaper, a self-tapping implant with a tapered design; and ProTaper Ultimate, the next generation of endodontic files. During 2020, the Company introduced Axeos, a new digital imaging product with a 3D wide field of view. During 2021, the Company acquired key supporting technologies in OSSIX bone regenerative collagen through the purchase of Datum Dental, and the new VPro aligner treatment devices through the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Propel Orthodontics LLC ("Propel"). 

R&D investments include activities to accelerate product and clinical innovation and develop potential improvements to the manufacturing process. These investments also support engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement for current and next-generation products, with an objective to achieve more frequent development and release cycles. The Company also undertakes pre-commercialization trials and testing of technological improvements prior to inception of the manufacturing process. As is true across its other functions, the Company is continually transforming how R&D is conducted by identifying best practices, driving efficiencies, and optimizing cost structure to enable a more effective development process and faster concept-to-market timelines. The Company is undergoing a strategic shift away from a budget dedicated to specific products and deliverables to a focus on strategic market areas with more agile funding. Focused, cross-functional teams are being increasingly utilized to offer innovative products efficiently, to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant technologies and to maximize cost and time savings as they are brought into production.

In addition to internal product development, the Company also pursues external research and development opportunities, including acquisitions, licensing, or other arrangements with third parties. Initiatives to support technological development also include collaborations with research institutions and dental and medical schools. The Company annually supports the achievements of dental students conducting innovative research through its 2021 Student Competition for Advancing Dental Research and its Application Awards (SCADA) program. The Company is also committed to participation in clinical research demonstrating the efficacy of our products prior to market introduction, for example the success of the implant registry site utilized for research involvement in conjunction with the PrimeTaper launch. During 2021, the Company announced that it was opening a 70,000-square-foot innovation center close to its corporate office, which will house key functions such as 3D printing and complement its other flagship innovation centers in Germany and Sweden. Through these internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions, dental and medical schools, the Company directly invests in the development of new products, improvement of existing products and advances in technology. These investments include an emphasis on research in digital data sharing technology, including the incorporation of long-term artificial intelligence and machine learning. The continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the Company’s strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry. The Company’s long-term plans for investment in product development include an objective to maintain a level of research and development spend that is at least 4% of annual net sales with a focus on innovation and expansion of digital, software, services, and other platform offerings.

Acquisition Activities

Dentsply Sirona believes that the dental technology and consumable products industries continue to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution, although they remain fragmented thereby creating a number of acquisition opportunities.

The Company views acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy. These acquisition activities are intended to supplement the Company’s organic growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business to capitalize on significant growth drivers, including new technologies, additional products, organizational strength and geographic breadth. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company continued this trend, beginning with the first quarter purchase of Datum Dental, Ltd., a producer and distributor of specialized regenerative dental material based in Israel, which provided the Company with a key technology to serve the Implants markets. The Company followed in the second quarter with the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Propel, a domestic company which manufactures and sells orthodontic devices and provides in-office and at-home orthodontic accessory devices, an investment which is expected to further accelerate the growth and profitability of the Company's combined clear aligners business. In the third quarter, the Company completed its acquisition of a partially owned affiliate based in Switzerland that primarily develops highly specialized software, which is expected to further accelerate the development of the Company's specialized software related to CAD/CAM systems. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company made various investments, including the acquisition of Byte, a direct-to-consumer clear aligners business, which complements the Company's existing clear aligner product by adding a digital component and is expected to enhance scale and accelerate the growth and profitability of the Company's combined clear aligners business going forward. This acquisition is representative of the Company's strategy of matching technological advancement in digital dentistry with innovative marketing and delivery in order to reach areas of high-growth potential for customer demand. For more information regarding the Company's acquisition activity, refer to Note 6, Business Combinations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Operating and Technical Expertise

Dentsply Sirona believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success. The manufacturing processes of the Company’s products require substantial and varied technical expertise.

Competition

The Company conducts its operations, both domestic and foreign, under highly competitive market conditions. Competition in the dental and healthcare consumable products and dental technology and equipment products industries is based primarily upon product performance, quality, safety and ease of use, as well as price, customer service, innovation and acceptance by clinicians, technicians and patients. Dentsply Sirona believes that its principal strengths include its well-established brand names, its reputation for high quality and innovative products, its leadership in product development and manufacturing, its global sales force, the breadth of its product line and distribution network, its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the Company’s products by dental and medical professionals.

Regulation 

The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the Company’s products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the United States. The following sections describe certain, but not all, of the significant regulations that apply to the Company. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that the Company is subject to, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.

 The majority of the Company’s products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (“MDD”) (1993) in the European Union, which will be updated to the European Union Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) in 2021 (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder) and similar international laws and regulations. The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Certain medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.

Dental and medical devices of the types sold by Dentsply Sirona are generally classified by the FDA into a category that renders them subject to the same controls that apply to all medical devices, including regulations regarding alteration, misbranding, notification, record-keeping and good manufacturing practices. In the European Union, Dentsply Sirona’s products are subject to the medical device laws of the various member states, which are based on a Directive of the European Commission. Such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations. Dentsply Sirona products in Europe bear the CE mark showing that such products comply with European regulations. The Company’s products that fall in category of Class I as classified by EU Medical Device Directive were mandated to be certified under the new European Union Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”). These regulations also applied to all medical device manufacturers who market their medical devices in the EU and all such manufacturers had to perform significant upgrades to quality systems and processes including technical documentation and subject them to new certification under MDR in order to continue to sell those products in the European Union (“EU”). Although all medical device manufacturers were required to certify their Class I products by May 2021, the EU MDR regulations for additional Classes of medical devices is mandated to be fully enforceable by May 2024. This also includes completion of certified quality management systems to manufacturers quality management systems. Dentsply Sirona remains focused on ensuring that all its products that are considered to be medical device will be fully certified as required by the EU MDR dates and timelines. 

The Company is also subject to domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders regarding anti-bribery and anti-corruption, including, but not limited to, the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.S. Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the United Kingdom’s Bribery Act 2010 (c.23), Brazil’s Clean Company Act 2014 (Law No. 12,846) China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission (“NHFPC”) circulars No. 40 and No. 50, and similar international laws and regulations. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from improperly offering or paying anything of value to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Some of the Company’s customer relationships are with governmental entities and therefore may be subject to such anti-bribery laws. The AKS and similar fraud and abuse laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions prohibit persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a health care program, such as, in the United States, Medicare or Medicaid.

The Company’s production and sale of products is further subject to regulations concerning the supply of conflict minerals, various environmental regulations such as the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and others enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) or equivalent state agencies, and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the “Health Care Reform Law”). In the sale, delivery and servicing of the Company’s products to other countries, it must also comply with various domestic and foreign export control and trade embargo laws and regulations, including those administered by the Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) and similar international governmental agencies, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions relating to certain countries and/or with certain individuals identified by the respective government. Despite the Company’s internal compliance program, policies and procedures may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by its employees or agents. Violations of these requirements are punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and imprisonment. Due in part to its direct-to-consumer model, the Company’s Byte aligner business in the U.S. is subject to various state laws, rules and policies which govern the practice of dentistry within such state. Byte contracts with an expansive nationwide network of independent licensed dentists and orthodontists for the provision of clinical services, including the oversight and control of each customer’s clinical treatment in order to comply with these regulations and ensure that the business does not violate rules pertaining to the corporate practice of dentistry.

The Company is subject to domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders governing data privacy and transparency, including, but not limited to, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (the “HITECH Act”), the California Consumer Privacy Act, China’s Personal Information Protection Law, the Physician Payments Sunshine Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the European Union’s General Data Production Regulation, the EU Directive 2002/58/EC (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder), France’s Data Protection Act of 1978 (rev. 2004) and France’s Loi Bertrand, certain rules issued by Denmark’s Health and Medicines Authority, and similar international laws and regulations. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and similar data-privacy laws applicable in non-U.S. jurisdictions, restrict the use and disclosure of personal health information, mandate the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information and require us to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information. The Physician Payments Sunshine Provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act require the Company to record all transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for public disclosure. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted in several states, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals.

The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate its business. There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, sanctions. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional detail.

Environmental, Health & Safety Matters

Dentsply Sirona believes that Environmental, Health & Safety ("EHS") is critical to the success of our customers and our Company. We are committed to environmental stewardship and to health and safety excellence in our global operations and distribution. As such, we have adopted policies that call for compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety of our employees, and neighboring communities. The Company believe that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.

Safety is integrated into the way we do business. Our safety program is structured on the foundation that every employee is engaged and committed to improving safe operating practices and eliminating or reducing the risk for injuries or illnesses. When health and safety incidents do occur, we strive to determine the causes and eliminate the potential for future similar incidents.

Our EHS policies and standards are a key element of the foundation upon which we develop, market, manufacture, and distribute products and services to our global customers. We operate our manufacturing facilities using a common set of internal standards. These standards support a consistent approach to EHS performance improvement.

Other Factors Affecting the Business

The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales, net income and cash flows. The Company typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the first or fourth quarter. Price changes, other marketing and promotional programs including trade shows, management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in any given period. In addition, major new product introductions may also impact net sales as older products become less desirable compared to the new products. Sales for the industry and the Company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters, due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.

The Company tries to maintain short lead times within its manufacturing, as such, the backlog on products is generally not material to the financial statements.

Securities Exchange Act Reports

The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including the Company, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that the Company files with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov. The Company files annual reports, quarterly reports, proxy statements and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”).

Forward-Looking Statements and Associated Risks

All statements in this Form 10-K that do not directly and exclusively relate to historical facts constitute “forward-looking statements.” These statements represent current expectations and beliefs, and no assurance can be given that the results described in such statements will be achieved. Such statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements, many of which are outside of our control. Furthermore, many of these risks and uncertainties are currently amplified by and may continue to be amplified by the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the impact of varying private and governmental responses that affect our customers, employees, vendors and the economies and communities where they operate. No assurance can be given that any expectation, belief, goal or plan set forth in any forward-looking statement can or will be achieved, and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements which speak only as of the date they are made. We do not undertake any obligation to update or release any revisions to any forward-looking statement or to report any events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-K or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

You should carefully consider these and other relevant factors, including those risk factors in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K and any other information included or incorporated by reference in this report, and information which may be contained in the Company’s other filings with the SEC, when reviewing any forward-looking statement. Investors should understand it is impossible to predict or identify all such factors or risks. As such, you should not consider either foregoing lists, or the risks identified in the Company’s SEC filings, to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties associated with an investment in the Company.
