Item 1A: Risk Factors

This “Risk Factors” section contains references to our “capital stock” and to our “stockholders.” Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our “capital stock” represent our common stock and any class or series of preferred stock which may be outstanding from time to time, while the references to our “stockholders” represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of outstanding preferred stock.

Risks Related to Our Business and Industry

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

The COVID-19 pandemic, including the continued spread of new variants, has had, and other pandemics in the future could have, repercussions across global economies and financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have adversely impacted regional, national and global economic activity and have contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has rapidly evolved and, as cases and variants of COVID-19 have continued to increase and be identified, many countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Spain, have reacted by, among other things, instituting quarantines and restricting travel. Many national, state and local governments, including in areas where we own properties, have also reacted by instituting quarantines, restrictions on travel, shelter-in-place orders, vaccine requirements, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, school closures, vaccine and testing requirements, limitations on attendance at events or other gatherings, and social distancing requirements, and additional national, state and local governments may implement similar restrictions. In that regard, surges in COVID-19 cases have led many state and local governments to increase the scope and severity of some of these restrictions and to institute new restrictions.

As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have negatively impacted the global, national and regional economies generally and many industries, directly or indirectly, and those impacts may continue and may increase in severity, including potentially triggering prolonged periods of negative or limited economic growth. Factors that have contributed or may contribute to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread on the business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of us and our clients include, without limitation, the following:

•A complete or partial closure of, or other operational limitations or issues at, properties operated by our clients resulting from government action (including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantine, vaccine and testing requirements, shelter-in-place or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes) or client action;

•Reduced economic activity, customer traffic, consumer confidence or discretionary spending, the deterioration in our or our clients’ ability to operate in affected areas and any delays in the supply of products or services to our clients may impact certain of our clients’ businesses, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and may cause certain of our clients to be unable to meet their obligations to us in full, or at all, and to seek, whether through negotiation, restructuring or bankruptcy, reductions or deferrals in their rent payments and other obligations to us or early termination of their leases;

•We may experience difficulties, some of which may be related to supply chain disruptions, in leasing, selling or redeveloping vacant properties or renewing expiring or terminated leases on terms we consider acceptable, or at all;

•We may experience difficulty accessing the bank lending, capital markets and other financial markets on attractive terms, or at all, and a severe disruption or instability in the national or global financial markets or deterioration in credit and financing conditions may adversely affect our cost of capital, our access to capital to grow our business (including through acquisitions, development opportunities and other strategic transactions) and to fund our business operations, our ability to pay dividends on our common stock, our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, and our other liabilities on a timely basis, and our clients’ ability to fund their business operations and meet their obligations to us and others;

•The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our credit ratings, the interest rates on our borrowings, and our future compliance with financial covenants under our credit facility and other debt instruments, which could result in a default and potentially an acceleration of indebtedness, any of which could 

-26-
negatively impact our ability to make additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to sell commercial paper notes under our commercial paper program or incur other indebtedness, and pay dividends on our common stock and to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, and our other obligations when due;

•The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market value of our properties has led to impairment charges and may require that we incur further impairment charges, asset write-downs or similar charges;

•The impact on the ability of our employees, including members of our management team or board of directors, to fulfill their duties to us as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, either as a result of measures taken to limit its spread or as a result of infection; and

•A general decline in business activity and demand for real estate transactions could adversely affect our ability to grow our portfolio of properties.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our clients will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or limit its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread have adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact, among other things, the ability of a number of our clients’ to generate adequate, or in certain cases, any revenue from their businesses, the ability or willingness of many of our clients to pay rent in full, or at all, or on a timely basis, and our ability to collect rent from our clients. It may also adversely impact our ability to enforce remedies for the failure to pay rent, our occupancy levels, our ability to acquire properties or complete construction projects, and may otherwise negatively affect our business.

Most of our clients operate retail businesses, many of which appear to have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to mitigate its spread. These adverse impacts have, at times, reduced the amount of rent we have been able to collect from our clients in those industries and may further decrease the likelihood of us collecting such rent in the future. In addition, if any of these or other clients declare bankruptcy or enter into similar corporate restructuring arrangements, they may seek to reject or renegotiate our existing leases, which could adversely affect our ability to collect rent that is owed or to collect future rent on those properties at anticipated rates, or at all, or to re-lease those properties on favorable terms.

In addition, most of our clients operate retail businesses that depend on customer traffic. As a result, conditions that lead to a decline in customer traffic (including quarantine, shelter-in-place or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes or orders requiring business closures or restricting business operations) have had and so long as those conditions continue to exist will continue to have an adverse effect on the business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of a number of our clients, and their willingness or ability to pay rent, to renew expiring leases or to enter into new leases on terms favorable to us, or at all.

In addition to the near-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our clients and their businesses, we are unable to predict at this time the broader long-term impacts on consumer behavior in regard to brick-and-mortar retail and service-based businesses. To the extent certain adverse factors, including but not limited to, continued patterns of consumer savings and unemployment, persist, certain discretionary businesses could have prolonged negative consequences as a result of shifts in long-term consumer behavior.

As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the number of our clients that will not pay rent in the future, nor can we predict whether our clients who have paid rent in the past will continue to do so or whether our clients who have deferred rent will pay such rent in the future. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, our clients may cease to pay their rent obligations to us in full or at all, and our clients may elect not to renew their leases, seek to terminate their leases, seek relief from their leases (including through negotiation, restructuring or bankruptcy), or decline to renew expiring leases or enter into new leases, all of which may adversely impact our rental revenue and occupancy rates, generate additional expenses, result in impairment charges or other write-downs of assets, and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, as we believe to be the case with many retail landlords, we have received and may continue to receive short-term rent relief requests, most often in the form of rent deferral requests, or requests for further discussion from our clients. Collections and rent relief requests to-date may not be indicative of collections or requests in any future period.

Likewise, the deterioration of global economic conditions as a result of the pandemic may ultimately lead to a further decrease in occupancy levels and rental rates across our portfolio as our clients reduce or defer their spending, institute restructuring plans or file for bankruptcy. Some of our major clients have experienced temporary closures of some or all of their properties or have substantially altered or reduced their operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and additional clients may do so in the future. In addition, the measures taken to prevent the spread of 

-27-
COVID-19 (including quarantine, shelter-in-place or similar orders requiring that people remain in their homes) have led and may lead to further closures, or other operational issues or changes at our properties, or delays in acquisition activities, construction projects, and other corporate actions, all of which may materially adversely impact our operations.

In addition, in light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken certain precautionary measures within our organization intended to help reduce the risk of the virus to our employees, our clients, and the communities in which we operate, including instituting a work-from-home policy for our employees and limiting non-essential travel and in-person attendance at industry events.

While we anticipate that these measures are temporary, we cannot predict the specific duration for which these precautionary measures will stay in effect, and we may elect to take additional measures as the information available to us continues to develop. These actions, and any future actions we may take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, could further negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.

For the foregoing reasons, we expect that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures, including the impact on regional, national and global economies, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, and, given unpredictability of the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, such impacts may be material.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures continue to adversely affect regional, national and global economic conditions and financial markets, as well as the business, results of operations, financial conditions and liquidity of us and our clients, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, including the risks resulting from our significant indebtedness; our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, to pay dividends on our common stock, to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, and provide for our other cash needs; our ongoing need for external financing; our ability to access borrowings under our credit facility and to sell notes under our commercial paper program; our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness; our ability to integrate VEREIT’s business or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger; our dependency on key personnel; and the impact of negative market conditions or adverse events on our clients. In addition, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to limit its spread, our historical information regarding our business, properties, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity may not be representative of the future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or other financial or operating results of us, our properties or our business.

In order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties. The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.

 We face competition in the acquisition and operation of our properties. We expect competition from:

•Businesses;

•Individuals;

•Fiduciary accounts and plans; and

•Other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.

Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.

Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential clients, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new clients, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.

Cash flow from operations depends in part on our ability to lease space to our clients on economically favorable terms and to collect rent from our clients on a timely basis. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:

•Lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;

•Inability to retain existing clients and attract new clients;

•Oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;

•Declines in our clients’ creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, economic downturns and competition within their industries from other operators;

-28-
•Defaults by and bankruptcies of clients, failure of clients to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of our clients to comply with their contractual obligations;

•Changes in laws, rules or regulations that negatively impact clients or our properties;

•The current COVID-19 pandemic (see “Risk Factors — The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations and is expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity” above) or other pandemics or outbreaks of illness, disease or virus that affect countries or regions in which our clients and their parent companies operate or in which our properties or corporate headquarters are located;

•Economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located; and

•Deterioration of physical condition of our properties.

At any time, any of our clients may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a client may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any client bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of our client’s lease and material losses to us.

If our clients do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, improvements on behalf of the client or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and service our indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, our clients may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.

Further, the occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases. The occurrence of a client bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from our client’s lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize our client to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt client for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would result in rent payments that would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases (although it is possible that we may not receive any unpaid future rent under terminated leases) or we may elect not to pursue claims against a client for terminated leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full, or at all. Moreover, in the case of a client’s leases that are not terminated as the result of its bankruptcy, we may be required or elect to reduce the rent payable under those leases or provide other concessions, reducing amounts we receive under those leases. As a result, client bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Any of these events could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service our indebtedness.

As of December 31, 2021, 164 of our properties were available for lease or sale. As of December 31, 2021, no single client or group of our clients in the same industry accounted for more than 10% of our total portfolio annualized contractual rent. Downturns in any of our industries could adversely affect our clients, which in turn could also have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock, and any outstanding preferred stock.

In addition, some properties are leased to clients that may have limited financial and other resources, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses, including any downturns that have resulted or may result from the COVID-19 pandemic, or in the regional, national, or international economy.

As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.

Investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of:

•Our knowledge of the contamination;

•The timing of the contamination;

-29-
•The cause of the contamination; or

•The party responsible for the contamination of the property.

There may be environmental conditions associated with our properties of which we are unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances. Certain of our other properties, particularly those leased for industrial-type purposes, may also involve operations or activities that could give rise to environmental liabilities.

The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our client's ability to continue to operate that property or our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs or third party liability claims. Although our leases generally require our clients to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the clients’ activities on the properties, we could nevertheless be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our clients could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition, or our ability to make distributions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.

In addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and we may acquire other buildings that contain asbestos in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance, and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.

While we have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to environmental contamination, if environmental contamination should exist on any of our properties, we could be subject to liability, including strict liability, by virtue of our ownership interest. In addition, while we maintain environmental insurance policies, it is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and/or that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our clients are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that arise during the lease terms as a result of clients’ activities on the properties. For properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the clients generally are required to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, including maintaining certain minimum net worth requirements, obtaining environmental insurance, or relying upon the state trust funds where available in the states where these properties are located to reimburse responsible parties for costs of environmental remediation. However, it is possible that one or more of our clients could fail to have sufficient funds to cover any such indemnification or to meet applicable state financial assurance obligations, and thus we may still be obligated to pay for any such environmental liabilities.

If we fail to qualify as a REIT, it could adversely impact us, and the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.

We believe that, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot make any assurances that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.

Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.

-30-
For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).

If we fail to satisfy any of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:

•We would be required to pay regular United States, or U.S., federal corporate income tax on our taxable income;

•We would not be allowed a deduction for amounts distributed to our stockholders in computing our taxable income;

•We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;

•We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

•This treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. In addition, our taxable REIT subsidiaries, including Crest, are subject to federal, state and, in some cases, foreign taxes at the applicable tax rates on their income and property. Any failure to comply with legal and regulatory tax obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business and could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our investors.

The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Services, or the IRS, and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or the Treasury. Changes to the tax laws, with or without retroactive application, could adversely affect us or our investors, including holders of our common stock or debt securities. We cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect us or our investors. New legislation, Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, the federal income tax consequences of such qualification, or the federal income tax consequences of an investment in us. Also, the law relating to the tax treatment of other entities, or an investment in other entities, could change, making an investment in such other entities more attractive relative to an investment in a REIT.

The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, has significantly changed the U.S. federal income taxation of U.S. businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. We are continuing to assess the potential impact of TCJA on us as related regulations are proposed and finalized. 

Although a number of regulations related to TCJA became final after 2017, there are still a number of proposed regulations open for comment, and further changes may be made in light of changes in the U.S. government. The legislation is still unclear in some respects and could be subject to further potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the Treasury and IRS, any of which could lessen or increase the impact of the legislation. In addition, state and local tax jurisdictions, which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities, are continuing to evaluate the legislation to determine their respective levels of conformity to the new law. While some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going forward basis. We continue to work with our tax advisors and auditors to determine the full impact that the tax legislation as a whole will have on us.

Distribution requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.

To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income, excluding net capital gains, each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.

In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.

-31-
We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.

Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.

Our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by our Board of Directors). Accordingly, our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.

We may acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions, which could result in stockholder dilution and limit our ability to sell or refinance such assets.

We have in the past and may in the future acquire properties or portfolios of properties through tax deferred contribution transactions in exchange for partnership units in an operating partnership, which could result in stockholder dilution through the issuance of operating partnership units that, under certain circumstances, may be exchanged for shares of our common stock. This acquisition structure may have the effect of, among other things, reducing the amount of tax depreciation we could deduct over the tax life of the acquired properties, and may require that we agree to restrictions on our ability to dispose of, or refinance the debt on, the acquired properties in order to protect the contributors’ ability to defer recognition of taxable gain. Similarly, we may be required to incur or maintain debt we would otherwise not incur so we can allocate the debt to the contributors to maintain their tax bases. These restrictions could limit our ability to sell or refinance an asset at a time, or on terms, that would be favorable absent such restrictions.

We are subject to risks associated with debt and preferred stock financing.

We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and our $1.0 billion commercial paper program. The credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility also governs our $250.0 million unsecured term loan facility due March 2024. Our revolving credit facility grants us the option, subject to obtaining lender commitments and other customary conditions, to expand the borrowing limits thereunder to up to $4.0 billion. In addition, we have an unsecured commercial paper note program under which we may offer and sell up to $1.0 billion of commercial paper at any time. We use our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility as a liquidity backstop for the repayment of notes issued under the commercial paper program. Specifically, we maintain unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility equal to the aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program from time to time. We also may in the future enter into amendments and restatements of our current revolving credit facility and term loan facility, or enter into new revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities, and any such amended, restated or replacement revolving credit facilities or term loan facilities may increase the amounts we are entitled to borrow, subject to customary conditions, compared to our current revolving credit facility and term loan facility, or we may incur other indebtedness. We may also in the future increase the size of our commercial paper program. In addition, as a result of the merger, all outstanding secured indebtedness of VEREIT and its subsidiaries and all outstanding liabilities and other indebtedness of VEREIT and its subsidiaries (including $4.65 billion of additional senior unsecured notes that were originally issued by VEREIT OP, substantially all of which were subsequently exchanged for senior unsecured notes issued by us) became indebtedness and liabilities of ours or our subsidiaries, as the case may be, which has substantially increased the total secured indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries and the total liabilities and other indebtedness of our subsidiaries.

To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to make required payments on our debt or to pay dividends on our common stock. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rates on our revolving credit facility and term loan are variable and could therefore increase over time. In addition, commercial paper borrowings are short-term obligations and the interest rate on newly issued commercial paper varies according to market conditions at the time of issuance. We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or repay our debt as it comes due. Given past disruptions in the financial markets and ongoing global financial uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 and of the United 

-32-
Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (referred to as Brexit), we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our revolving credit facility may not be able to lend us money.

In addition, our revolving credit facility, our term loan facility and our mortgage loan documents contain provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of dividends and other distributions to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock. In particular, our revolving credit facility and our $250.0 million term loan facility, all of which are governed by the same credit agreement, provide that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit agreement) exists, we may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or any outstanding preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:

•The sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit agreement) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions made to holders of our outstanding preferred stock, if any, for that period, and

•The minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our stockholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and to avoid the payment of any income or excise taxes that would otherwise be imposed under specified sections of the Code on income we do not distribute to our stockholders,

except that we may repurchase or redeem shares of our outstanding preferred stock, if any, with net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our common stock or preferred stock. The credit agreement further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to one or more of our subsidiaries that in the aggregate meet a significance test set forth in the credit agreement, we and our subsidiaries (other than our wholly-owned subsidiaries) may not pay any dividends or make other distributions on (except for (a) distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the stockholders of that class and (b) dividends and distributions described in the second bullet point above), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock. If any such event of default under the credit agreement were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities could limit the amount of dividends or other distributions payable to holders of our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock or the amount of interest and principal we are able to pay on our indebtedness, or prevent us from paying those dividends, other distributions, interest or principal altogether, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT.

Our indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common stock, any outstanding preferred stock, and our debt securities, including:

•Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

•Requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and general corporate requirements;

•Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and

•Putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.

If we default under a credit facility, loan agreement or other debt instrument, the lenders will generally have the right to demand immediate repayment of the principal and interest on all of their loans and, in the case of secured indebtedness, to exercise their rights to seize and sell the collateral. Moreover, a default under a single loan or debt instrument may trigger cross-default or cross- acceleration provisions in other indebtedness and debt instruments, giving the holders of such other indebtedness and debt instruments similar rights to demand immediate repayment and to seize and sell any collateral.

Real estate ownership is subject to particular conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.

We are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate. In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur, and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:

-33-
•Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;

•Changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

•Changes in interest rates and operating expenses;

•Competition for our clients;

•Changes in market rents;

•Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

•Renewal of leases at lower rental rates;

•Inability to collect rental revenue from our clients due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;

•Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate;

•Uninsured property liability;

•Property damage or casualty losses;

•Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements, including requirements to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;

•The need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;

•Risks assumed as manager for pre-leased development or redevelopment projects;

•Physical or weather-related damage to properties;

•The potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;

•Acts of terrorism and war;

•The impacts of climate change; and 

•Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.

Real estate property investments are illiquid. We may not be able to dispose of properties when desired or on favorable terms.

Real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value, at a price and at terms that are acceptable to us, for any property that we are required to sell for liquidity reasons. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Our acquisition of additional properties may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.

Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage our acquisitions and expansion opportunities. We are regularly engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing, underwriting, and negotiating possible acquisition transactions. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits. Our inability to consummate one or more acquisitions on such terms, our failure to adequately underwrite and identify risks and obligations when acquiring properties, or our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions, could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations, including as a result of our incurrence of additional indebtedness and related interest expense and our assumption of unforeseen contingent liabilities in connection with completed acquisitions.

Furthermore, we have made and may continue to make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-client, net lease retail locations in the United States. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the United States, including in the United Kingdom and Spain, and properties leased to our clients engaged in non-retail businesses. These risks may include limited experience in managing certain types of new properties, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and the laws and culture of non-United States jurisdictions.

We are subject to additional risks from our international investments. 

We have acquired and may continue to acquire properties outside of the United States. These investments may expose us to a variety of risks that are different from and in addition to those commonly found in the United States. Our international investments are subject to additional risks, including:

•The laws, rules and regulations applicable in such jurisdictions outside of the United States, including those related to property ownership by foreign entities;

•Complying with a wide variety of foreign laws;

•Fluctuations in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar, and exchange controls;

-34-
•As we may not have or have only a limited number of properties within a jurisdiction, our experience in that market and with local business may be limited;

•Cultural factors and business practices that differ from our United States standards and practices including as they relate to rent adjustments, ground leases and property ownership requirements and limitations;

•Challenges in establishing effective controls and procedures to regulate operations in different regions and to monitor and ensure compliance with applicable regulations, such as applicable laws related to corrupt practices, employment, licensing, construction, climate change or environmental compliance;

•Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tax, tariffs, trade barriers and other laws within jurisdictions outside the United States or between the United States and such jurisdictions;

•Potentially adverse tax consequences with respect to our properties;

•The impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability, including deteriorations in political relations with the United States, instability in, or further withdrawals from, the European Union or other international trade alliances or agreements; and

•Political instability, uncertainty over property rights, civil unrest, drug trafficking, political activism or the continuation or escalation of terrorist or gang activities.

If we are unable to adequately address these risks, they could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.

We may engage in development or expansion projects or invest in new assets, which would subject us to additional risks that could negatively impact our operations. 

We may engage in development or other expansion projects, which could require us to raise additional capital and oversee state and local permitting. A decision by any governmental agency not to issue a required permit or substantial delays in the permitting process could prevent us from pursuing the development or expansion project. Additionally, any such new development or expansion project may not operate at designed capacity or may cost more to operate than we expect. The inability to successfully complete development or expansion projects or to complete them on a timely basis could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

In the future, we may invest in new or different assets or enter into new transaction structures that may or may not be closely related to our current business. These new assets and transaction structures may have new, different or increased risks than what we are currently exposed to in our business and we may not be able to manage these risks successfully. Additionally, when investing in such new assets or transaction structures, we will be exposed to the risk that those assets or structures, or the income generated thereby, will affect our ability to meet the requirements to maintain our REIT status. If we are not able to successfully manage the risks associated with such new assets, it could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 

An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, clients generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, clients are generally required, at the client’s expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our clients are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our clients are generally required to maintain general liability coverage depending on the client and the industry in which the client operates.

In addition to the indemnities and required insurance policies identified above, many of our properties are also covered by flood and earthquake insurance policies (subject to substantial deductibles) obtained and paid for by the clients as part of their risk management programs. Additionally, we have obtained blanket liability, flood and earthquake (subject to substantial deductibles) and property damage insurance policies to protect us and our properties against loss should the indemnities and insurance policies provided by the clients fail to restore the properties to their condition prior to a loss. We do not carry insurance for certain losses and certain types of losses may be either uninsurable or not economically insurable. However, should a loss occur that is uninsured or in an amount exceeding the combined aggregate limits for the policies noted above, or in the event of a loss that is subject to a substantial deductible under an insurance policy, we could lose all or part of our capital invested in, and anticipated revenue from, one or more of the properties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. We also face the risk that our insurance carriers 

-35-
may not be able to provide payment under any potential claims that might arise under the terms of our insurance policies, and we may not have the ability to purchase insurance policies we desire.

In addition, although we obtain title insurance policies on our properties to help protect us and our properties against title defects (such as adverse claims of ownership, liens or other encumbrances), there may be certain title defects that our title insurance will not cover. If a material title defect related to any of our properties is not adequately covered by a title insurance policy, we could lose some or all of our capital invested in and our anticipated profits from such property, cause a financial misstatement or damage our reputation.

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.

Our properties are generally required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA. The ADA has separate compliance requirements for “public accommodations” and “commercial facilities,” but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants. The retailers to whom we lease properties are obligated by law to comply with the ADA provisions, and we believe that these retailers may be generally obligated to cover costs associated with compliance. If required changes involve greater expenditures than anticipated, or if the changes must be made on a more accelerated basis than anticipated, the ability of these retailers to cover costs could be adversely affected and we could be required to expend our own funds to comply with the provisions of the ADA, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. In addition, we are required to operate our properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to our properties. We may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

Property taxes may increase without notice.

The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities. While the majority of our leases are under a net lease structure, some or all of such property taxes may not be collectible from our clients.

Our business is subject to risks associated with climate change and our sustainability strategies.

The effects of climate change, and a resulting shift to a lower carbon economy, could present several climate-related risks and opportunities for our business. Physical risks from climate change could result in both chronic and acute perils including, but not limited to, extreme weather, changes in precipitation and temperature, and rising sea levels, all of which may result in physical damage to, or a decrease in demand for, our properties located in the areas affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be severe or occur for lengthy periods of time, connectivity, labor and supply chains could impact business continuity for ourselves and our clients. This could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.

In addition, we seek to promote effective energy efficiency and other sustainability strategies and compliance with federal, state and international laws and regulations related to climate change, both internally and with our clients. Our sustainability strategies and efforts to comply with changes in federal, state and international laws and regulations on climate change could result in significant capital expenditures to improve our existing properties or properties we may acquire. Any changes to such laws and regulations could also result in increased operating costs or capital expenditures at our properties. If we are unable to comply with laws and regulations on climate change or implement effective sustainability strategies, our reputation among our clients and investors may be damaged and we may incur fines and/or penalties. Moreover, there can be no assurance that any of our sustainability strategies will result in reduced operating costs, higher occupancy or higher rental rates or deter our existing clients from relocating to properties owned by our competitors.

We are subject to risks related to the discontinuance of LIBOR.

Certain of our existing debt instruments and other financial arrangements, including our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility and our $250.0 million term loan facility, provide for borrowings to be made at variable interest rates that use the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings thereunder, and we may incur additional 

-36-
indebtedness or enter into new financial arrangements that use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for borrowing thereunder. Likewise, as part of our cash management practices we may from time to time invest available cash in financial instruments that use LIBOR as a benchmark for calculating interest payments or other obligations thereunder.

LIBOR is in the process of being discontinued. While certain U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will continue to be published on the current basis until June 30, 2023, all other LIBOR settings either are no longer being published or are being published only for a limited time and only on a “synthetic” basis (i.e., not on the basis of submissions made by panel banks). The regulator of the administrator of LIBOR has prohibited any new use of LIBOR by firms subject to its supervision, and certain regulators in the United States have stated that no new contracts using U.S. dollar LIBOR should be entered into after 2021. 

While our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility include provisions for establishing alternative reference rates when LIBOR is no longer be available, the consequences of the adoption of any such alternative reference rates cannot be predicted and could have an adverse impact on the amount of interest and commitment fees that we pay under those facilities. Likewise, the unavailability of LIBOR may have an adverse impact on interest rates and other financing costs under other debt instruments and other financial obligations of ours, as well as the market value of and the payments we receive under any LIBOR-linked securities or investments that we may own from time to time. In addition, financial markets generally may be adversely affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR, the uncertainties regarding its discontinuation, the alternative reference rates that are being or may be used in place of LIBOR and other issues related to LIBOR. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our charter contains restrictions upon ownership of our common stock.

Our charter contains restrictions on ownership and transfer of our common stock intended to, among other purposes, assist us in maintaining our status as a REIT for United States federal and/or state income tax purposes. For example, our charter restricts any person from acquiring beneficial or constructive ownership of more than 9.8% (by value or by number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding shares of common stock. These restrictions could have anti-takeover effects and could reduce the possibility that a third party will attempt to acquire control of us, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

The value of certain of our investment in real property may be reduced as the result of the expiration or loss of local tax abatements, tax credit programs, or other governmental incentives.

Certain of our investments have the benefit of governmental tax incentives aimed at inducing property users to relocate to incentivize development in areas and neighborhoods which have not historically seen robust commercial development. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided for such communities to be designated as Qualified Opportunity Zones, which are eligible for such tax benefits. These incentives typically have specific sunset provisions and may be subject to governmental discretion in the eligibility or award of the applicable incentives. The expiration of these incentive programs or the inability of potential clients or users to be eligible for or to obtain governmental approval of the incentives, or the inability to remain compliant with such programs, may have an adverse effect on the value of our investment, cash flow and net income, and may result in impairment charges.

Risks Relating to the Merger and the Transactions Contemplated by the Merger Agreement 

We may not be able to integrate VEREIT’s business successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and related benefits of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

The merger involved the combination of two companies which operated as independent public companies. We are required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of VEREIT. Potential difficulties we may encounter in the integration process include the following: 

•the inability to successfully combine the businesses of Realty Income and VEREIT in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the anticipated cost savings; 

•lost sales and clients as a result of certain clients of either of Realty Income or VEREIT deciding not to do business with the combined company; 

•the complexities associated with managing the combined company out of multiple locations and integrating personnel from the two companies; 

•the additional complexities of combining two companies with different histories, regulatory restrictions, markets and customer bases; 

-37-
•the complexities associated with combining Realty Income and VEREIT’s information technology systems including integrating the companies’ two enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms into one primary ERP tool; 

•the inability to realize expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements, synergies or other benefits;

•the failure to retain key employees of either of the two companies; and 

•performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by integrating Realty Income’s and VEREIT’s operations. 

Our historical and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements may not be representative of our results after the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. 

The merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the subsequent spin-off of Orion, were completed in November 2021. Accordingly, our historical financial statements and our operating results for the periods prior to such time do not give effect to those transactions. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements related to such transactions that we have previously prepared were created for informational purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the financial position or results of operations that actually would have occurred had the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement been completed as of the dates indicated, nor does it purport to be indicative of the future operating results or financial position of Realty Income after the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements reflect adjustments, which were based upon preliminary estimates, to allocate the purchase price to VEREIT’s assets and liabilities and certain estimates and assumptions regarding the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement that Realty Income and VEREIT believe are reasonable under the circumstances. In addition, the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not reflect other future events that occur after the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the costs related to the planned integration of the two companies and any future nonrecurring charges resulting from the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and do not consider potential impacts of current market conditions on revenues or expense efficiencies. As a result, we cannot assure you that our historical and unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements will be representative of our results for future periods.

General Risk Factors

The market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.

The market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time and may be outside of our control, including:

•Prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;

•The market for similar securities issued by other REITs;

•General economic, political and financial market conditions;

•The financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our clients and our competitors;

•Changes in legal and regulatory taxation obligations;

•Litigation and regulatory proceedings;

•Changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;

•Changes in our credit ratings;

•Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results of us and our competitors; and 

•Failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or if the effect of the merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on our results of operations or financial condition is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts. 

In addition, over the last several years, prices of common stock and debt securities in the United States, trading markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations, and the market values of our common stock and debt securities have also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.

-38-
Litigation risks could affect our business.

From time to time, we are involved in legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims including those that may arise out acquisitions, development opportunities and other strategic transactions. An unfavorable resolution of litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses and significantly divert the attention of management.

We depend on key personnel.

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. In addition, our success after the merger with VEREIT will depend in part upon our ability to retain executive officers and key employees who may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration following the merger or a desire not to remain with Realty Income. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net lease industry or retain employees to the same extent as in the past.

Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.

Natural disasters, terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or war, or other unexpected events may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that events like these will not occur or have a direct impact on our clients, our business or the United States or world generally.

If events like these were to occur, they could materially interrupt our business operations, cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.

We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of our business processes, including financial transactions and maintenance of records, which may include personal identifying information. Although we have taken steps to protect the security of the data maintained in our information systems, our security measures may not be able to prevent the systems’ improper functioning, or the theft of intellectual property, personal information, or personal property, such as in the event of cyber-attacks or ransom-ware attacks. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, result in theft of company assets, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, while we carry cyber liability insurance, such insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses related to such events.

Volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.

Various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values that are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability that can also be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.

Inherent limitations of internal controls over financial statements, disclosure controls and safeguarding of assets may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Our internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and our operating internal controls may not prevent or detect financial misstatements or loss of assets because of inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement and disclosure accuracy and safeguarding of assets.

-39-
Additionally, as a result of our merger with VEREIT, we are operating two separate ERP systems to execute our financial reporting until we can complete a full data migration and complete the related testing. We have started the process of integrating these two ERP platforms into one primary system and expect to complete the implementation process during 2022. We have updated our internal controls over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes for these parallel ERP systems, as we work towards enhanced automated controls through a central platform. However, utilization of parallel ERP systems has inherent risks, which can complicate our financial reporting controls and potentially lead to breakdowns in data integrity. This ERP integration also has required, and will continue to require, significant capital and human resources to deploy. In addition, potential flaws in implementing the primary ERP or in the failure of any portion/module of the ERP to meet our needs or provide appropriate controls may pose risks to our ability to operate successfully and efficiently and with an effective system of internal controls.

Failures in our internal controls could result in adverse consequences in our financial reporting and operations, including delays, additional costs, impairment in our ability to access capital, adverse impacts to investor confidence, regulatory review, or litigation.

Our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our ability to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned acquisitions and capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. We cannot make any assurances that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and any outstanding preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Disruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.

Historically, there have been periods where the global equity and credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which have caused market prices of equity and debt securities to fluctuate substantially and the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably. These circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the financial markets, making terms for certain financings less attractive, and in certain cases have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the equity and credit markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing at reasonable terms, which may adversely affect our ability to make acquisitions. A prolonged downturn in the equity or credit markets may cause us to seek alternative sources of potentially less attractive financing and may require us to adjust our business plan accordingly. In addition, these factors may make it more difficult for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell, as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of financing or difficulties in obtaining financing. These events in the equity and credit markets may make it more difficult or costly for us to raise capital through the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. These disruptions in the financial markets also may have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock and debt securities, the income we receive from our properties and the lease rates we can charge for our properties, as well as other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy in general.

Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our clients if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect our clients’ ability to pay rent. In addition, the U.K. government's plan to reform the Retail Price Index (RPI) to align with the Consumer Price Index (CPIH) may result in a lower measure of inflation and, in turn, have a negative impact on our lease revenue currently tied to RPI in the U.K.
