PART I

ITEM 1. Business

OVERVIEW 

We were founded in 1919 as Cummins Engine Company, a corporation in Columbus, Indiana and one of the first diesel engine manufacturers. In 2001, we changed our name to Cummins Inc. We are a global power leader that designs, manufactures, distributes and services diesel, natural gas, electric and hybrid powertrains and powertrain-related components including filtration, aftertreatment, turbochargers, fuel systems, controls systems, air handling systems, automated transmissions, electric power generation systems, batteries, electrified power systems, hydrogen production and fuel cell products. We sell our products to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), distributors, dealers and other customers worldwide. We serve our customers through a service network of approximately 500 wholly-owned, joint venture and independent distributor locations and more than 10,000 Cummins certified dealer locations in approximately 190 countries and territories.

COVID-19

The outbreak of COVID-19 in early 2020 became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession. The pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally, which negatively impacted our sales and results of operations during 2020. While the majority of the negative impacts to demand largely subsided in 2021, we are still experiencing supply chain disruptions and related financial impacts reflected as increased cost of sales. Our industry continues to be unfavorably impacted by supply chain constraints leading to shortages across multiple components categories and limiting our collective ability to meet end-user demand. Our customers are also experiencing other supply chain issues and slowing production.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

We have five complementary operating segments: Engine, Distribution, Components, Power Systems and New Power. These segments share technology, customers, strategic partners, brand recognition and our distribution network in order to compete more efficiently and effectively in their respective markets. In each of our operating segments, we compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. 

We use segment earnings or losses before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and noncontrolling interests (EBITDA) as the primary basis for the Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate the performance of each of our reportable operating segments. We believe EBITDA is a useful measure of our operating performance as it assists investors and debt holders in comparing our performance on a consistent basis without regard to financing methods, capital structure, income taxes or depreciation and amortization methods, which can vary significantly depending upon many factors. See Note 22, "OPERATING SEGMENTS," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information and a reconciliation of our segment information to the corresponding amounts in our Consolidated Statements of Net Income.

SUPPLY 

The performance of the end-to-end supply chain, extending through to our suppliers, is foundational to our ability to meet customers' expectations and support long-term growth. We are committed to having a robust strategy for how we select and manage our suppliers to enable a market focused supply chain. This requires us to continuously evaluate and upgrade our supply base, as necessary, as we strive to ensure we are meeting the needs of our customers.

We use a combination of proactive and reactive methodologies to enhance our understanding of supply base risks, which guide the development of risk monitoring and sourcing strategies. Our category strategy process (a process designed to create the most value for the company) supports the review of our long-term needs and guides decisions on what we make internally and what we purchase externally. For the items we decide to purchase externally, the strategies also identify the suppliers we should partner with long-term to provide the best technology, the lowest total cost and highest supply chain performance. We design and/or manufacture our strategic components used in or with our engines and power generation units and New Power products. Key suppliers are managed through long-term supply agreements that secure capacity, delivery, quality and cost requirements are met over an extended period. 

Other important elements of our sourcing strategy include:

• selecting and managing suppliers to comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct and

• assuring our suppliers comply with our prohibited and restricted materials policy.

As we adjust to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid return of demand in many manufacturing industries, we are experiencing supply chain disruptions, incremental costs and related challenges throughout the supply chain. We continue to monitor the supply chain disruptions utilizing early detection technology complemented by structured supplier risk and resiliency assessments. We increased frequency of formal and informal supplier engagement to address potentially impactful supply base constraints and enhanced collaboration to develop specific countermeasures to mitigate risks. Our global team, located in different regions of the world, uses various approaches to identify and resolve threats to supply continuity. 

10
PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own or control a significant number of patents and trademarks relating to the products we manufacture. These patents and trademarks were granted and registered over a period of years. Although these patents and trademarks are generally considered beneficial to our operations, we do not believe any patent, group of patents or trademark (other than our leading brand house trademarks) is significant to our business.

SEASONALITY

While individual product lines may experience modest seasonal variation in production, there is no material effect on the demand for the majority of our products on a quarterly basis with the exception that our Power Systems segment normally experiences seasonal declines in the first quarter due to general declines in construction spending during this period.

LARGEST CUSTOMERS

We have thousands of customers around the world and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of them. PACCAR is our largest customer, accounting for 15 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021, 15 percent in 2020 and 17 percent in 2019. We have long-term supply agreements with PACCAR for our heavy-duty and medium-duty engines and aftertreatment systems. While a significant number of our sales to PACCAR are under long-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for particular engine requirements for specific vehicle models and not a specific volume of engines or aftertreatment systems. PACCAR is our only customer accounting for more than 10 percent of our net sales in 2021. The loss of this customer or a significant decline in the production level of PACCAR vehicles that use our engines would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We have supplied engines to PACCAR for 77 years. A summary of principal customers for each operating segment is included in our segment discussion.

In addition to our agreement with PACCAR, we have long-term heavy-duty and medium-duty engine and aftertreatment system supply agreements with Navistar and Daimler. We also have an agreement with Stellantis to supply engines for its Ram trucks. Collectively, our net sales to these four customers, including PACCAR, were 33 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021, 32 percent in 2020 and 37 percent in 2019. Excluding PACCAR, net sales to any single customer were less than 8 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021, less than 7 percent in 2020 and less than 9 percent in 2019. These agreements contain standard purchase and sale agreement terms covering engine, aftertreatment and engine parts pricing, quality and delivery commitments, as well as engineering product support obligations. The basic nature of our agreements with OEM customers is that they are long-term price and operations agreements that help prove for the availability of our products to each customer through the duration of the respective agreements. Agreements with most OEMs contain bilateral termination provisions giving either party the right to terminate in the event of a material breach, change of control or insolvency or bankruptcy of the other party. 

BACKLOG

As we adjust to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid return of demand in many manufacturing industries, we are experiencing supply chain disruptions, incremental costs and related challenges throughout the supply chain. The supply chain disruptions are impacting our business as well as our suppliers and customers resulting in longer lead times in some of our businesses. We have supply agreements with some truck and off-highway equipment OEMs, however most of our business is transacted through open purchase orders. These open orders are historically subject to month-to-month releases and are subject to cancellation on reasonable notice without cancellation charges and therefore are not considered firm. We are working closely with our suppliers as discussed in the Supply section above as well as with customers to meet the demand and work through backlogs as efficiently as possible.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

In 2021, we continued to invest in future critical technologies and products. We will continue to make investments to develop new products and improve our current technologies to meet future emission requirements around the world and improve fuel economy performance of diesel and natural gas-powered engines and related components as well as development activities around fully electric, hybrid and hydrogen power solutions and hydrogen production.

Our research and development programs are focused on product improvements, product extensions, innovations and cost reductions for our customers. Research and development expenditures include salaries, contractor fees, building costs, utilities, testing, technical information technology expenses, administrative expenses and allocation of corporate costs and are expensed, net of contract reimbursements, when incurred. From time to time, we enter into agreements with customers and government agencies to fund a portion of the research and development costs of a particular project. When not associated with a sales contract, we generally account for these reimbursements as an offset to the related research and development expenditure. Research and development expenses, net of contract reimbursements, were $1.1 billion in 2021, $903 million in 2020 and $998 million in 2019. Contract reimbursements were $104 million, $86 million and $90 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

11
ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY

We are committed to making people's lives better by powering a more prosperous world. That prosperity includes strong communities, robust business and environmental sustainability. 

The highest level of accountability for our climate-related risks and opportunities is with the Safety, Environment and Technology (SET) Committee of the Board of Directors (the Board). The internal Action Committee for Environmental Sustainability meets monthly and reports to the Chairman and to the SET Committee at least annually.

In late 2019, we introduced PLANET 2050, a sustainability strategy focused on three priority areas: addressing climate change and air emissions, using natural resources in the most sustainable way and improving communities. Additional commitments followed in 2021 with Cummins Water Works, which is our multi-million dollar program for strengthening communities through sustainable water and addressing the global water crisis. The PLANET 2050 strategy includes nine specific goals to achieve by 2030, including science-based carbon dioxide reduction targets for newly sold products and facilities, as well as aspirational targets for 2050. We are currently evaluating how the new goals will be integrated into business planning and will report on progress beginning in 2022. Key areas of focus in 2021 included product decarbonization pathways, customer sustainability collaboration and circular economy efforts such as incorporating expanded lifecycle analysis tools.

The nine PLANET 2050 goals for 2030 are as follows:

•Reduce absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from facilities and operations by 50 percent.

•Reduce scope three absolute lifetime GHG emissions from newly sold products by 25 percent.

•Partner with customers to reduce scope three GHG emissions from products in the field by 55 million metric tons.

•Reduce volatile organic compounds emissions from paint and coating operations by 50 percent.

•Create a circular lifecycle plan for every part to use less, use better, use again.

•Generate 25 percent less waste in facilities and operations as percent of revenue.

•Reuse or responsibly recycle 100 percent of packaging plastics and eliminate single-use plastics in dining facilities, employee amenities and events.

•Reduce absolute water consumption in facilities and operations by 30 percent.

•Produce net water benefits that exceed our annual water use in all our regions.

The most recent Sustainability Progress Report, prior reports and a Data Book of more detailed environmental data in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative's Standard core compliance designation is available on our website at www.cummins.com. Our annual submission to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for climate change and water are also available on the website. The climate submission provides information on our scenario planning for climate and other risks and detailed facility emissions data as requested by CDP. In 2021, we published our second report in accordance with the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board as well as our first report following the framework of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. These reports and data book are not incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference. 

We continue to articulate our positions on key public policy issues and on a wide range of environmental issues. We are actively engaged around the world to promote science-based climate policies by working with regulatory, industry and other stakeholders, including joining advocacy groups and testifying before legislators and regulators. We will continue to work in partnership with others to advocate for tough, clear and enforceable regulations around the globe to address air and GHG emissions. In 2021, we were named to the S&P Dow Jones World and North American Sustainability Indices. It was the sixteenth consecutive time we were named to the North American index and the first time we were named to the world index since 2013. We were also named one of the inaugural recipients of the Prince Charles' Terra Carta Seal, recognizing companies for their leadership in climate action and sustainability. 

We were named to Investor Business Daily's Best ESG Companies list for performance on environmental, social and governance matters, ranking number 37. We were also ranked number 84 among Barron's Top 100 Most Sustainable Companies.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE 

Product Certification and Compliance

Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that directly or indirectly impose standards governing emissions and noise. Over the past several years we have increased our global environmental compliance presence and expertise to understand and meet emerging product environmental regulations around the world. Our ability to comply with these and future 

12
emission standards is an essential element in maintaining our leadership position in regulated markets. We made, and will continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these standards. 

We strive to be a leader in developing and implementing technologies that provide customers with the highest performing products while minimizing the impact on the environment, and we have a long history of working with governments and regulators to achieve these goals. We remain committed to ensuring our products meet all current and future emission standards and delivering value to our customers.

Formed in 2019, the Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs team leads both engine emissions certification and compliance and regulatory affairs initiatives and is overseen and reports directly to the SET Committee of the Board at least annually. This organization is led by the Vice President - Product Compliance and Regulatory Affairs who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. The Vice President is a member of both the Cummins Executive Team and Cummins Leadership Team. The focus of this organization is to strengthen our ability to design great products that help our customers win while complying with increasingly challenging global emission regulations. The organization also works to enhance our collaboration with the agencies setting the direction and regulations of emissions as we strive to meet every expectation today while planning for future changes.

Following conversations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) regarding certification for the engines in the 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks, we made the decision to review our certification process and compliance with emission standards. This review is being conducted with external advisers as we strive to ensure the certification and all of our processes for our pick-up truck applications are consistent with our internal policies, engineering standards and applicable laws. We are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pick-up truck applications and to fully address the regulators’ requirements. Based on discussions with the regulators, we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since September 2019. During our discussions, the regulators turned their attention to other model years and other engines, most notably our pick-up truck applications for RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks for model years 2013 through 2018. We will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance. See Note 14, "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES," to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Engine Certifications 

Our engines are certified globally through various categories within on-highway and off-highway applications. Regulations in these categories typically control nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM) and GHG. The current on-highway NOx and PM emission standards came into effect in India on April 1, 2020, (Bharat Stage VI), China on July 1, 2019, (National Standard NS VI), the European Union (EU) on January 1, 2013, (Euro VI) and on January 1, 2010, for the EPA. To meet these regulations, mid-range and heavy-duty engines for India, China, EU and EPA require NOx aftertreatment. NOx reduction is achieved by an integrated technology solution comprised of the XPI High Pressure Common Rail fuel system, SCR technology (in some cases), next-generation cooled EGR, advanced electronic controls, proven air handling and the Cummins Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF). The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, EU, EPA and CARB certified that our engines meet the current emission requirements. Emission standards in international markets, including Japan, Mexico, Australia, Brazil and Russia are becoming more stringent. We believe that our experience in meeting the EU and EPA emission standards leaves us well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in these markets as the need for emission control capability grows.

In 2013, we certified to EPA's first ever GHG regulations for on-highway medium and heavy-duty engines. Additionally, the EPA's 2013 regulations added the requirement of on-board diagnostics, which were introduced on the ISX 15 in 2010, across the full on-highway product line while maintaining the same near-zero emission levels of NOx and PM required in 2010. On-board diagnostics provide enhanced service capability with standardized diagnostic trouble codes, service tool interface, in-cab warning lamp and service information availability. The new GHG and fuel-efficiency regulations were required for all heavy-duty diesel and natural gas engines beginning in January 2014. Our GHG certification was the first engine certificate issued by the EPA and uses the same proven base engine with the XPI fuel system, variable geometry turbocharger (VGTTM) and Cummins aftertreatment system with DPF and SCR technology. Application of these engines and aftertreatment technologies continues in our products that comply with the 2021 GHG regulations.

Our off-highway engines designed for Tier 4 / Stage V standards were based on our extensive on-highway experience developing SCR, high pressure fuel systems, DPF and VGTTM. Our products offer low fuel consumption, high torque rise and power output, extended maintenance intervals, reliable and durable operation and a long life to overhaul period, all while meeting the most stringent emission standards in the industrial market. Our off-highway products power multiple applications including construction, mining, marine, agriculture, rail, defense and oil and gas and serve a global customer base. The current EPA Tier 4 off-highway emission standards came into effect between 2013-2015 for all engine power categories. The current EU Stage V off-highway emission standards became effective in 2019 for certain engine power categories and were completely effective January 2021 for all remaining categories.

Other Environmental Statutes and Regulations 

Expenditures for environmental control activities and environmental remediation projects at our facilities in the U.S. were not a substantial portion of our annual expenses and are not expected to be material in 2022. We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with laws and regulations applicable to our plants and operations.

In the U.S., pursuant to notices received from federal and state agencies and/or defendant parties in site environmental contribution actions, we were identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended or similar state laws, at fewer than 20 waste disposal sites. 

Based upon our experiences at similar sites we believe that our aggregate future remediation costs will not be material. We have established accruals that we believe are adequate for our expected future liability with respect to these sites. In addition, we have several other sites where we are working with governmental authorities on remediation projects. The costs for these remediation projects are not expected to be material.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 

At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 59,900 persons worldwide. Approximately 21,200 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2022 and 2026.

Throughout our company’s 100-year history, we always recognized that people drive the strength of our business and our ability to effectively serve our clients and sustain our competitive position. We are focused on harmonizing our approach to talent to provide seamless opportunities and better experiences to our employees around the world. The disruptive events in 2020 and 2021 highlighted the importance for us to complete the strategic work in Human Resources to encourage all employees to reach their full potential. This strategy has key focus areas: creating a diverse and inclusive work environment; engaging employees and their families in improving wellness; developing self-aware and effective leaders; and extending our talent management philosophies in performance management, compensation management, competency building, and access to development opportunities to all employees.

Leadership and Talent Management

Managing our human capital resources is a key focus of the company. In 2020, the Board recast our Compensation Committee as the Talent Management and Compensation Committee to reflect the Board’s commitment to overseeing and providing guidance to our leadership team in this important work. 

We strive to create a leadership culture that begins with authentic leaders who create an outstanding place to work by encouraging all employees to achieve their full potential. We encourage leaders to connect our people and their work to our mission, vision, values, brand promise and strategies of the company, motivating and giving them a higher sense of purpose. We have developed leadership and employee development programs for employees ranging from the manufacturing floor and technicians through middle management and executive development. When an individual joins Cummins, we are committed to providing both that employee and their manager with the tools and resources to manage their career and navigate in a large global organization. Through our Talent Management strategy our goal is to provide all employees access to the development and career opportunities that a global company enables.

Competitive Pay and Benefits

To attract and retain the best employees, we focus on providing competitive pay and benefits. Our programs target the market for competitiveness and sustainability while ensuring that we honor our core values. We provide benefit programs with the goal of improving physical, mental and financial wellness of our employees throughout their lifetime. Some examples include base and variable pay, medical, paid time off, retirement saving plans and employee stock purchase plans.

When designing our base pay compensation ranges, we do market analysis to be sure ranges are current and our employees are advancing their earning potential. We also do annual compensation studies to assess market movement, pay equity and living wages. For example, in 2018, we conducted a living wage analysis globally as we strive to ensure our employees were making a living wage in the countries they live and work. We incorporated this living wage assessment into our annual compensation structure to work to ensure that current and new hires never fall below this threshold. In the U.S. for example, the living wage in 2019 was $15 per hour, although most positions pay more than that. We review wages globally as we continuously work to ensure we are fair, equitable, competitive and can attract and retain the best talent.

We also provide diverse benefit programs that are aligned with our values and focused on supporting employees and their families based on their unique needs, some of which are: tiered health care cost so that more junior employees pay less for their premiums; paid parental leave for primary and secondary caregivers; advanced medical services from clinicians to support complex health care needs and employee assistance programs with diverse providers that can meet a range of employee needs from race related trauma to financial planning to transgender transition support.

Employee Safety and Wellness 

Cummins is committed to being world-class in health and safety. We strive to ensure a workplace with zero incidents. We are committed to removing conditions that cause personal injury or occupational illness and we make decisions and promote behaviors that protect others from risk of injury. We publicly disclose metrics on our rate of recordable injuries, our rate of lost workdays due to injury and the rate of injuries involving contractors.

Our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic illustrated our commitment to safety. To support both our customers and communities, we made keeping employees safe our top priority. Most of our employees who can work from home have done so since the outbreak of the pandemic and we provided them with the tools and support to do so. This allowed us to focus resources and investments on our engineering and production facilities. In those facilities, we have taken many steps to protect the health and safety of our people, including:

•Masks required inside open plants and facilities.

•Redesigned exits, entrances and production lines to encourage social distancing.

•Expanded healthcare and leave programs to support employees and their families.

•Manufacturing our own face masks to provide to our employees free of charge.

•In 2021, we launched an aggressive global effort to acquire vaccines and provide them onsite or near-site to our employees, their families and other stakeholders. By partnering with governments and health care providers, we facilitated the delivery of over 45,000 doses of approved vaccines to employees at or near the workplace. This includes over 5,000 shots in the U.S., over 30,000 shots in India and over 10,000 shots in Mexico.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Diversity, equity and inclusion at all levels of the company are critical to our ability to innovate, to win in the marketplace and to create sustainable success. Having diverse, equitable and inclusive workplaces allows us to attract and retain the best employees to deliver results for our shareholders. This is exemplified by the composition of the Board of which 5 of 13 directors are female and 5 of 13 directors are ethnically diverse. In addition, over 50 percent of our executive team is female, and 45 percent of our leadership team is female. We disclose publicly the percentage of women in supervisory roles and the overall workforce. We also launched several initiatives to increase representation of minorities in the workplace. We created a Global Inclusion Leadership Council to oversee more than 100 employee resource groups around the world to provide opportunities to employees from all backgrounds for leadership training, cross cultural learning and professional development. In 2020, we launched Cummins Advocating for Racial Equity (CARE), which seeks to drive a sustainable impact in dismantling institutional racism and creating systemic equity. CARE now has hundreds of employees engaged and has deployed over $20 million in funding to fight racial injustice in the U.S.
