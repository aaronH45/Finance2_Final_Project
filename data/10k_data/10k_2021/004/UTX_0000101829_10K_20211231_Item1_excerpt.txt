PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

Raytheon Technologies Corporation is an aerospace and defense company that provides advanced systems and services for commercial, military and government customers worldwide. The terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Raytheon Technologies,” “RTC” and the “Company” mean Raytheon Technologies Corporation, unless the context indicates another meaning. We serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services segments of the aerospace industry. Our defense business serves both domestic and international customers as a prime contractor or subcontractor on a broad portfolio of defense and related programs for military and government customers. Raytheon Technologies, formerly known as United Technologies Corporation (UTC), was incorporated in Delaware in 1934 and represents the combination of UTC’s aerospace businesses and Raytheon Company through the Separation Transactions and Distributions and Raytheon Merger completed in April 2020, as described in more detail below. 

The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” within Item 7 of this Form 10-K, including the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.”

Separation Transactions and Distributions; Raytheon Merger. On April 3, 2020, UTC completed the separation of its business into three independent, publicly traded companies – UTC, Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis) (such separations, the “Separation Transactions”). UTC distributed all of the outstanding shares of Carrier common stock and all of the outstanding shares of Otis common stock to UTC shareowners who held shares of UTC common stock as of the close of business on March 19, 2020, the record date for the distributions (the “Distributions”) effective at 12:01 a.m., Eastern Time, on April 3, 2020. The historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. Immediately following the completion of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, on April 3, 2020, UTC and Raytheon Company completed their all-stock merger of equals transaction (the “Raytheon Merger”), pursuant to which Raytheon Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of UTC and UTC was renamed “Raytheon Technologies Corporation.”

Pratt & Whitney’s Commercial Engines and Military Engines businesses design, develop, produce and maintain families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft for commercial customers and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft for military customers. Pratt & Whitney’s small engine business, Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC), is among the world’s leading suppliers of engines powering regional airlines, general and business aviation, as well as helicopters. Pratt & Whitney also produces, sells and services military and commercial auxiliary power units. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services in all of these segments. 

Pratt & Whitney sells products and services principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s largest commercial customer by sales is Airbus, with sales, prior to discounts and incentives, of 31%, 30% and 31% of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Pratt & Whitney produces the PW1000G Geared Turbofan (GTF) engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PW1000G GTF engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PW1000G GTF engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft and have been certified by the Russian civil aviation authority to power the Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft. In addition, P&WC’s PW800 engine has been selected to exclusively power Gulfstream’s G400, G500 and G600 business jets, as well as to power Dassault’s Falcon 6X business jet, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022.

Pratt & Whitney is under contract to produce and sustain the F135 engine for the U.S. government’s F-35 Joint Program Office to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) produced by Lockheed Martin. F135 propulsion system configurations are used for the U.S Air Force’s F-35A, the U.S. Marine Corps’ F-35B and the U.S. Navy’s F-35C jets. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and other countries through foreign military sales arrangements. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and to develop next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force.

The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities for Pratt & Whitney. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2021, the interests of third-party collaboration participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed jet engine programs ranged, in the aggregate per program, from 13% to 49%. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of our accounting for collaboration arrangements. Pratt & Whitney also continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion, utilizing similar collaboration arrangements. 

In 2021, Pratt & Whitney reached significant milestones on the GTF engine program, including the first flight of the GTF Advantage engine for the A320neo family. The GTF Advantage configuration further extends the economic and environmental benefits of the existing GTF engine, as it reduces fuel consumption by an additional 1 percent, extending the engine's lead as the most efficient powerplant for the A320neo family. The GTF family now powers more than 1,100 aircraft across 58 airlines and three aircraft platforms: Airbus A320neo family, Airbus A220 and Embraer E-Jets E2. Also in 2021, Pratt & Whitney’s V2500 program achieved 250 million flight hours. Pratt & Whitney was announced as the engine provider on the Dassault Falcon 6X and Gulfstream G400, representing two new platforms for its PW800 engine. In addition, Pratt & Whitney received a significant number of contract awards for the F135 program, which powers all three variants of the F-35 Lightning II fighter aircraft and achieved several F135 production milestones, including the delivery of the 800th production engine and continuing to add more F135 engine maintenance, repair, overhaul and upgrade (MRO&U) global capacity by activating MRO&U facilities, or depots, in the Netherlands and Australia. Significant activity continued on development programs, including testing the first XA101 engine as part of the Adaptive Engine Transition Program.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business

As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in Item 1, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively affect the global economy, our business and operations, and the industries in which we operate. Government, business and individual actions in response to COVID-19 have resulted in continued disruption to air travel and commercial activities and significant restrictions and limitations on businesses, particularly within the aerospace and commercial airline industries. While commercial air travel in certain areas appears to be recovering, it continues to lag in other areas and remains below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, the ongoing disruption from the pandemic continues to adversely affect our airline and airframer customers and their demand for 

6
the products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney businesses. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and continuing economic recovery continues to negatively impact the global supply chain and distribution capabilities and we have experienced negative impacts from supply chain pressures. The pandemic continues to cause product and labor shortages, delivery delays, and increased costs of raw materials, labor and supplier products and services around the world. We are working with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials, components and other supplies and to reduce supply chain costs.

Our RIS and RMD businesses, although experiencing some negative impacts, including from the supply chain pressures and labor shortages discussed above, have not experienced significant business disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

For additional information related to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

Sales and Customers

We have substantial U.S. government sales, which we conduct through all four of our business segments. RIS and RMD together represent a significant portion of those sales. In addition, as a global company, all four of our business segments have substantial international sales.

U.S. Government Sales. Our U.S. government sales were as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.

International Sales. Our sales to international customers, based on customer end use location, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. See “Note 22: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. 

Backlog. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts).

Total backlog was $156 billion and $150 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Approximately 70% of our consolidated backlog as of December 31, 2021 is not expected to be realized as sales in the next twelve months. 

Defense backlog primarily relates to backlog with government customers and is included within our total backlog. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our defense backlog was approximately 41% and 45%, respectively, of total backlog.

Competition

All of our businesses are subject to significant competition. Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, delivery schedule, past performance, reliability, customer service, product development, innovation and technology. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. Further, some non-U.S. competitors receive government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products beyond the assistance that may be available to us as a U.S. company. In addition, the competitive landscape in the industry segments we serve continues to evolve with trends such as increased vertical integration by competitors and customers and the emergence of more commercial competitors on defense development programs. 

Our aerospace businesses compete with numerous domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Some competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products.

7
Our defense businesses compete with numerous U.S. and foreign companies in most defense and government electronics, space, information technology and technical services and support segments. We frequently partner on defense programs with our major suppliers, some of whom are, from time to time, competitors on other programs. 

People

As a global technology and innovation-driven company, we depend on a highly skilled workforce. Attracting, developing, advancing and retaining the best talent is critical for us to execute our strategy and grow our business. We strive to advance a diverse, equitable and inclusive work environment. Individuals with technical, engineering, and science backgrounds, experience, or interests are particularly important for us to succeed in the industries in which we compete. In 2021, we renamed the compensation committee of the RTC Board of Directors the Human Capital & Compensation Committee and designated the committee to provide oversight of human capital management.

Workforce Demographics. As of December 31, 2021, our global employee population consisted of a total of approximately 174,000 employees, including approximately 58,000 engineers and approximately 30,000 employees represented by labor unions and other employee representative bodies. Our employees are located in 54 countries, with 72% of our employees located in the U.S. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). We believe a work environment where all individuals are respected, valued and supported enables them to focus on developing the most innovative solutions to our industry’s greatest challenges. We have established a DE&I advisory board of senior leaders. We review diversity in talent development and promotion, employee compensation practices and succession planning, and embed DE&I training into our leadership development programs. We have nine diverse employee resource groups. We also invest in a more diverse workforce by supporting science, technology, engineering and mathematics initiatives for women and students of color, and providing opportunities and support to military veterans. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 25% of our global workforce and 30% of our global executives, and people of color represented 31% of our U.S. employee population and 17% of our U.S. executives. In addition, based on those employees who self-identified, veterans represented 12% of our U.S. employee population.

Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention; Employee Health and Safety. We continuously monitor the hiring, retention and management of our employees by business and function with a focus to attract, develop, engage, advance and retain the best talent in the industry. We invest in our workforce through internal and external education, training and development programs and tuition assistance benefits. We also provide market competitive compensation and benefits. We recognize and reward performance during our annual review process. We regularly conduct succession planning to ensure that we continue to cultivate the leadership pipeline of talent needed to execute our business strategy. We solicit employee feedback on RTC’s performance as an employer via confidential surveys in the pre-hire, active and exit stages of employment, and use those results to improve our workplace and employee experience. These surveys cover various topics related to employee engagement and satisfaction. 

We have industry-leading health and safety programs to help maintain a safe work environment for all employees and mitigate workplace incidents, risks and hazards. We review and monitor our performance and encourage employee input to identify opportunities to reduce incidents. Moreover, we have industry-leading ethics and compliance programs to help mitigate associated employee risks. We also provide health and wellness benefits for our employees. We continue to employ safety measures in our facilities in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, require all employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 subject to applicable laws, and continue to enable remote working for those employees who are able. In addition, we are implementing new workplace initiatives to provide our employees with more flexibility, such as different work environment assignments (onsite, remote or hybrid), as appropriate, which will continue after the COVID-19 restrictions ease.

Additional information regarding our human capital strategy is available in our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report that can be found on our company website. Information on our website, including our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. 

For information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

Research and Development and Operations

Our innovative products and services incorporate advanced technologies. As a result, we invest substantial amounts in research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds and under contractual arrangements with our customers, to enhance existing products and services and develop future technologies to meet our customers’ changing needs and requirements, as well as to address new business opportunities. 

We manufacture and service our products in over 235 manufacturing, production or overhaul facilities in approximately 30 countries, including the U.S. In addition, RTC has offices in another 9 countries.

8
Intellectual Property

We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. We rely on a combination of these rights, along with nondisclosure agreements, information technology (IT) security systems, internal controls and compliance systems and other measures to protect our intellectual property. The U.S. government and foreign governments have licenses to certain of our intellectual property, including certain patents, which are developed or used in the performance of government contracts. Commercial customers also have licenses to certain of our intellectual property largely in connection with the sale of our products. While our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.

Suppliers and Raw Materials

We are dependent upon the availability of materials and major components and the performance of our suppliers and subcontractors. Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials. We generally have not experienced significant difficulties in procuring the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to negatively impact the global supply chain, as discussed above. Our inability to procure the necessary raw materials, components and other supplies for our products could negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. In addition, a significant prolonged increase in inflation could negatively impact the cost of materials and components, particularly with respect to our commercial business operations within Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney. We continuously monitor potential supply chain issues and work with our suppliers and subcontractors to mitigate delays in our receipt of necessary raw materials, components and other supplies, and reduce costs, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on global supply chain. In addition, we monitor supplier liquidity and work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating or re-sourcing our purchases, entering long-term agreements, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and competitions among suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. In addition, in some cases, we must comply with specific procurement requirements, which may limit the suppliers and subcontractors we may utilize.

Regulatory Matters

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation in the industries we serve. We deal with numerous U.S. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in all of the countries in which we do business.

U.S. Government Contracts. As previously discussed, the U.S. government is our largest customer, representing a substantial majority of our total defense sales. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for payments made to us for undelivered goods or services, additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Our U.S. government contracts generally are subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which sets forth policies, procedures and requirements for the acquisition of goods and services by the U.S. government; department-specific regulations that implement or supplement the FAR, such as the DoD’s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS); and other applicable laws and regulations. These regulations impose a broad range of requirements, many of which are unique to government contracting, including various procurement, import and export, security, contract pricing and cost, contract termination and adjustment, audit and product integrity requirements. A contractor’s failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions to the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, cash withholds on contract payments, forfeiture of profits, and/or the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines, and could lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.

For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, including on-going litigation associated with U.S. government audits and investigations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

9
Commercial Aerospace Product Regulation. Our commercial aerospace products are subject to regulations by the FAA, foreign aviation administration authorities and international regulatory bodies, including on production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. In addition, commercial aerospace regulations and regulator approaches differ across jurisdictions and changes in such regulations and implementing legislation can impact our operations.

Environmental Regulation. Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We use hazardous substances and generate hazardous wastes in some of our operations and have incurred, and will likely continue to incur, costs associated with environmental compliance activities and management of remediation matters at sites with pollutants. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, also known as the Superfund law, or state law counterparts to the Superfund law, for a number of sites. The nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. We also manage various government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs have historically been primarily the responsibility of the U.S. government, and we have relied (and continue to rely consistent with best practices) upon the U.S. government funding to pay such costs. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions or requirements relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 19: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected. In addition, we could be affected by future foreign or domestic laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investment in product designs and could increase environmental compliance expenditures, including increased energy and raw materials costs. 

For further discussion of risks related to environmental and climate matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.

Other Applicable Regulations. We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. As a result, our businesses and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export controls, tariffs, taxes, investment, exchange controls, anti-corruption, and cash repatriation. Our international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.
