PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

V.F. Corporation, founded in 1899, is one of the world's largest apparel, footwear and accessories companies connecting people to the lifestyles, activities and experiences they cherish most through a family of iconic outdoor, active and workwear brands. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “VF,” the "Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to V.F. Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. All references to "Fiscal 2022" relate to VF's current fiscal year which ran from April 4, 2021 through April 2, 2022.

Unless otherwise noted, all discussion below, including amounts and percentages for all periods, reflect the results of operations and financial condition of VF’s continuing operations. As such, both the Occupational Workwear business that was sold on June 28, 2021 and the Jeans business subject to the spin-off completed May 22, 2019, have been excluded.

VF’s diverse portfolio meets consumer needs across a broad spectrum of activities and lifestyles. Our ability to connect with consumers, as diverse as our brand portfolio, creates a unique platform for sustainable, long-term growth. Our long-term growth strategy is focused on four strategic choices:

•Drive and optimize our portfolio. Investing in our brands to realize their full potential, while ensuring the composition of our portfolio positions us to win in evolving market conditions;

•Distort investments to Asia, with a heightened focus towards China. Investing in and scaling our business across the Asia-Pacific region, especially China, to unlock growth opportunities for our brands in this fast-growing region;

•Elevate direct channels. Investing in our direct-to-consumer business to make it the pinnacle expression of our brands, and prioritizing serving consumers through e-commerce and digitally enabled transactions; and,

•Accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation. Becoming consumer- and retail-centric to meet and exceed consumers' needs across all channels, and operate our business differently - from the design studio to the factory floor to the point of sale - by thinking and acting more like a vertically integrated manufacturer and retailer.

VF is diversified across brands, product categories, channels of distribution, geographies and consumer demographics. We own a broad portfolio of brands in the outerwear, footwear, apparel, backpack, luggage and accessories categories. Our largest brands are Vans®, The North Face®, Timberland® and Dickies®. 

Our products are marketed to consumers through our wholesale channel, primarily in specialty stores, national chains, mass merchants, department stores, independently-operated partnership stores and with strategic digital partners. Our products are also marketed to consumers through our own direct-to-consumer operations, which include VF-operated stores, concession retail stores, brand e-commerce sites and other digital platforms. Revenues from the direct-to-consumer business represented 46% of VF’s total Fiscal 2022 revenues. In addition to selling directly into international markets, many of our brands also sell products through licensees, agents and distributors. In Fiscal 2022, VF derived 57% of its revenues from the Americas, 29% from Europe and 14% from Asia-Pacific.

To provide diversified products across multiple channels of distribution in different geographic areas, we rely on our global sourcing of finished goods from independent contractors. We utilize state-of-the-art supply chain technologies for inventory replenishment that enable us to effectively and efficiently match our assortment of products to consumer demand.

VF's chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based on a global brand view which represents VF's operating segments. Global brands have been combined into reportable segments based on similar economic characteristics and qualitative factors. The reportable segments for financial reporting purposes have been identified as: Outdoor, Active and Work.

WORK SEGMENT

Our Work segment consists of work and work-inspired lifestyle brands with product offerings that include apparel, footwear and accessories.

Dickies® is the largest brand in our Work segment. The Dickies® brand is a leader in authentic, functional, durable and affordable workwear and has expanded to produce work-inspired, casual-use products.

Timberland PRO® products are also available in most U.S. VF-operated Timberland® stores.

We believe there is a strategic opportunity for growth in our Work segment in both existing and future markets, and in all channels and geographies. We expect growth will be driven by an increased presence in the retail workwear market, additional work-inspired lifestyle product offerings and by continuing to innovate products that address workers’ desires for increased comfort and performance.

DIRECT-TO-CONSUMER OPERATIONS

Our direct-to-consumer business includes VF-operated retail stores, brand e-commerce sites, concession retail locations and other digital platforms. Direct-to-consumer revenues were 46% of total VF revenues in Fiscal 2022.

Our full-price retail stores allow us to display a brand’s full line of products with fixtures and imagery that support the brand’s positioning and promise to consumers. These experiences provide high visibility for our brands and products and enable us to stay close to the needs and preferences of our consumers. The complete and impactful presentation of products in our stores also helps to increase sell-through of VF products at our wholesale customers due to increased brand awareness, education and visibility. VF-operated full-price stores generally provide gross margins that are well above VF averages.

In addition, VF operates outlet stores in both premium outlet malls and more traditional value-based locations. These outlet stores carry merchandise that is specifically designed for sale in our outlet stores and serve an important role in our overall inventory management and profitability by allowing VF to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season products at better prices than otherwise available from outside parties, while maintaining the integrity of our brands.

Our global direct-to-consumer operations included 1,322 stores at the end of Fiscal 2022. We operate retail store locations for the following brands: Vans®, The North Face®, Timberland®, Kipling®, Dickies®, Icebreaker®, Napapijri® and Supreme®. Approximately 57% of our stores are located in the Americas (50% in the U.S.), 26% in Europe and 17% in Asia-Pacific. Additionally, we sell certain of our branded products through approximately 900 concession retail stores located principally in 

VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 3
Europe and Asia. During Fiscal 2022, VF-operated retail stores across the globe remained open for the majority of the year. However, at varying times during the year, VF experienced temporary closures in response to the coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic. Closures were based on guidance from health advisors and governmental actions and regulations. Overall, VF-operated retail store closures were less significant in Fiscal 2022 when compared to Fiscal 2021.

E-commerce represented approximately 44% of our direct-to-consumer business and 20% of total VF revenues in Fiscal 2022. All VF brands are marketed online. We continue to expand our e-commerce initiatives by rolling out additional, country-specific brand sites in Europe and Asia, which enhances our ability to deliver a superior, localized consumer experience. We also continue to increase focus on digital innovation and growth across other third-party digital platforms that are reported 

within our direct-to-consumer business. Changes in the retail landscape resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of our e-commerce platform resulting in levels well above periods prior to COVID-19.

We expect our direct-to-consumer business to continue to gain share in our revenue mix as we accelerate our consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital business model transformation.

In addition to our direct-to-consumer operations, independent parties own and operate approximately 2,700 partnership stores. These are primarily mono-brand retail locations selling VF products that have the appearance of VF-operated stores. Most of these partnership stores are located in Europe and in Asia, and are concentrated amongst the Timberland®, The North Face®, Vans®, Dickies®, Kipling® and Napapijri® brands.

LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our strategy of expanding market penetration of VF-owned brands, we enter into licensing agreements with independent parties for specific apparel and complementary product categories when such arrangements provide more effective sourcing, distribution and marketing than could be achieved internally. We provide support to these business partners and ensure the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of licensed products.

Licensing arrangements relate to a broad range of VF brands and are for fixed terms of generally 3 to 5 years, with conditional renewal options, outside of certain licensing arrangements for the Dickies® brand that have longer terms. Each licensee pays royalties to VF based on its sales of licensed products, with most agreements providing for a minimum royalty requirement. Royalties generally range from 4% to 10% of the licensing partners’ net licensed product sales. Royalty income was $66.6 million in Fiscal 2022 (less than 1% of total revenues), primarily from the Dickies®, Vans® and Timberland® brands.

SOURCING AND DISTRIBUTION

Product design and innovation, including fit, fabric, finish and quality, are important elements across our businesses. These functions are performed by employees located in our global supply chain organization and our branded business units across the globe.

VF’s centralized global supply chain organization is responsible for procuring and delivering products to support our brands and businesses. VF is highly skilled in managing the complexities associated with our global supply chain. In Fiscal 2022, VF sourced approximately 408 million units spread across our brands. Our products were primarily obtained from approximately 252 independent contractor manufacturing facilities in approximately 37 countries. Additionally, we operate 25 distribution centers and 1,322 retail stores. Managing this complexity is made possible by the use of a network of information systems for product development, forecasting, order management and warehouse management, along with our core enterprise resource management platforms.

Products obtained from contractors in the Western Hemisphere generally have a higher cost than products obtained from contractors in Asia. However, contracting in the Western Hemisphere gives us greater flexibility, shorter lead times and allows for lower inventory levels for the U.S. market. The use of contracted production with different geographic regions and cost structures, provides a flexible approach to product sourcing. We will continue to manage our supply chain from a global perspective and adjust as needed to changes in the global production environment.

Independent contractors generally own the raw materials and ship finished, ready-for-sale products to VF. These contractors are engaged through VF sourcing hubs in Singapore (with satellite offices across Asia) and Panama. These hubs are responsible for managing the procurement of product, supplier oversight, product quality assurance, sustainability within the supply chain, responsible sourcing and transportation and shipping functions. In addition, our hubs leverage proprietary knowledge and technology to enable certain contractors to more effectively control costs and improve labor efficiency. 

Management continually monitors political risks and developments related to duties, tariffs and quotas. We limit VF’s sourcing exposure through, among other measures: (i) diversifying production among countries and contractors, (ii) sourcing production to merchandise categories where product is readily available, and (iii) sourcing from countries with tariff preference and free trade agreements. VF does not directly or indirectly source products from suppliers in countries that are prohibited by the U.S. State Department.

No single supplier represented more than 7% of our total cost of goods sold during Fiscal 2022.

All independent contractor facilities that manufacture VF products, must comply with VF’s Global Compliance Principles. These principles, consistent with international labor standards, are a set of strict standards covering legal and ethical business practices, worker age, work hours, health and safety conditions, environmental standards and compliance with local laws and regulations.

4 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K
VF, through its contractor monitoring program, audits the activities of the independent businesses and contractors that produce VF products at locations across the globe. Each of the approximately 252 independent contractor facilities, including those serving our independent licensees, must be pre-certified before producing VF products. This pre-certification includes passing a factory inspection and signing a VF Terms of Engagement agreement. We maintain an ongoing audit program to ensure compliance with these requirements by using dedicated internal staff and externally contracted firms. Additional information about VF’s Code of Business Conduct, Global Compliance Principles, Terms of Engagement and Environmental Compliance Guidelines, along with a Global Compliance Report, is available on the VF website at www.vfc.com.

COVID-19 has impacted some of VF's suppliers, including the resurgence of COVID-19 lockdowns in key sourcing countries that resulted in additional manufacturing constraints during Fiscal 2022; however, this situation has improved over time. Additionally, Fiscal 2022 was impacted by continued port congestion, lengthened transit times, equipment availability and other logistics challenges. These issues have caused significant product delays, which have resulted in challenges to timely meet 

customer demand in Fiscal 2022; however, VF has actively worked with its suppliers to minimize disruption. VF has and will continue to work to offset any increases in product costs through (i) the continuing shift in the mix of its business to higher margin brands, geographies and channels of distribution, (ii) increases in the prices of its products, and (iii) cost reduction efforts. The loss of any one supplier or contractor would not have a significant adverse effect on our business.

Product is shipped from our independent suppliers to distribution centers around the world. In some instances, product is shipped directly to our customers. Most distribution centers are operated by VF, and most support more than one brand. In response to COVID-19, VF's distribution centers have maintained operations in accordance with local government guidelines while maintaining enhanced health and safety protocols. 

Our largest distribution centers by region are located in Visalia, California, Prague, Czech Republic and Shanghai, China. In total, we operate 25 owned or leased distribution centers primarily in the U.S., but also in the Czech Republic, United Kingdom, the Netherlands, China, Canada, Mexico, Belgium, Israel, Japan and France.

SEASONALITY

VF’s quarterly operating results vary due to the seasonality of our individual brands, and are historically stronger in the second half of the calendar year. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor segment, where revenues are historically weighted towards the second and third fiscal quarters. On a quarterly basis in Fiscal 2022, revenues ranged from a low of 19% of full year revenues in the first fiscal quarter to a high of 31% in the third fiscal quarter, while operating margin was 9% in the first fiscal quarter and 19% in the third fiscal quarter. This variation results primarily from the seasonal influences on revenues of our Outdoor segment, where 12% of the segment's revenues occurred in the first fiscal quarter compared to 36% in the third fiscal quarter of 

Fiscal 2022. With changes in our mix of business and the growth of our retail operations, historical quarterly revenue and profit trends may not be indicative of future trends.

Working capital requirements vary throughout the year. Working capital typically increases early in the calendar year as inventory builds to support peak shipping periods and then moderates later in the year as those inventories are sold and accounts receivable are collected. Historically, cash provided by operating activities is substantially higher in the second half of the calendar year due to higher net income during that period and reduced working capital requirements, particularly during the fourth quarter of the calendar year.

ADVERTISING, CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH

During Fiscal 2022, our advertising and promotion expense was $840.6 million, representing 7% of total revenues. We advertise in consumer and trade publications and through digital initiatives, including social media and mobile platforms on the Internet. We also participate in cooperative advertising on a shared cost basis with major retailers in print and digital media, radio and television. We sponsor sporting, musical and special events, as well as athletes and personalities who promote our products. We employ marketing sciences to optimize the impact of advertising and promotional spending, and to identify the types of spending that provide the greatest return on our marketing investments.

We provide advertising support to our wholesale customers, including independent partnership stores, in the form of point-of-sale fixtures and signage to enhance the presentation and brand image of our products. We also participate in shop-in-shops and concession retail arrangements, which are separate sales areas dedicated to a specific VF brand within our customers' stores and other locations, to help differentiate and enhance the presentation of our products.

We contribute to incentive programs with our wholesale customers, including cooperative advertising funds, discounts and allowances. We also offer sales incentive programs directly to consumers in the form of discounts, rebates and coupon offers that are eligible for use in certain VF-operated stores, brand e-commerce sites and concession retail locations. VF also offers loyalty programs for certain brands that provide a range of benefits to consumers.

In addition to sponsorships and activities that directly benefit our products and brands, VF and its associates actively support our communities and various charities. For example, The North Face® brand has committed to programs that encourage and enable outdoor participation, such as The North Face Explore Fund™ program. The Timberland® brand has a strong heritage of volunteerism, including the Path of Service™ program that offers full-time employees paid time off to serve their local communities through global service events such as Earth Day in the spring and "Serv-a-palooza" in the fall. In Fiscal 2022, the Vans® brand launched "Checkerboard Day", the brand's single largest philanthropic initiative, supporting charities from around the world who share a mission of revitalizing public spaces through arts, sports, culture and social impact programming.

SUSTAINABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY

VF and our family of brands strive to be more than just an apparel and footwear company. Collectively, we work to be a leading global citizen, setting a high bar for corporate sustainability and responsibility. Our enterprise-wide sustainability and responsibility strategy, entitled Made for Change, focuses on key areas including people, the planet and our products.

People

•VF is a people-focused company. Our associates are a force for good in the world, sparking global movements that genuinely make a difference. We have a responsibility to protect and lift-up all who work across our operations and supply chain.

Planet

•The well-being of people and the planet are inextricably connected. Through our sustainability efforts, we are taking bold action on climate change to protect the planet for generations to come.

Product

•VF brands touch millions of lives every year – from the people that design and make apparel and footwear to the consumers who purchase them. Innovation and responsible product stewardship is infused at every step.

VF prioritizes sustainable materials, circularity, and sustainable packaging to drive scalable change by working to reduce our environmental impact. Other critical components of our sustainability strategy include reducing greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, renewable energy use, responsible sourcing of materials, reducing waste and implementing green buildings across both our operations and supply chain.

VF’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the Company's Executive Leadership Team and Board of Directors are responsible for the oversight of VF’s sustainability and responsibility strategies and targets. Progress updates are presented to the Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of the Board of Directors on a biannual cadence.

In alignment with the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures ("TCFD"), VF has completed an analysis of potential climate-related risks and opportunities. 'Climate Change & Environmental Sustainability' has been established as a VF enterprise risk and embedded in our enterprise risk management framework. Updates on enterprise risks, and progress towards associated targets, are provided to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors quarterly.

VF's science-based targets include the following:

•Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 55% by 2030 from a 2017 baseline; and

•Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services and upstream transportation 30% by 2030 from a 2017 baseline.

Other planet- and product-related goals include the following:

•Utilize 100% renewable energy across our owned-and-operated facilities by Fiscal 2026, to be primarily achieved through off-site renewable energy investments, including renewable energy credits.

•Source 50% of our polyester from recycled materials by Fiscal 2026.

•Eliminate all non-essential, single-use plastics from VF direct operations and sponsored events by Fiscal 2024.

VF is currently on course with its internal milestones, tracking progress towards these targets and goals.

Additional information regarding VF’s sustainability and responsibility strategy and actions can be found within our latest Made for Change report within our “Responsibility” page on www.vfc.com. Also included on that webpage are downloads of our Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") and Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") indices. Information contained on our website or in our Made for Change report or related supplemental information is not incorporated by reference into this or any other report we file with the SEC.

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

As a purpose-led, performance-driven company, VF leverages the strength of our business and the capabilities of our people to drive profitable growth and create value for shareholders and stakeholders. Our purpose is to power movements of sustainable and active lifestyles for the betterment of people and our planet. This purpose, combined with a laser focus on performance and delivering on our commitments, allows us to offer a unique value proposition to our associates – a place where you can do well and do good at the same time.

We consider the talent and capabilities of our people as essential to our business strategy and execution, and, as such, put in place strategies to attract, develop and retain highly diverse talent with the skills and passion to build our brands for our consumers around the globe. Our Human Capital Management ("HCM") practices are designed to promote inclusion, diversity and equity; provide development opportunities for associates across the organization; offer competitive rewards and benefits; 

and sponsor programs that support wellbeing in an engaging work environment built on enduring guiding principles and longstanding values. 

We believe that having an engaged, diverse and committed workforce not only enhances our business performance but also our culture. Initiatives to promote overall alignment with our performance, purpose, guiding principles, and strategy are therefore important and include internal communications and education about our programs, townhalls across various parts of our business, and a listening strategy that engages associates in providing input and feedback on a variety of topics.

Our Board of Directors and its Committees provide governance and oversight on a broad range of VF’s human capital management efforts. The Board’s oversight includes review of CEO and executive officer performance, compensation and succession planning and inclusion, and diversity and belonging 

6 VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K
programs and initiatives. The Talent and Compensation Committee works with management on executive compensation and compensation risks, and regularly reviews our progress on company-wide HCM priorities, including inclusion and diversity, benefits, wellbeing, culture, succession and talent development strategies. VF’s Audit Committee monitors current and emerging risks, including HCM risks, and VF’s health and safety program. The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for conducting Board succession planning and the selection of nominees to the Board, and reviews VF’s Code of Business Conduct and VF’s sustainability policies, goals and programs. These Committees provide recommendations to the Board and are part of the broader framework that guides how VF attracts, develops, and retains a workforce that aligns with VF’s values and supports its business strategies and performance objectives. In addition, VF’s Executive Leadership Team is regularly engaged in the development and management of key talent systems, guiding our culture, employee value proposition and talent development programs. The sections that follow provide further background on our associate base, as well as examples of our key programs and initiatives that are focused on the achievement of our objectives.

Associate Base

VF had approximately 35,000 employees at the end of Fiscal 2022. Of VF’s total employees, approximately 58% were full-time and approximately 58% were located in the U.S. In international markets, certain employees are covered by trade-sponsored or governmental bargaining arrangements. Employee relations are considered to be good. 

Inclusion, Diversity, Equity, Action ("IDEA")

IDEA is fundamental to our business as we aim to sustain a workplace that celebrates the diversity of our associates. We strive to provide an environment that allows our associates to bring their authentic selves to work every day, and we’re determined to foster a workplace that is free of discrimination and harassment, and promotes allyship, advocacy and belonging. Our Global Inclusion, Diversity and Equity Council sets global goals and strategic direction in alignment with VF’s global IDEA strategy. Our Council to Advance Racial Equity (“CARE”) oversees our commitments on actions that promote: increasing Black, Indigenous and People of Color (“BIPOC”) representation at the director and above population in the U.S.; diverse candidate slates; pay equity; leader compensation tied to successful implementation of our IDEA strategy; mentorship and sponsorship of BIPOC employees and members of the community; and elevating our commitment to education, listening and learning. 

These actions are consistent and aligned with VF’s IDEA Statement, committing to equal opportunity for all employees and candidates. At the end of Fiscal 2022, approximately 18% of our U.S. director and above workforce voluntarily self-identified as BIPOC. 

VF is a member of the Paradigm for Parity coalition, which has pledged to promote organizational gender parity globally in leadership roles by 2030. At the end of Fiscal 2022, approximately 53% of the overall VF workforce and approximately 42% of director and above roles voluntarily self-identified as women. VF aims to remove barriers to uplifting women and has added and expanded resources to support women in the workplace, including career advancement 

workshops, community building activities through our Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), and a suite of benefits designed to promote wellbeing and provide support for parents and families, including paid parental leave. 

Our dedication to inclusion and diversity is further reflected in programs sponsored by our ERGs. Our ERGs enhance our culture of belonging by creating a safe space for learning and dialogue for underrepresented groups, establishing a sense of community among associates and providing platforms to collect and share insights to support business imperatives. We currently have various ERGs for women, BIPOC, Veterans and LGBTQ+ communities. VF is committed to maximizing inclusion, diversity and equity not only within the company, but within the communities where we live and work, while also being a positive influence within the apparel and footwear sector, and society at large.

Culture and Engagement

Our culture is built on our five Guiding Principles: Live with Integrity, Act with Empathy, Be Curious, Persevere, and Act Courageously. We have codified this culture through the lens of “what we do”, “what we see” and “how we feel”, and we measure our culture and Employee Net Promoter Score ("eNPS") via semiannual surveys. Results are evaluated, shared with associates and used to guide management focus and attention. Recent actions have included our Workplace Next initiative, which is focused on 1) driving flexibility for associates where they work, 2) creating engaging work environments that bring associates together to collaborate and innovate, and 3) equipping leaders to manage in a complex, hybrid environment. VF also conducts periodic pulse check surveys for interim feedback on specific topics such as ethics and compliance, safety, communications, and related topics.

Talent Management 

Talent Management includes the acquisition, development, skilling and upskilling, and deployment of our talent. We utilize a range of tools and programs including diverse candidate slates, talent reviews, performance coaching and development, succession planning, access to volunteering opportunities, IDEA training and hundreds of online learning modules that are available to all associates. We also have an active internal mobility program, with approximately 31% of our office associates taking on larger or new responsibilities within the company in the last year, and hundreds contributing their skills through short-term assignments or “gigs” across the organization.

Associate Wellbeing and Safety

VF endeavors to support the diverse wellbeing needs of our associates and their families. We define wellbeing as not only physical health, but also emotional, social, financial and career wellbeing. We offer a comprehensive and competitive benefits program to our full-time associates that is designed to provide choices and flexibility to meet their needs now and in the future. These include health and welfare programs, retirement programs, paid parental leave, reproductive and adoption assistance, paid time off, tuition reimbursement, product discounts, fitness facilities or programs, childcare and educational resources and various on-site services, employee assistance program, and regular wellbeing programming, as 

VF Corporation Fiscal 2022 Form 10-K 7
culturally appropriate throughout the geographies in which we operate.

Associate safety rests at the heart of our decisions. Nothing is more fundamental than providing people with an environment where they feel safe, secure and supported. Our mission is simple: Foster a culture of safety that enables a workplace free of hazards and sends every employee home safely. Our goal is zero workplace injuries within our operations. We’re using our scale, influence and insight to help establish safe, stable working environments in the factories producing our products, while simultaneously improving the lives of those in local communities beyond the factory walls.

Ethics and Compliance

VF’s Code of Business Conduct sets forth business policies and principles for all directors, officers and associates of VF. The key principles of our code are as follows: we will lead with integrity; we will treat everyone with dignity and respect; we will compete fairly and honestly; we will follow the law everywhere we do business; and we will strive to make our communities better. Our global Ethics and Compliance program provides VF associates with the tools they need to understand our expectations for ethical business conduct and the courage to speak up and raise concerns without fear of retaliation.

OTHER MATTERS

Competitive Factors

Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer demand for VF’s brands and products. VF is well-positioned to compete in the apparel, footwear and accessories sector by developing high quality, innovative products at competitive prices that meet consumer needs, providing high service levels, ensuring the right products are on the retail sales floor to meet consumer demand, investing significant amounts into existing brands and managing our brand portfolio through acquisitions and dispositions. Many of VF’s brands have long histories and enjoy strong recognition within their respective consumer segments.

Intellectual Property
