Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of Welltower Inc. presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in “Item 1 — Business” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above.

Executive Summary

Company Overview

Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The Company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower™, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (U.S.), Canada and the United Kingdom (U.K.), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. 

The following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Represents consolidated net operating income ("NOI") and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliation.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our operators and tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccines, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, the overall pace of recovery, among others. 

Our Seniors Housing Operating revenues are dependent on occupancy. Spot occupancy has steadily increased in recent months, with 94% of communities open for new admissions and nearly all communities allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining and activities as of December 31, 2021. Rapid distribution and a high acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccinations by residents within assisted living and memory care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. have resulted in a significant decrease in total resident case counts across the portfolio from peak levels in mid-January 2021, however, resident case counts have increased in December 2021 as a result of highly transmissible variants.

We have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor, personal protective equipment and sanitation. We expect total Seniors Housing Operating expenses to remain elevated during the pandemic and potentially beyond as these additional health and safety measures become standard practice.

Our Triple-net operators are experiencing similar trends related to occupancy and operating costs as described above with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. However, long-term/post-acute care facilities are generally experiencing a higher degree of occupancy declines. These factors may continue to impact the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us in the future. Many of our Triple-net operators received funds under the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) Paycheck Protection Program and Provider Relief Fund. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected approximately 94% of rent due from operators under Triple-net lease agreements (primarily seniors housing and post-acute care facilities). No significant rent deferrals or rent concessions have been made during the year ended December 31, 2021. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable. To the extent the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic causes operators or tenants to seek further modifications of their lease agreements, we may recognize reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables.

During the early stages of the pandemic in 2020, our Outpatient Medical tenants experienced temporary medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government-imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures, stay at home orders or decisions by patients to delay treatments. In some instances, these factors caused tenants to seek modifications of contractual 

46

rent obligations. We evaluated each request on a case-by-case basis to determine if a form of rent relief was warranted following an examination of the tenant's financial health, rent coverage, current operating situation and other factors. Virtually all deferred rent related to 2020 deferrals has been paid. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we have continued to collect virtually all rent due from tenants in our Outpatient Medical portfolio, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with COVID-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants.

Business Strategy

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in NOI and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, resident fees and services and rental income represented 67% and 29%, respectively, of total revenues. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.

Our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.

We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from NOI and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. At December 31, 2021, we had $269,265,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $77,490,000 of restricted cash and $3,675,000,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.

48

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Operating Performance We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”) per the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and consolidated net operating income (“NOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Credit Strength  We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest and secured debt principal amortization). We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Concentration Risk  We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our various property types. Relationship mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five relationships. Geographic mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five states (or international equivalents). The following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by NOI for the years indicated below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities and non-segment/corporate NOI. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.

(2) Revera owns a controlling interest in Sunrise Senior Living.

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in “Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to “Item 1 — Business,” “Item 1A — Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.

Corporate Governance

Maintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today’s business environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities  The changes in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to declines in revenue as a result of decreased occupancy at our Seniors Housing Operating properties, straight-line receivable reserves related to Triple-net leases during the year ended December 31, 2021 and dispositions. Please see “Results of Operations” for discussion of net income fluctuations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.

Investing Activities The changes in net cash provided from/used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments and dispositions, loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 3 and 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

50

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization. 

Financing Activities  The changes in net cash provided from/used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuances of common stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 10, 11 and 14 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

In March 2021, we completed the issuance of $750,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of June 2031. In June 2021, we completed the issuance of $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of January 2029. Net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to redeem the remaining $339,128,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023, $334,624,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023, and $860,000,000 remaining on our term loan due April 2022. In June 2021, we closed on a new $4,700,000,000 unsecured credit facility. The credit facility includes $4,000,000,000 of revolving credit capacity. In November 2021, we completed the issuance of $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of January 2032. As of December 31, 2021, we have total near-term available liquidity of approximately $4.0 billion. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2021, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 65%. We use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. At December 31, 2021, we had 15 outstanding letter of credit obligations. Please see Notes 8, 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Contractual Obligations

(3) Based on variable interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021.

(4) See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(5) See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Capital Structure

Please refer to “Credit Strength” above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

On May 4, 2021, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (1) an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units to replace our existing “universal” shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 17, 2018, and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock to replace our existing DRIP registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on May 17, 2018. As of February 4, 2022, 15,000,000 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration statement. On July 30, 2021, we entered into (i) an amended and restated equity distribution agreement (the “EDA”) with each of Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Securities, Inc., Capital One Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Comerica Securities, Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Fifth Third Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co.

The ATM Program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements. As of February 4, 2022, we had $1,876,085,000 of remaining capacity under the ATM Program, which excludes forward sales agreements outstanding for the sale of 10,924,956 shares or approximately $930,610,000 with maturity dates in 2022. We expect to physically settle the forward sales for cash proceeds. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.

In connection with the filing of the new “universal” shelf registration statement, the Company also filed with the SEC two prospectus supplements that will continue offerings that were previously covered by prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus to the prior registration statement relating to: (i) the registration and possible issuance of up to 620,731 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “DownREIT Shares”), that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the “DownREIT Units”) of HCN G&L DownREIT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “DownREIT”), tender such DownREIT Units for redemption by the DownREIT, and HCN DownREIT Member, LLC, a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (including its permitted successors and assigns, the “Managing Member”), or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount; and (ii) the registration and possible issuance of up to 475,327 shares common stock (the “DownREIT II Shares”), that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the “DownREIT II Units,” and collectively with the DownREIT Units, the “Units”) of HCN G&L DownREIT II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “DownREIT II”), tender such DownREIT II Units for redemption by the DownREIT II, and the Managing Member, or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT II and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT II Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount. 

Results of Operations

Summary

Our primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services, rent and interest income. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, and other expenses. We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and same store NOI (SSNOI) and other supplemental measures include FFO and Adjusted EBITDA, which are further discussed below. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations related to these supplemental measures. 

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

Resident fees and services and property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, including the acquisition of the Holiday Retirement portfolio on July 30, 2021 for a total purchase price of $1.6 billion. The increases were partially offset by decreases in spot occupancy across the portfolio due to the COVID-19 pandemic and property dispositions. Spot occupancy remains below pre-pandemic levels but has steadily increased in recent months, with 94% of communities open for new admissions and nearly all communities allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining and activities as of December 31, 2021. Rapid distribution and a high acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccinations by residents within assisted living and memory care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. have resulted in a significant decrease in total resident case counts across the portfolio from peak levels in mid-January 2021, however, resident case counts have increased in December 2021 as a result of highly transmissible variants. As of December 31, 2021, occupancy has increased approximately 510 bps to 77.7% since the pandemic-low of 72.6% on March 12, 2021. Quarterly spot occupancy rates through December 31, 2021 are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Spot occupancy represents approximate month end occupancy at our share for 546 properties in operation as of December 31, 2020, including unconsolidated properties but excluding acquisitions, executed dispositions, development conversions and one property closed for redevelopment.

(2) Sequential occupancy changes are based on actual spot occupancy and may not recalculate due to rounding.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the U.S. and U.K. portfolios reported spot occupancy gains of approximately 490 bps and 80 bps, respectively. Canada reported a spot occupancy decline of approximately 290 bps.

On March 27, 2020, the federal government enacted CARES Act to provide financial aid to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received government grants under the CARES Act primarily to cover increased expenses and lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as under similar programs in the U.K. and Canada. Grant income is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with all conditions attached to the grant. Additionally, grants are recognized over the periods in which the Company recognizes the increased expenses and lost revenue the grants are intended to defray. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recognized $97,933,000 and $31,927,000, respectively, of government grant income as a reduction to property operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $4,642,000 and $3,014,000, respectively, of government grant income in other income. The amount of qualifying expenditures and lost revenue exceeded grant income recognized and the Company believes it has complied and will continue to comply with all grant conditions.

Property-level operating expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic relating to our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio totaled $63,681,000 and $110,719,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenses were incurred as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure personal protective equipment ("PPE") and supplies, net of reimbursements. Specifically in 2021, we incurred elevated labor expenses resulting from the increased utilization of contract labor due to the rise in occupancy and a challenging labor market. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $22,317,000 related to two held for use properties in which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $100,741,000 related to 15 held for sale or sold properties and six held for use properties. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of the purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to the timing of noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and operator transitions. Changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a gain on real estate disposition of $312,249,000 related to an 11 property U.S. portfolio. 

Depreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of acquisitions, disposition and transitions. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed two Seniors Housing Operating construction projects representing $117,386,000 or $553,573 per unit. The following is a summary of our consolidated Seniors Housing Operating construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Rental income has increased primarily due to the timing of the establishment of reserves for straight-line rent receivable balances relating to leases for which collection of substantially all contractual lease payments is no longer deemed probable. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded reserves for previously recognized straight-line rent receivables of $49,241,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $146,508,000, which included $91,025,000 related to Genesis Healthcare ("Genesis") whom noted substantial doubt as to their ability to continue as a going concern. 

Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we had ten leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 2.00% to 5.94% in our Triple-net portfolio. Our Triple-net operators are experiencing similar impacts on occupancy and operating costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic as described above with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. However, long-term/post-acute facilities have generally experienced a higher degree of occupancy declines, which in some cases impacted the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us. However, many of our Triple-net operators received funds under the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program and Provider Relief Fund. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected approximately 94% of rent due from operators under Triple-net lease agreements (primarily seniors housing and post-acute care facilities). No significant deferrals or rent concessions have been made. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable.

Depreciation and amortization fluctuate as a result of the acquisitions, dispositions and transitions of triple-net properties. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a provision for loan losses under the current expected credit losses accounting standard, primarily related to the initial recognition of the £540 million of senior loan financings to affiliates of Safanad as part of the recapitalization of its investment in HC-One Group during the second quarter. The increase to interest income is primarily driven by interest recognized on this loan funding. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a provision for loan losses of $90,563,000, of which $80,873,000 represents additional reserves as a result of the current collateral estimate related to the Genesis outstanding loans. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $26,579,000 related to four held for sale or sold properties and two held for use properties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $34,867,000 related to one held for sale and four held for use properties. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions and segment transitions. Changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices. 

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed one Triple-net construction project representing $22,990,000 or $280,366 per unit. The following is a summary of our consolidated Triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):

During the year ended December 31, 2021, loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market of the equity warrants received as part of the Safanad/HC-One transaction that closed in the second quarter. In addition, the mark-to-market adjustment on our Genesis available-for-sale investment is reflected in all periods.

Interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations.

Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. The increase in income from unconsolidated entities during the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to the reserves established on straight-line rent receivable balances at unconsolidated Genesis entities in the prior year. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Rental income has decreased due primarily to significant dispositions that closed during 2020. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the Consumer Price Index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our consolidated Outpatient Medical portfolio signed 143,266 square feet of new leases and 203,285 square feet of renewals. The weighted-average term of these leases was seven years, with a rate of $36.65 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $51.78 per square foot. Substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 1.0% to 10.0%. 

We have collected virtually all rent due through the year ended December 31, 2021, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with COVID-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable.

The increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 is due primarily to a $178,207,000 first mortgage initiated in August 2020, which was subsequently repaid in full in June of 2021, resulting in the reversal of the previously established allowance for credit losses.

The fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to the significant dispositions that occurred in 2020. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $2,211,000 related to one held for sale property. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs. Changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed three Outpatient Medical construction projects representing $125,179,000 or $605 per square foot.

The change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, as well as the movement in foreign exchange rates and related hedge activity. Please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. The loss on extinguishment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 is due primarily to the early extinguishment of $339,128,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due March 2023 and $334,624,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due September 2023. The loss on extinguishment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 is due primarily to the early extinguishment of $160,872,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due March 2023 and $265,376,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due September 2023. 

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 2.67%, 2.79% and 2.47%, respectively. Other expenses for all years include severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees. The provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as TRSs. 

Other

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to 

61

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.

NOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (“SSNOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. We believe the drivers of property level NOI for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate SSNOI based on our ownership interest in each property ("Welltower Share"). To arrive at Welltower's Share, NOI is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. We do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at Welltower Share to be useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in SSNOI five full quarters or eight full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the QTD Pool and the YTD Pool, respectively. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from SSNOI. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the transition for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and U.K. properties using a consistent exchange rate. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.

EBITDA is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/loss/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments as deemed appropriate. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. Covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that is specific to those agreements. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. 

Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.

Critical Accounting Policies & Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Management considers an accounting estimate or assumption critical if:

•the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and

•the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. However, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following table presents information about our critical accounting policies and estimates:

Nature of Critical

Accounting EstimateAssumptions/Approach

Used

Impairment of Real Property

Assessing impairment of real property involves subjectivity in determining if indicators of impairment are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset. In estimating the undiscounted cash flows or fair value, key assumptions that would be made are the estimation of future rental revenues, operating expenses, capitalization rates and the ability and intent to hold the respective asset, all of which are affected by our expectations of future market or economic conditions. These estimates can have a significant impact on the undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair value of an asset.

Quarterly, we evaluate our real estate investments on a property by property basis to determine if there are indicators of impairment. These indicators may include expected operational performance, the tenant's ability to make rent payments, a decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and changes in the market that may permanently reduce the value of the property. If indicators of impairment exist, an undiscounted cash flow analysis will be prepared and the results of such analysis will be compared to the current net book value to determine if an impairment charge is necessary. This analysis requires us to use judgment in determining whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate the expected future undiscounted cash flows or estimated fair values of the property. Properties that meet the held for sale criteria are recorded at the lesser of the fair value less costs to sell or carrying value.

At December 31, 2021, our net real property owned was approximately $30,695,633,000. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $19,567,000 related to four Triple-net properties and one Outpatient Medical property which were disposed of or classified as held for sale for which the carrying values exceeded the fair values. Additionally, we recorded $31,540,000 of impairment charges related to two Seniors Housing Operating properties and two Triple-net properties that were held for use in which the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values.

Real Estate Acquisitions

We believe that substantially all of our real estate acquisitions are considered asset acquisitions for which we record the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities) at cost on a relative fair value basis. Liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. Tangible assets consist primarily of land, building and improvements. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities primarily consist of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant's lease and our overall relationship with respect to that tenant. 

The allocation of the purchase price to the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and intangible assets and liabilities) involves subjectivity as such allocations are based on a relative fair value analysis. In determining the fair values that drive such analysis, we estimate the fair value of each component of the real estate acquired which generally includes land, buildings and improvements, the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value of in-place leases. Significant assumptions used to determine such fair values include comparable land sales, capitalization rates, discount rates, market rental rates and property operating data, all of which can be impacted by expectations about future market or economic conditions. Our estimates of the values of these components affect the amount of depreciation and amortization we record over the estimated useful life of the property or the term of the lease.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed $4,084,174,000 of real estate acquisitions. These transactions were accounted for as asset acquisitions and the purchase price of each was allocated based on the relative fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include our accounts, the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and the accounts of joint venture entities in which we own a majority voting interest with the ability to control operations and where no substantive participating rights or substantive kick out rights have been granted to the noncontrolling interests. In addition, we consolidate those entities deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIEs”) in which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

We make judgments about which entities are VIEs based on an assessment of whether (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We make judgments with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are (or are not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors includes, but is not limited to, our ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, our form of ownership interest, our representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of our investment, our ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions, replace the manager and/or liquidate the entity, if applicable. Our ability to correctly assess our influence or control over an entity at inception of our involvement or on a continuous basis when determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE affects the presentation of these entities in our consolidated financial statements. If we perform a primary beneficiary analysis at a date other than at inception of the VIE, our assumptions may be different and may result in the identification of a different primary beneficiary.

Allowance for Credit Losses on Loans Receivable

The allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the credit allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. 

The determination of the allowance for credit losses is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of factors, including, but not limited to, payment status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and nature, extent and value of the underlying collateral. A loan is considered to have deteriorated credit quality when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For those loans we identified as having deteriorated credit quality, we determine the amount of credit loss on an individual basis. Placement on non-accrual status may be required. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual are deemed to have deteriorated credit quality. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we may return these loans to income accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding principal balance. For the remaining loans, we assess credit loss on a collective pool basis and use our historical loss experience for similar loans to determine the reserve for credit losses.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized provision for loan losses of $7,270,000 based on our historical loss experience.
