Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Executive Summary 

As of February 1, 2020, we operated 1,159 Kohl's stores, a website (www.Kohls.com), and 12 FILA outlets. Our Kohl's stores and website sell moderately-priced private and national brand apparel, footwear, accessories, beauty, and home products. Our Kohl's stores generally carry a consistent merchandise assortment with some differences attributable to local preferences. Our website includes merchandise which is available in our stores, as well as merchandise that is available only online.  

Key financial results for 2019 included: 

•  

Net sales decreased 1.5% to $18.9 billion reflecting a 1.3% decrease in our comparable sales which was primarily driven by lower average transaction value. 

•  

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased 64 basis points due to increased promotional markdowns, mix of business, and higher shipping costs resulting from digital sales growth.  

•  

Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&A") as a percentage of total revenue increased 88 basis points. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in store expenses related to the significant number of brand launches, wage rate pressures, costs to support the full rollout of the Amazon Returns program, and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard which resulted in higher rent expense.  

•  

Net income on a GAAP basis was $691 million, or $4.37 per diluted share.  

•  

On an adjusted non-GAAP basis, our net income was $769 million, or $4.86 per diluted share. 

•  

As described in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted ASC 842 Leases (“new lease accounting standard”) in 2019 and prior periods were not restated. 

See "Results of Operations" and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for additional details about our financial results, how we define comparable sales, and a reconciliation of GAAP to Adjusted net income and diluted earnings per share. 

Results of Operations 

Net Sales 

Net sales includes revenue from the sale of merchandise, net of expected returns and shipping revenue. 

Comparable sales is a measure that highlights the performance of our stores and digital channel by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales includes all store and digital sales, except sales from stores open less than 12 months, stores that have been closed, and stores where square footage has changed by more than 10%. We measure the change in digital sales by including all sales initiated online or through mobile applications, including omnichannel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores. 

We measure digital penetration as digital sales over net sales. These amounts do not take into consideration fulfillment node, digital returns processed in stores, and coupon behaviors. 

Comparable sales is a meaningful metric in evaluating our performance of ongoing operations period over period. Comparable sales and digital penetration measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation and digital penetration are non-GAAP measures that may not be consistent with the similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

The following graph summarizes net sales dollars and comparable sales (Dollars in Millions): 

2019 compared to 2018 

Net sales decreased $282 million, or 1.5% to $18.9 billion for 2019.  

•  

The decrease was primarily due to a 1.3% decrease in comparable sales driven by a decrease in average transaction value.  

•  

By line of business, Children’s, Men’s, Accessories, and Footwear outperformed the Company average. Home and Women’s underperformed the Company average.  

•  

Active continued to be a key strategic initiative that contributed to our sales growth in 2019. 

•  

Geographically, the Midwest, Mid-Atlantic, and Northeast outperformed the Company. 

•  

Digital sales had a low double digits percentage increase in 2019. Digital penetration represented 24% of net sales in 2019. 

2018 compared to 2017 

Net sales increased $131 million, or 0.7%, to $19.2 billion for 2018. 

•  

The increase was primarily due to a 1.7% increase in comparable sales driven by an increase in average transaction values, partially offset by $170 million of sales in the 53rd week of 2017. 

•  

By line of business, Men’s, Children’s, and Footwear were the strongest categories. Home and Women’s also reported positive comparable sales. Accessories was slightly negative. 

•  

Geographically, all regions reported higher comparable sales in 2018. 

•  

Digital sales had a low double digits percentage increase in 2018. Digital penetration represented 21% of net sales in 2018. 

Other Revenue 

Other revenue includes revenue from credit card operations, third-party advertising on our website, unused gift cards and merchandise return cards (breakage), and other non-merchandise revenue. 

20 

Table of Contents 

The following graph summarizes other revenue (Dollars in Millions): 

Other revenue increased $27 million in 2019 and $14 million in 2018. The increase in 2019 was due to higher credit card revenue. The increase in 2018 was due to higher credit card revenue, third-party advertising on our website, and breakage. 

Cost of Merchandise Sold and Gross Margin 

Cost of merchandise sold includes the total cost of products sold, including product development costs, net of vendor payments other than reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; inventory shrink; markdowns; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers; shipping expenses for digital sales; terms cash discount; and depreciation of product development facilities and equipment. Our cost of merchandise sold may not be comparable with that of other retailers because we include distribution center and buying costs in selling, general and administrative expenses while other retailers may include these expenses in cost of merchandise sold. 

The following graph summarizes cost of merchandise sold and gross margin as a percent of net sales (Dollars in Millions): 

Gross margin is calculated as net sales less cost of merchandise sold. Gross margin as a percent of net sales decreased 64 basis points in 2019 and increased 32 basis points in 2018. The decrease in 2019 was driven by higher shipping costs resulting from digital growth, an increase in promotional markdowns, and mix of business. The increase in 2018 was driven by effective inventory management that contributed to fewer permanent and promotional markdowns, partially offset by higher shipping costs resulting from digital growth.

Table of Contents 

Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses 

SG&A includes compensation and benefit costs (including stores, corporate headquarters, buying and merchandising, and distribution centers); occupancy and operating costs of our retail, distribution and corporate facilities; freight expenses associated with moving merchandise from our distribution centers to our retail stores and among distribution and retail facilities; marketing expenses, offset by vendor payments for reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs; expenses related to our credit card operations; and other administrative revenues and expenses. We do not include depreciation and amortization in SG&A. The classification of these expenses varies across the retail industry. 

Many of our expenses, including store payroll and distribution costs, are variable in nature. These costs generally increase as sales increase, and decrease as sales decrease. We measure both the change in these variable expenses and the expense as a percent of revenue. If the expense as a percent of revenue decreased from the prior year, the expense "leveraged". If the expense as a percent of revenue increased over the prior year, the expense "deleveraged". 

The following graph summarizes the increases and (decreases) in SG&A by expense type (Dollars in Millions) between 2018 and 2019: 

SG&A increased $104 million, or 1.9%, to $5.7 billion for 2019. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A deleveraged by 88 basis points. 

The increase in store expenses reflects higher rent expense, primarily due to the new lease accounting standard, costs related to brand launches, the Amazon Returns program, and wage pressure. Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were $350 million for 2019. This increased $38 million due to higher transportation and payroll costs at our E-Commerce fulfillment centers driven by growth in digital sales. Marketing costs reflect higher digital and broadcast spend. Technology costs increased as we continue to invest in our business. Expenses from our credit card operations decreased due to savings in payroll and operating costs. Corporate and other expenses decreased due to lower general corporate costs and incentives.  

22 

Table of Contents 

The following graph summarizes the increases and (decreases) in SG&A by expense type (Dollars in Millions) between 2017 and 2018: 

SG&A increased $100 million, or 1.8%, to $5.6 billion for 2018. The increase was net of approximately $40 million of incremental expense in 2017 due to the 53rd week in the fiscal 2017 calendar. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A deleveraged by 30 basis points. 

The increase in technology expenses reflects higher spend as we migrate technology systems to the cloud. Leadership changes drove the increase in corporate expenses. Distribution costs, which exclude payroll related to online originated orders that were shipped from our stores, were $312 million for 2018 and increased $9 million due to higher transportation costs. Marketing costs reflect higher digital and personalization spend. In our stores, increases in expenses driven by omnichannel support of ship-from-store and buy online, pick-up in store operations were offset by productivity improvements. Expenses from our credit card operations decreased due to savings in payroll and operating costs.   

Other Expenses 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The changes in depreciation and amortization reflect the net impact of lower depreciation due to the maturing of our stores and the impact of the new lease accounting standard in 2019, offset by higher amortization due to investments in technology, higher depreciation from our fifth E-Commerce fulfillment center which opened in 2017, and a $22 million write-off in 2017 of information technology projects that no longer fit into our strategic and cloud migration plans.

Table of Contents 

Impairments, store closing, and other costs in 2019 include $52 million of asset impairment charges related to the closure of four Kohl’s stores and four Off-Aisle clearance centers, $30 million in severance, which includes our corporate restructuring effort along with the execution of a voluntary role reduction program, $10 million related to brand exits, and a $21 million impairment related to technology projects that no longer align with our strategic plans. Impairments, store closing, and other costs in 2018 included the following expenses related to closing four stores, consolidating call center locations which supported both Kohl’s charge and online customers, a voluntary retirement program, and the impairment of certain assets: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense, net decreased in 2019 due primarily to the benefits of debt reductions in 2018 and adoption of the new lease accounting standard in the first quarter of 2019. The decrease in interest expense in 2018 was driven by the benefits of debt reductions in 2018. Higher interest income due to higher yields and investment balances and lower interest on finance leases as the portfolio matures also contributed to the decrease in 2018. 

Gain on extinguishment of debt of $9 million in 2019 resulted from the purchase of leased equipment that was accounted for as a financing obligation. Loss on the extinguishment of debt of $63 million in 2018 resulted from a $413 million make-whole call and a $500 million cash tender offer in 2018.  

Income Taxes 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our effective tax rates in 2019 and 2018 include the full year benefit of the decrease in the corporate rate. For 2017, the reduction in the tax rate was prorated, resulting in a statutory federal tax rate of 33.7%. In 2017, we recorded a total tax benefit of $136 million related to the federal tax rate reduction and the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as well as a $20 million benefit from the settlement of a significant state tax dispute. These items reduced our 2017 effective tax rate by 10.9 percentage points.

Adjusted Net Income and Earnings per Diluted Share 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We believe adjusted results are useful because they provide enhanced visibility into our results for the periods excluding the impact of certain items such as those included in the table above. However, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace GAAP measures. 

Inflation 

We expect that our operations will continue to be influenced by general economic conditions, including food, fuel and energy prices, higher wages, and by costs to source our merchandise, including tariffs. There can be no assurances that such factors will not impact our business in the future. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

The following table presents our primary uses and sources of cash: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our working capital and inventory levels typically build throughout the fall, peaking during the November and December holiday selling season.

The following table includes cash balances and changes: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Non-GAAP financial measure 

Operating Activities 

Operating activities generated cash of $1.7 billion in 2019 compared to cash of $2.1 billion in 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net income and changes in accrued and other operating liabilities. 

Net cash provided by Operating activities increased $416 million to $2.1 billion in 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to changes in accounts payable and other operating assets and liabilities. 

Investing Activities 

Net cash used in Investing activities increased $265 million to $837 million in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the investments in our sixth E-commerce fulfillment center, store strategies that include new stores and capital improvements to existing stores, and technology investments.  

Net cash used in Investing activities decreased $77 million to $572 million in 2018. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of technology spending. 

The following chart summarizes capital expenditures by major category: 

Financing Activities 

Financing activities used cash of $1.0 billion in 2019 compared to $1.9 billion in 2018. The reduction was primarily due to debt reductions in 2018 not repeated in 2019. 

We paid cash for treasury stock purchases of $470 million in 2019 and $396 million in 2018. Share repurchases are discretionary in nature. The timing and amount of repurchases are based upon available cash balances, our stock price and other factors. 

26 

Table of Contents 

We paid cash dividends of $423 million ($2.68 per share) in 2019, as detailed below, and $400 million ($2.44 per share) in 2018. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We used cash to repurchase $6 million of debt on the open market in 2019. We used cash to repurchase $530 million of debt pursuant to a tender offer on the open market and on a $413 million make-whole provision in 2018. We may again seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through open market cash purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. 

As of February 1, 2020, our credit ratings were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Free Cash Flow 

We generated $700 million of free cash flow for 2019 compared to $1.4 billion in 2018. The decrease is primarily the result of a reduction in net income, changes in operating assets and liabilities, and increased capital expenditures due to investments in our sixth E-commerce fulfillment center, store strategies that include new stores and capital improvements to existing stores, and technology investments. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from financing obligations (which generally represent landlord reimbursements of construction costs) less capital expenditures and finance lease and financing obligation payments. Free cash flow should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other financial measures such as net income and net cash provided by operating activities. We believe that free cash flow represents our ability to generate additional cash flow from our business operations. 

The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities (a GAAP measure) to free cash flow (a non-GAAP measure): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Key Financial Ratios 

Key financial ratios that provide certain measures of our liquidity are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The decreases in our working capital and current ratio are primarily due to lower cash balances as a result of capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividends.

Return on Investment Ratios 

The following table provides additional measures of our return on investments: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)Non-GAAP financial measures 

Changes in earnings and the adoption of the new lease accounting standard drove changes in our return on investment ratios. The lease accounting standard impacted the ROI positively by approximately 60 bps. 

We believe that ROI is a useful financial measure in evaluating our operating performance. When analyzed in conjunction with our net earnings and total assets, it provides investors with a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and our management of assets from period to period. ROI is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and rent (“EBITDAR”) divided by average gross investment. EBITDAR is a useful non-GAAP measure that excludes items that are non-operating in nature and focuses on items that are key to our operating performance. Our ROI calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. ROI should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other GAAP financial measures. Return on investment ratios that are adjusted for certain items are useful financial measures because they illustrate the impact of these items on each metric. See the key financial ratio calculations below for our ROI and Adjusted ROI calculations. 

Capital Structure Ratio 

The following table provides an additional measure of our capital structure: 

 2019  

2018  

Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR (a)  

2.51  

2.16  

(a)Non-GAAP financial measure 

The increase in our Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR ratio is primarily due to lower operating income. 

Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR is a non-GAAP financial measure which we define as our adjusted outstanding debt balance divided by adjusted EBITDAR. We believe that our debt levels are best analyzed using this measure. Our current goals are to maintain a ratio that demonstrates our commitment to an investment grade rating and allows us to operate with an efficient capital structure for our size, growth plans and industry. Our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR calculation may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR should be evaluated in addition to, and not considered a substitute for, other GAAP financial measures. See the key financial ratio calculations section below for our adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDAR calculation. 

Our debt agreements contain various covenants including limitations on additional indebtedness and a maximum permitted debt ratio. As of February 1, 2020, we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance during 2020. See the key financial ratio calculations section below for our debt covenant calculation.

Contractual Obligations 

Our contractual obligations as of February 1, 2020 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Our leases typically require that we pay taxes, insurance and maintenance costs in addition to the minimum rental payments included in the table above. Such costs vary from period to period and totaled $189 million for 2019, $183 million for 2018, and $184 million for 2017. The lease term includes cancelable option periods which are reasonably certain to be exercised. 

(b)  

Other includes royalties, legally binding minimum lease and interest payments for stores opening in 2020 or later, as well as payments associated with technology, marketing, and donation agreements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have not provided any financial guarantees as of year-end 2019. 

We have not created, and are not party to, any special-purpose or off-balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital, incurring debt or operating our business. We do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our financial condition, liquidity, results of operations or capital resources.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors.  

Retail Inventory Method and Inventory Valuation 

Merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (“RIM”). Under RIM, the valuation of inventory at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the retail value of inventory. RIM is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. The use of RIM will result in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market since permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. We would record an additional reserve if the future estimated selling price is less than cost. 

31 

Table of Contents 

RIM inherently requires management judgment and estimates, such as the amount and timing of permanent markdowns to clear unproductive or slow-moving inventory, which may impact the ending inventory valuation as well as gross margin. Factors considered in the determination of permanent markdowns include current and anticipated demand, customer preferences, age of the merchandise, fashion trends and weather conditions. 

Inventory shrinkage is estimated as a percent of sales for the period between the last physical inventory count and the balance sheet date. Shrink is the difference between the recorded amount of inventory and the physical inventory. We perform an annual physical inventory count at the majority of our stores, E-Commerce fulfillment centers, and distribution centers. The shrinkage rate from the most recent physical inventory, in combination with current events and historical experience, is used as the standard for the shrinkage accrual rate for the next inventory cycle. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. 

Vendor Allowances 

We frequently receive allowances from our vendors for markdowns that we have taken in order to sell the vendor’s merchandise and/or to support gross margins earned on those sales. This markdown support generally relates to sold inventory or permanent markdowns and, accordingly, is reflected as a reduction to cost of merchandise sold. Markdown support related to merchandise that has not yet been sold is recorded in inventory. 

We also receive support from vendors for marketing and other costs that we have incurred to sell the vendors’ merchandise. To the extent the reimbursements are for specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor's products and do not exceed the costs incurred, they are recognized as a reduction of selling, general, and administrative expenses. If these criteria are not met, the support is recorded in inventory and reflected as a reduction of costs of merchandise sold when the related merchandise is sold. 

Insurance Reserve Estimates 

We are primarily self-insured for costs related to workers’ compensation, general liability, and employee-related health care benefits. We use a third-party actuary to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. The actuary considers historical claims experience, demographic and severity factors, health care trends, and actuarial assumptions to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks. Historically, our actuarial estimates have not been materially different from actual results. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

We review our long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances, such as decisions to close a store or significant operating losses, indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. All long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually. 

If our evaluations, which are performed on an undiscounted cash flow basis, indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, the potential impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the impaired asset. 

Identifying impaired assets and quantifying the related impairment loss, if any, requires significant estimates by management. The most significant of these estimates is the cash flow expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual store, management estimates future store performance including sales, gross margin, and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and occupancy expense. Projected cash flows must be estimated for future periods throughout the remaining life of the property, which may be as many as 40 years in the future. The accuracy of these estimates will be impacted by a number of factors including general economic conditions, changes in competitive landscape and our ability to effectively manage the operations of the store. We recorded impairments of $73 million in 2019 and $72 million in 2018 in Impairments, store closing and other costs.

Income Taxes 

We regularly evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit for income tax positions we have taken in various federal and state filings by considering all relevant facts, circumstances and information available to us. If we believe it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained, we recognize a benefit at the largest amount which we believe is cumulatively greater than 50% likely to be realized. 

Unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Also, as audits are completed or statutes of limitations lapse, it may be necessary to record adjustments to our taxes payable, deferred tax assets, tax reserves or income tax expense. Although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different. Income taxes are further described in Note 5 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Leases 

Accounting for leased properties requires compliance with technical accounting rules and significant judgment by management. Application of these accounting rules and assumptions made by management will determine if we are considered the owner for accounting purposes or whether the lease is accounted for as a finance or operating lease. 

The following are significant estimates used by management in accounting for real estate and other leases: 

•  

Accounting lease term—Our accounting lease term includes all noncancelable periods and renewal periods that are reasonably assured of being exercised. Typically, renewal options are considered reasonably assured of being exercised if we have made significant leasehold improvements that would exceed the initial or renewal lease term and the cash flow performance of the store remains strong. The expected lease term is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease.  

•  

Incremental borrowing rate—The incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that the lessee would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The incremental borrowing rate is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease.  

•  

Fair market value of leased asset—The fair market value of leased retail property is generally estimated based on comparable market data as provided by third-party appraisers or consideration received from the landlord. Fair market value is used in determining whether the lease is accounted for as an operating lease or a finance lease. 

Leases are further described in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
