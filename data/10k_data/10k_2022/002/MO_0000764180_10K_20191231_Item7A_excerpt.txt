Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Interest Rates

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of Altria’s long-term debt, all of which is fixed-rate debt, was $30.7 billion and $12.5 billion, respectively. The fair value of Altria’s long-term debt is subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in market interest rates. A 1% increase in market interest rates at December 31, 2019 and 2018 would decrease the fair value of Altria’s long-term debt by approximately $2.4 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. A 1% decrease in market interest rates at December 31, 2019 and 2018 would increase the fair value of Altria’s long-term debt by approximately $2.7 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively.

Interest rates on borrowings under the Credit Agreement are expected to be based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or a mutually agreed upon benchmark rate, plus a percentage based on the higher of the ratings of Altria’s long-term senior unsecured debt from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s. The applicable percentage based on Altria’s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings at December 31, 2019 for borrowings under the Credit Agreement was 1.0%. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Altria had no borrowings under the Credit Agreement.

Equity Price Risk

The estimated fair values of the Fixed-price Preemptive Rights and the Cronos warrant are subject to equity price risk. The Fixed-price Preemptive Rights and warrant are recorded at fair value, which is estimated using Black-Scholes option-pricing models. The fair values of the Fixed-price Preemptive Rights and Cronos warrant are subject to fluctuations resulting from changes in the quoted market price of Cronos shares, the underlying equity security.

At December 31, 2019, the fair values of the Fixed-price Preemptive Rights and Cronos warrant were $69 million and $234 million, respectively. A 10% increase or decrease in the quoted market price of Cronos shares at December 31, 2019 would increase or decrease the fair values of the Fixed-price Preemptive Rights and Cronos warrant by approximately $13 million and $37 million, respectively.
