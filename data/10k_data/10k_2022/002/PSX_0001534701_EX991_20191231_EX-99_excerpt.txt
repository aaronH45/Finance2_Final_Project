2019 Consolidated Financial Statements

With Report of Independent Auditors

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (the Company), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, changes in members’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements 

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; this includes the design, implementation and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are free of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor’s Responsibility

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.

An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. 

Opinion

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC at December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases

As discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases” effective January 1, 2019. Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

Note 1 - General Information

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC1, through its subsidiaries and equity affiliates, manufactures and markets a wide range of petrochemicals on a worldwide basis, with manufacturing facilities in Belgium, Colombia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and the United States. CPChem is a limited liability company formed under Delaware law, owned 50 percent by Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (Chevron), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, and 50 percent by Phillips 66 Company (P66Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of Phillips 66 (collectively, the members).

The Company is governed by its Board of Directors (the Board) under the terms of a limited liability company agreement. There are three voting representatives appointed by each of Chevron and P66Co, and the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the

1 Unless otherwise indicated, “the Company”, “CPChem”, “we”, “our”, and “us” are used in this report to refer to the business of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Company are non-voting representatives. Certain major decisions and actions require the approval of the Board. All decisions and actions of the Board require the approval of at least one representative from each of Chevron and of P66Co.

CPChem manufactures and markets ethylene, propylene and associated olefin co-products that are primarily consumed internally for the production of polyethylene (PE), normal alpha olefins (NAO) and PE pipe. CPChem has six olefins and polyolefins production facilities located in Texas, six domestic pipe production facilities, one domestic pipe fittings production facility, and a polyalphaolefins (PAO) facility in Belgium. In addition, the Company owns interests in: a PE plant located at its Cedar Bayou facility in Texas; ethylene, PE and NAO (1-hexene and full range) operations in Qatar; an ethylene, propylene, PE, polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS) and 1-hexene facility in Saudi Arabia; and a PE facility in Singapore.

The Company also manufactures and markets a variety of specialty products, including organosulfur chemicals, and aromatics products such as benzene and cyclohexane. Production facilities are located in Mississippi, Texas and Belgium. In addition, CPChem owns interests in aromatics and styrene facilities in Saudi Arabia and in multiple styrenics facilities in North and South America.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation and Investments – The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. All significant intercompany investments, accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Investments in affiliates in which CPChem has 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting control, or in which the Company exercises significant influence but not control over major decisions, are accounted for using the equity method. Other securities and investments are accounted for under the cost method.

Estimates, Risks and Uncertainties – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions.

There are varying degrees of risk and uncertainty in each of the countries in which CPChem operates. The Company insures the business and its assets against material insurable risks in a manner deemed appropriate. Because of the diversity of CPChem’s operations, the Company believes any loss incurred from an uninsured event in any one business or country, other than damages from named windstorms or a terrorist act directed at CPChem operations, would not have a material adverse effect on operations as a whole. However, any such loss could have a material impact on financial results in the period recorded.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Revenue Recognition – Sales of petrochemicals, natural gas liquids and other items, including by-products, are recorded as revenue when control of the product is transferred to the customer. Sales are presented net of discounts and allowances. Licensing fees for licensed technology paid in advance are recognized as revenue as the associated services are rendered, while royalties paid based on a licensee’s production are recognized as volumes are produced by the licensee. Commission income is recognized as revenue when control of products is transferred to the customer. See Note 4 for more information.

Cash and Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and have original maturities of three months or less from their date of purchase.

Accounts Receivable – Accounts receivable is shown net of an allowance for estimated non-recoverable amounts. Accounts that are deemed uncollectible are written off to expense.

Inventories – For U.S. operations, cost of product inventories is primarily determined using the dollar-value, last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. These inventories are valued at the lower-of-cost-or-market (LCM). For operations outside the U.S., product inventories are typically valued using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or the weighted-average method. Materials and supplies inventories are carried at weighted-average cost. Inventories valued using either the FIFO or the weighted-average methods are measured at the lower-of-cost-or-net realizable value. See Note 9 for more information.

Property, Plant and Equipment – Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, and is comprised of assets, defined as property units, with an initial expected economic life beyond one year. Asset categories are used to compute depreciation and amortization using the straight-line method over the associated estimated useful lives.

Long-lived assets used in operations are assessed for possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential significant deterioration in future cash flows projected to be generated by an asset group. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets, which is generally at a product line level.

If, upon review, the sum of the projected undiscounted pre-tax cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. The fair values of impaired assets are usually determined based on the present value of projected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the asset group, as quoted market prices in active markets are generally not available. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on projected production quantities, sales quantities, prices and costs, considering available internal and external information at the date of review.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Should an impairment of assets arise, the Company may be required to record a charge to operations that could be material to the period reported. However, CPChem believes that any such charge, if required, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

Leases – Leases with a term greater than 12 months, for which the Company is the lessee, are recognized as either operating or finance right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Leases in which the Company is the lessor are all either sales-type or operating leases with the associated revenues recognized in Other income of the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. See Notes 3 and 12 for more information.

Equity Method Investments – Investments in affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in which CPChem has 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting control, or in which the Company exercises significant influence but not control over major decisions, are accounted for using the equity method. Included in the investment value is interest that is capitalized in Investments in and advances to affiliates for qualifying assets that are constructed or acquired while the affiliate is engaged in activities necessary to begin its planned principal operations. This, along with other factors, such as the initial investment in an affiliate, can create a difference between CPChem’s carrying value of an equity investment and the Company’s underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate, known as a basis difference. Such differences are generally amortized as a change in the carrying value of the investment, with an offset recorded to Equity in income of affiliates, over the useful life of the affiliate’s primary asset.

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred that is other than a temporary decline in value. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the Company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s estimated fair value. In such cases, the investment is impaired down to fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks of the investment.

Maintenance and Repairs – Maintenance and repair costs, including turnaround costs of major producing units, are expensed as incurred.

Research and Development Costs – Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Property Dispositions – Assets that are no longer in service and for which there is no contemplated future use by the Company are retired. When assets are retired or sold, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated, with any gain or loss reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.

10

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Asset Retirement Obligations – An asset and a liability are recorded at fair value when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount and timing can be reasonably estimated. When the liability is initially recorded, the cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. Over time, the liability is increased for changes in present value, and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the related asset.

Foreign Currency Translation – Adjustments that result from translating foreign financial statements using a foreign functional currency into U.S. dollars are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Members’ Equity. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings. Many of CPChem’s foreign operations use their local currency as the functional currency.

Environmental Costs – Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized as appropriate, depending on future economic benefit. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations and that do not have future economic benefit are expensed. Liabilities for expenditures are recorded on an undiscounted basis unless the amount and timing of cash payments for the liability are fixed or determinable, in which case they are recorded on a discounted basis. Expenditures that create future benefits or that contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized and depreciated or amortized, as applicable, over their estimated useful lives.

Capitalization of Interest – Interest costs incurred to finance major projects with an expected construction period of longer than one year, and interest costs associated with investments in equity affiliates that have their planned principal operations under construction, are capitalized until commercial production begins. Capitalized interest is amortized over the life of the associated asset.

Income Taxes – CPChem is treated as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax and for most state income tax purposes whereby each member is taxable on its respective share of income, and tax-benefited on its respective share of loss. However, CPChem is liable for certain state income and franchise taxes, and for foreign income and withholding taxes incurred directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.

Certain amounts for prior periods have been reclassified in order to conform to the current reporting presentation.

Note 3 - New Accounting Standards

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires lessees to recognize a ROU asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Under the new standard, operating leases result in straight-line expense recognition (similar to prior operating leases) while finance leases result in a front-loaded expense recognition pattern 

11

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

(similar to prior capital leases). The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2019, using an optional modified retrospective transition method, which had no impact to the Company's opening balance of Members' Equity at adoption date with no adjustment to previously recorded results. The Company also applied certain optional practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed the carryforward of historical lease classification as well as additional practical expedients related to land easements, short-term leases, and non-lease components. The Company did not elect the practical expedient related to hindsight.

The standard had a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet, but did not materially impact its Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of ROU lease assets and Lease liabilities of $312 million on January 1, 2019. At the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases, ROU assets included lease payments already made. See Note 12 for more information.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with a forward-looking expected credit loss model which will result in earlier recognition of credit losses. This guidance will be effective for CPChem on January 1, 2023, and early adoption is permitted. CPChem is evaluating the requirements of the new standard, as well as the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 - Sales and Other Operating Revenues

The following table disaggregates revenue by major source:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues from product sales

CPChem sells petrochemical products to customers around the world. CPChem typically transfers control of the product and recognizes a sale when we ship the product from our manufacturing facility to our customer or when the product reaches a contractually specified location. Products are shipped by a variety of transportation means including railcar, truck, pipeline, and ocean vessel. Customers generally have the right to inspect the product upon delivery, and if the product fails to meet agreed-upon quality specifications, they can request to return the product for replacement. 

12

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Sales are recorded net of discounts and allowances, if any, and sales-based taxes collected from customers. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling as fulfillment activities to transfer the control of promised goods or services.

Most of CPChem’s sales contracts have a single performance obligation, which is the sale of petrochemical products. Additional promised goods or services in these contracts, if any, are generally immaterial in the context of the contract. In such circumstances, the Company does not separately account for or allocate revenue to such promised goods or services when the contracts effectively contain only one single performance obligation. For contracts that contain multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation in proportion to its estimated standalone selling price.

Pricing is often structured around market-based price indices. To the extent customers receive cash-based incentives or pricing discounts based on purchased volumes, they are accounted for as variable consideration at the most likely amount we expect to provide to customers. Payment terms vary according to normal industry practice. When it is anticipated that a customer’s credit might pose higher risks as to the timing and certainty of payment, the Company requires prepayments or payment security in the form of letters of credit or guarantees to mitigate such credit risks. CPChem does not typically engage in customer financing arrangements.

Other operating revenues

Other operating revenues mainly include activities ancillary to the Company’s core business, such as tolling arrangements, catalyst sales, product storage, transportation services, and distribution agreements. The Company also markets and sells petrochemical products on behalf of certain joint venture affiliates for which it receives commission income. See Notes 8 and 10 for more information. These ancillary activities are recognized as revenue when control of such goods or services are transferred to customers, typically upon satisfaction of the performance obligation depending on the terms of the underlying contract. In addition, CPChem earns licensing fees and sales-based production royalties from licensing certain proprietary technologies and production processes in select markets. Revenue is recognized as the associated services are rendered, while royalties based on a licensee’s production are recognized as volumes are produced by the licensee.

Note 5 - Hurricane Harvey

On August 25, 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall, and the subsequent tropical storm caused significant flooding to the Texas region of the U.S. Gulf Coast (USGC). CPChem operates facilities along the Texas region of the USGC at Sweeny, Old Ocean, Port Arthur, Orange, Pasadena and Cedar Bayou. All CPChem facilities in the area were shut down as the storm passed through the region. Facilities at Sweeny, Old Ocean, Port Arthur, Orange and Pasadena did not experience significant property damage and resumed operations beginning early to mid-September 2017. The Cedar Bayou facility, however, sustained severe damage due to the flooding. The facility resumed most of its operations in the fourth quarter of 2017 and was fully 

13

operational by the end of the first quarter of 2018. The Company recognized $42 million and $348 million in asset write-offs and repair and remediation expenses, which were included in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No additional costs were incurred in 2019.

Note 6 - Sale of K-Resin® SBC Business

In February 2017, the Company completed the sale of its K-Resin® styrene-butadiene copolymers (SBC) business, inclusive of CPChem’s investment in K R Copolymer Co., Ltd., to INEOS Styrolution. The sale resulted in a $32 million net gain that was included in Other income in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and net proceeds received of $82 million were included in Proceeds from sale of assets in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Note 7 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

The change in Accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the impact of significant amounts reclassified from AOCL in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, are reflected in the table below.

Note 12 - Leases

CPChem determines whether an arrangement, at its inception, is or contains a lease. Leases are included in Right-of-use (ROU) lease assets, Other current liabilities and deferred credits, and Lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. ROU assets represent the right to use an identified asset for the term, and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of the Company's leases do not provide an implicit rate, credit-adjusted tenor-specific yield curves from an independent third party are used as an incremental borrowing rate applied to the present value calculation at the lease commencement date. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable.

CPChem excludes most variable lease payments in measuring ROU assets and lease liabilities other than those that depend on an index, a rate, or are in substance fixed payments. Certain lease agreements include variable lease payments based on LIBOR; other lease payments are adjusted periodically for inflation based on Consumer Price Index, Producer Price Index, or other escalators. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees probable of being paid or material restrictive covenants. For leases that commingle the lease and non-lease components, where the non-lease component is determined to be insignificant when compared to the lease component, the Company has elected the practical expedient to have the lease and non-lease components treated as a single lease component for all asset classes.

CPChem primarily has operating leases for railcars, office buildings, tanks, storage caverns, and other facilities and equipment, some of which are leased from Phillips 66. The Company has elected the short-term lease exception, which allows leases with an initial term of 12 months or less to be excluded from the Consolidated Balance Sheet unless the Company is reasonably certain to extend the lease term beyond 12 months. Leases have remaining terms ranging from less than 1 year to 56 years.

Some leases include options to renew the terms that can extend from 5 to 10 years with the exercise of lease renewal options solely at the discretion of CPChem as a lessee. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. Some leases include an option to terminate the contract with notice.

Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental liabilities at December 31 were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental liabilities that are classified as short-term are included in Other current liabilities and deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Long-term asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental liabilities are included in Other liabilities and deferred credits on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Asset Retirement Obligations

Asset retirement obligations are primarily related to asbestos abatement at certain of the Company's facilities.

Accrued Environmental Liabilities

Accrued environmental liabilities are primarily related to soil and groundwater remedial investigations at domestic facilities and site restoration activities at the Puerto Rico facility.

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

There were no material differences between accrued discounted environmental liabilities and the associated undiscounted amounts.

Note 14 - Debt

The components of debt at December 31 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In February 2018, CPChem issued, in a private placement, $500 million of 3.3% senior unsecured notes due in May 2023 with interest payable semiannually and $550 million of 3.7% senior unsecured notes due in June 2028 with interest payable semiannually. 

In November 2016, CPChem issued, in a private placement, $700 million of 3.4% senior unsecured notes due in December 2026 with interest payable semiannually.

In May 2015, CPChem issued, in a private placement, $250 million of floating rate senior unsecured notes due in May 2020, and $400 million of 2.45% senior unsecured notes due in May 2020. Interest is payable semiannually on the fixed rate notes and quarterly on the floating rate notes. The interest rate on the floating rate notes is equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.75%, which was 2.66% and 3.29% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

All of the outstanding unsecured senior notes contain covenants limiting liens, sale/leaseback transactions, sale of all or substantially all assets, and certain business combinations, but they contain no financial statement covenants. CPChem does not consider these covenants to be restrictive to normal operations.

CPChem’s commercial paper program is supported by available capacity under the Company’s two revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facilities consist of a $400 million facility scheduled to expire in February 2021 and a $400 million facility scheduled to expire in February 2023. CPChem can increase the capacity under each facility with lender approval, by up to $200 million, to a total aggregate capacity under both facilities of $1.2 billion. The credit agreements contain covenants and events of default typical of bank revolving credit facilities, such as restrictions on liens, but they contain no financial statement covenants. The agreements also 

25

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

contain a provision requiring maintenance of CPChem’s ownership by Chevron and/or P66Co of at least 50 percent in the aggregate. CPChem does not consider these provisions to be restrictive to normal operations. There was no balance outstanding on either program at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

The $650 million of debt maturing in 2020 was classified as long-term debt based on the Company's ability and intent to refinance the obligation on a long-term basis, with such ability supported by the two existing revolving credit facilities, which provide a combined total borrowing capacity of $800 million and are scheduled to expire in February 2021 and 2023, respectively.

CPChem is also a party to a trade receivables securitization agreement that was suspended at CPChem’s request in March 2018. The terms of the suspended agreement allow the facility to be re-instated with approval from the lenders at any point prior to March 29, 2021.

Note 15 - Guarantees and Indemnifications

Guarantees

CPChem’s headquarters building is leased under an agreement that was renewed effective September 2015 for an additional five years and may be extended further at market rates upon mutual agreement with the landlord. The agreement contains a fixed price purchase option, which was considered to be the fair market value of the building at the time of the lease renewal, and a residual value guarantee. If CPChem does not extend the lease or exercise the purchase option prior to the expiration of the lease, the Company has an obligation to pay the lessor the shortfall, if any, in the proceeds realized from the sale of the building to a third party relative to the guaranteed residual value of $35 million. Under the lease, CPChem is entitled to receive any proceeds from the sale of the building that are in excess of the purchase option price. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount, if any, that the Company would be required to pay or be entitled to receive should the building be sold to a third party upon the expiration of the lease, CPChem believes that the amount paid or received would not be material to consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

CPChem is a party to a railcar lease agreement covering a total of 1,950 railcars. Of these railcars, 1,550 are under a five-year term through May 2022 and the remaining 400 railcars are under a five-year term through March 2023. During the lease term, CPChem has the right to purchase all of the railcars at any time, with a minimum 60-day notice period, for the then-outstanding lease balance. If CPChem does not exercise the purchase option prior to the expiration of the lease, the Company has an obligation to pay the lessor the shortfall, if any, in the proceeds realized from the sale of the railcars to a third party relative to the guaranteed residual values of $112 million for the 1,550 railcars and of $27 million for the 400 railcars.

See Note 10 for a discussion of certain guarantees and commitments related to the Company’s investments in affiliates. While it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount, if any, that the Company would be required to pay or be entitled to receive should the railcars be sold to a 

26

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

third party upon the expiration of the lease, CPChem believes that the amount paid or received would not be material to consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Indemnifications

As part of CPChem’s ongoing business operations, the Company enters into numerous agreements with other parties which apportion future risks between the parties to the transaction or relationship governed by the agreements. One method of apportioning risk is the inclusion of provisions requiring one party to indemnify the other party against losses that might be incurred in the future. Many of CPChem’s agreements, including technology license agreements, contain indemnities that require the Company to perform certain acts, such as defending certain licensees against patent infringement claims of others, as a result of the occurrence of a triggering event or condition.

These indemnity obligations are diverse and numerous, and each has different terms, business purposes, and triggering events or conditions. In addition, the indemnities in each agreement vary widely in their definitions of both the triggering event and the resulting obligation, which is contingent upon that triggering event. Because many of CPChem’s indemnity obligations are not limited in duration or potential monetary exposure, the Company cannot reasonably calculate the maximum potential amount of future payments that could possibly be paid under the indemnity obligations stemming from all of its existing agreements. CPChem is not aware of the occurrence of any triggering event or condition that would have a material adverse impact on consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of an indemnity obligation arising from such a triggering event or condition.

Note 16 - Contingent Liabilities

In the case of known contingent liabilities, CPChem records an undiscounted liability when a loss is probable, and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These liabilities are not reduced for potential insurance recoveries. If applicable, undiscounted receivables are recorded for probable loss recoveries from insurance or other parties. As facts concerning contingent liabilities become known, the Company reassesses its position with respect to accrued liabilities and other potential exposures. Estimates that are particularly sensitive to future change include legal and regulatory matters and environmental remediation. Estimated future costs related to legal and regulatory matters and environmental remediation are subject to change as events occur and as additional information becomes available.

CPChem believes it is remote that future costs related to known contingent liabilities will exceed current accruals by an amount that would have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

27

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Legal Matters

CPChem is responsible for certain lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos, most of which are alleged to have taken place prior to the time CPChem was formed. These lawsuits are frequently dismissed or resolved through negotiated settlement prior to trial, but trials do sometimes occur and have resulted in judgments both in favor of and against CPChem’s interests.

CPChem has recorded a liability for its estimated obligation for certain asbestos-related claims. The liability as recorded is not considered to be material to the financial position or liquidity of the Company. In the event that CPChem’s actual obligation exceeds its current accrual, the Company will be required to record a charge to operations that could be considered material to the period during which the charge is reported. However, CPChem believes that any such charge, if required, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or liquidity.

CPChem is a party to a number of other legal proceedings and regulatory matters that arose in the ordinary course of business for which, in many instances, no provision has been made in the financial statements.

Environmental Obligations

CPChem is subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that may result in obligations to mitigate or remove the effects on the environment of the placement, storage, disposal or release of certain chemical, mineral and petroleum substances at its sites. Estimated future environmental remediation costs are subject to change due to such factors as the periodic refinement of remediation estimates for cleanup costs, prospective changes in laws and regulations, the unknown timing and extent of ultimate remedial actions that may be required, and the determination of CPChem’s liability in proportion to those of other responsible parties. The Company records accruals for environmental liabilities based on best estimates obtained from consulting and engineering subject matter experts. Un-asserted claims are considered in the determination of environmental liabilities and are accrued in the period when they become probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 13 for a discussion of environmental liabilities accrued by the Company.

The Company also assumed certain historical environmental liabilities at formation. In some cases, CPChem may be entitled to indemnification for all or a portion of the accrued environmental liabilities. Environmental investigations are currently being conducted at certain Company facilities, and the Company has an ongoing groundwater remediation project at its Puerto Rico facility, which could extend up to 15 years. Following completion of the environmental investigations, the potential for any additional remediation liabilities and applicable indemnifications will be determined.

28

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

Note 17 - Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject CPChem to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Cash equivalents are currently comprised of bank accounts and short-term investments with several financial institutions that have investment grade credit ratings. The Company’s policy for short-term investments both diversifies and limits its exposure to credit risk. Trade receivables are dispersed among a broad customer base, both domestic and international, which generally results in limited concentrations of credit risk. Although CPChem maintains and follows credit policies and procedures designed to monitor and control counterparty receivable credit risk and exposure, a deterioration of general economic conditions and/or the financial condition of specific customers could result in an increase in CPChem’s credit risk or limit CPChem’s ability to collect accounts receivable from impacted customers. As part of its credit policy, the Company may require security from counterparties in the form of letters of credit or guarantees in amounts sufficient to support the credit exposure.

Note 18 - Fair Value Measurements

Accounting standards require disclosures that categorize assets and liabilities measured or disclosed at fair value into one of three different levels, depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market-corroborated inputs. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability reflecting significant modifications to observable related market data or the Company’s assumptions about pricing by market participants.

The carrying amounts of cash equivalents, trade and affiliated receivables, trade and affiliated payables, and short-term debt approximate fair values. The principal carrying amount of debt outstanding was $2.400 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018, with fair value of $2.483 billion and $2.369 billion, in each case at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The long-term debt fair value was based on market-corroborated inputs consistent with Level 2 classification criteria in the fair value hierarchy.

Recurring Measurements

Deferred Compensation Plan Liabilities - CPChem records certain nonqualified deferred compensation plan liabilities at fair value, most of which were recorded as Employee benefit obligations on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company values its deferred compensation liabilities, based on notional investments, using closing prices of underlying assets (mutual funds, common stocks and common collective trusts) provided by the exchange or issuer as of the balance sheet date, and these are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Common collective trusts, classified as Level 2, are valued based on the current values of the underlying assets of the trusts as determined by the issuer.

29

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

The following table summarizes these deferred compensation financial liabilities at December 31, valued on a recurring basis at fair value:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commodity Derivative Contracts - CPChem occasionally uses commodity derivative contracts to manage exposures to fluctuations in commodity prices. We generally elect the normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) exception to commodity contracts when it is expected that these volumes will be used in the normal course of business and follows the accrual method of accounting. When the Company cannot apply the NPNS exception, these purchase contracts are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value as derivative instruments. 

The Company values these derivatives based upon market-corroborated inputs consistent with Level 2 classification criteria in the fair value hierarchy. Assets associated with derivatives that do not qualify for the NPNS exception are recorded in either Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other assets and deferred charges depending on the expected settlement period. Liabilities associated with derivatives that do not qualify for the NPNS exception are recorded in either Other current liabilities and deferred credits or Other liabilities and deferred credits depending on the expected settlement period. All realized and unrealized gains and losses from the purchase and sale of derivative contracts that do not qualify for the NPNS exception are recognized in Cost of goods sold and Sales and other operating revenues, respectively, in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. There were no derivative assets or liabilities outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

In association with the commodity derivative contracts, for the contracts that did not qualify for the NPNS exception, the gains (losses) incurred, and the line items where they appear in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Nonrecurring Measurements

As a result of changes in plans regarding operations, impairment analyses were performed for certain asset groups in 2017. Because the carrying values of the individual asset groups were not recoverable, the asset groups were written down to fair value less cost to sell, as applicable.

30

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

In the fourth quarter of 2017, an impairment analysis was completed for an asset group resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss of $62 million, which was included in Cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in Asset impairments in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017. The fair value was $51 million at the measurement date of December 31, 2017.

An asset impairment analysis was performed for another asset group in 2017. The recognized impairment loss of $65 million was included in Equity in income of affiliates in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income and in Asset impairments in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2017. The fair value was zero at March 31, 2017, the date the measurement was taken.

Fair values are measured based on (i) the present values of the Company’s estimated expected future cash flows using discount rates CPChem believes are commensurate with the risk involved in the asset groups, or (ii) actual offer prices, as applicable, and are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

A measurement date of December 31 is used in the determination of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and plan assets. The funded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The actuarial loss in the pension benefits obligation was driven by the decrease in the discount rate combined with a change in the census data used to measure the obligation. The actuarial loss in the other benefits obligation was driven by a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the obligation.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The expected returns on plan assets were developed through, among other things, analysis of historical market returns for the plans’ investment classes and current market conditions.

The Company’s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of domestic and international equities, fixed income securities, real estate and cash equivalents. Target asset allocations are chosen by the investment committees for each plan based on analyses of the historical returns and volatilities of various asset classes in comparison with plan-specific projected funding and benefit disbursement requirements. The target asset allocation for all of CPChem’s pension plans, in aggregate, was 55 percent equities, 36 percent fixed income, and 9 percent real estate at December 31, 2019. The Company’s investment committee uses a dynamic de-risking/re-risking program for the Company’s main pension plan. Under this program, the plan’s allocation to fixed income will increase as its funded status improves and decrease if its funded status deteriorates. Rates of return for the investment funds comprising each asset class are monitored quarterly against benchmarks and peer fund results. The diversified portfolios for each pension plan are intended to prevent significant concentrations of risk within plan assets, although plan assets are subject to general market and security-specific risks. The Company expects to fund approximately $95 million to its pension and other postretirement benefits plans in 2020.

Following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:

•Mutual funds are valued using quoted market prices that represent the net asset values of shares held by the plans at year-end.

•Common collective trusts (CCTs) are valued at fair value using the net asset value as determined by the issuer based on the current values of the underlying assets of such trust.

•Guaranteed investment contracts (GIC) are valued using a discounted cash flow method. The projected cash flow stream related to the holdings at December 31, 2019 through a date corresponding to the projected average estimated duration of the participants’ investments in the contracts is discounted using the equivalent Treasury bond yield adjusted for the credit quality of the GIC issuer.

Other Postretirement Plan Assets

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)This asset class invests the majority of assets in securities of companies in the U.S. stock market (those similar to companies in the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 Index). 

(b)This asset class invests the majority of assets in securities of both companies in the U.S. stock market and companies based outside the U.S. boundaries (those similar to companies in the MSCI All Country World Index). 

(c)This asset class invests the majority of assets in securities of companies based outside the U.S. (those similar to companies in the MSCI All Country World ex-U.S. Index). 

2 Mutual funds are classified as Level 1 inputs and CCTs and Separate Accounts (SAs) are classified as Level 2 inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy in ASC 820 (refer to Note 18 for more information).

36

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

(d)This asset class invests the majority of assets in real estate assets based inside United States boundaries (those similar to real estate assets in the NCREIF Open End Diversified Core Equity (ODCE) Fund Index). 

(e)This asset class invests in debt investments of all types, with average portfolio durations approximating those of the benchmarks listed below, and allocates across investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging-market debt securities (those similar to investments in the Barclays Capital Long-Term Government/Credit Index, the Barclays Capital U.S. Long Credit Index, and the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index). 

(f)This asset class primarily invests in U.S. government securities with maturities of one year or less. 

(g)A GIC is an agreement between the issuer and the plan, in which the issuer agrees to pay a predetermined interest rate and principal for a set amount deposited with the issuer. 

It is anticipated that benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, will be paid as follows:

Defined Contribution Plans

Defined contribution plans are available for most employees, whereby CPChem matches a percentage of the employee’s contribution. The cost of the plans totaled $39 million in 2019, $37 million in 2018 and $36 million in 2017.

Note 20 - Income Taxes and Distributions

CPChem is treated as a flow-through entity for U.S. federal income tax and for most state income tax purposes whereby each member is taxed on its respective share of income, and tax-benefited on its respective share of loss. However, CPChem is liable for certain state income and franchise taxes, and for foreign income and withholding taxes incurred directly or indirectly by the Company. The Company follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes.

CPChem’s deferred income taxes reflect only the tax effect to the Company of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes. Major components of deferred income tax liabilities at December 31 follow:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Because CPChem is a flow-through entity as described above, the Company does not report in its financial statements the deferred income tax effect that flows through to the members. At December 31, 2019, the difference between the carrying amounts of the Company’s assets and liabilities reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the amounts used for federal income tax reporting purposes was $8.073 billion.

38

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

The components of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, with reconciliation between tax at the federal statutory rate and actual income tax expense, follow:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

CPChem’s reported effective tax rate does not correlate to the statutory federal income tax rate because of its status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Further, the Company is not subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states or foreign taxing authorities. CPChem’s share of equity in income of affiliates, which is primarily from its foreign joint ventures, is reported net of associated foreign income taxes.

CPChem had no material unrecognized tax benefits or any tax reserves for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2019 or 2018. The Company recognizes interest accrued related to uncertain tax positions and any statutory penalties in income taxes. No material interest or penalties were recognized during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, and there were no material accruals for the payment of interest or penalties at December 31, 2019 or 2018.

In addition to CPChem’s U.S. federal and state income tax return informational filings as a flow-through entity, CPChem and its subsidiaries file income tax returns and pay taxes in various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, the examination of tax returns for certain prior years has not been completed. However, income tax examinations have been finalized in the Company’s major tax jurisdictions as follows through the years noted: Belgium (2015), Singapore (2017), United States – State of Texas (2013). CPChem believes that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims for the years still subject to examination will not be material to consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

Distributions

CPChem is required to make quarterly distributions to its members in amounts representing their liability for combined federal and state income taxes calculated at specified rates based on CPChem’s estimate of federal taxable income. The Board has the authority to reduce or suspend 

39

Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - December 31, 2019

such distributions to the members as it deems appropriate. Tax distributions paid to members totaled $88 million in 2019, $4 million in 2018 and $57 million in 2017. Tax distributions of $36 million were accrued at December 31, 2019 and no tax distributions were accrued at December 31, 2018. 

Discretionary distributions may also be paid periodically to the members at the election of the Board, depending upon the Company’s operating results and capital requirements. Discretionary distributions paid to members totaled $1.575 billion in 2019, $2.050 billion in 2018, and $0.600 billion in 2017. There were no discretionary distributions accrued at December 31, 2019 or 2018.
