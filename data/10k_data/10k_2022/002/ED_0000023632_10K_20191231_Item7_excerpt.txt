Other

Taxes, Other Than Income Taxes

Taxes, other than income taxes increased $14 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to the New York State capital tax in 2018.

Other Income (Deductions)

Other income (deductions) decreased $19 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to the transaction costs related to the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC. See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.

Income Tax Expense

Income taxes increased $18 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due primarily to Con Edison’s higher 2017 federal net operating loss carryover into 2018 on the federal tax return ($42 million), the non-recurring deferred state income tax adjustment recorded in 2017 ($7 million) and a decrease in the corporate federal tax rate in 2018 due to TCJA ($2 million), offset in part by the absence of the 2017 federal income tax expense related to the re-measurement of Clean Energy Businesses’ deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the 21 percent corporate income tax rate under the TCJA ($21 million), lower income before income tax expense ($6 million) and lower state income taxes ($6 million). See Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Companies’ liquidity reflects cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as shown on their respective consolidated statements of cash flows and as discussed below.

The principal factors affecting Con Edison’s liquidity are its investments in the Utilities, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission, the dividends it pays to its shareholders and the dividends it receives from the Utilities and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.

The principal factors affecting CECONY’s liquidity are its cash flows from operating activities, cash used in investing activities (including construction expenditures), the dividends it pays to Con Edison and cash flows from financing activities discussed below.

The Companies generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Companies repay their short-term borrowings using funds from long-term financings and operating activities. The Utilities’ cost of capital, including working capital, is reflected in the rates they charge to their customers.

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201971

Each of the Companies believes that it will be able to meet its reasonably likely short-term and long-term cash requirements. See “The Companies Require Access to Capital Markets to Satisfy Funding Requirements,” "Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies" and “The Companies Also Face Other Risks That Are Beyond Their Control” in Item 1A, and “Capital Requirements and Resources” in Item 1.

(c) See "Reconciliation of Cash, Temporary Cash Investments and Restricted Cash" in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. 

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201973

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

The Utilities’ cash flows from operating activities reflect primarily their energy sales and deliveries and cost of operations. The volume of energy sales and deliveries is affected primarily by factors external to the Utilities, such as growth of customer demand, weather, market prices for energy and economic conditions. Measures that promote distributed energy resources, such as distributed generation, demand reduction and energy efficiency, also affect the volume of energy sales and deliveries. See "Utility Regulation – State Utility Regulation – New York Utility Industry – Reforming the Energy Vision," "Competition" and "Environmental Matters – Climate Change" in Item 1. Under the revenue decoupling mechanisms in the Utilities’ New York electric and gas rate plans, changes in delivery volumes from levels assumed when rates were approved may affect the timing of cash flows, but generally not net income. The prices at which the Utilities provide energy to their customers are determined in accordance with their rate plans. In general, changes in the Utilities’ cost of purchased power, fuel and gas may affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, because the costs are recovered in accordance with rate plans. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8. Pursuant to their rate plans, the Utilities have recovered from customers a portion of the tax liability they will pay in the future as a result of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities. These temporary differences affect the timing of cash flows, but not net income, as the Companies are required to record deferred tax assets and liabilities at the current corporate tax rate for the temporary differences. For the Utilities, credits to their customers of the net benefits of the TCJA, including the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 21 percent, decrease cash flows from operating activities. See “Changes To Tax Laws Could Adversely Affect the Companies,” in Item 1A, “Federal Income Tax” in Note A, “Rate Plans” in Note B, “Other Regulatory Matters” in Note B and Note L to the financial statements in Item 8.

Net income is the result of cash and non-cash (or accrual) transactions. Only cash transactions affect the Companies’ cash flows from operating activities. Principal non-cash charges or credits include depreciation, deferred income tax expense, amortizations of certain regulatory assets and liabilities and accrued unbilled revenue. Non-cash charges or credits may also be accrued under the revenue decoupling and cost reconciliation mechanisms in the Utilities’ New York electric and gas rate plans. See “Rate Plans – CECONY– Electric and Gas" and "Rate Plans – O&R New York – Electric and Gas” in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. For Con Edison, 2018 net income also included a non-cash gain recognized with respect to jointly-owned renewable energy production projects upon completion of the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC at the Clean Energy Businesses ($131 million). See Note U to the financial statements in Item 8.

Net cash flows from operating activities in 2019 for Con Edison and CECONY were $439 million and $298 million higher, respectively, than in 2018. The changes in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflect primarily lower pension and retiree benefit contributions ($122 million and $115 million, respectively), lower storm restoration costs ($192 million and $132 million, respectively), lower MTA power reliability costs ($160 million and $160 million, respectively), reimbursement received for restoration costs related to the restoration of power in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of the September 2017 hurricanes ($95 million and $89 million, respectively), and for CECONY, lower net payments of income tax to affiliated companies ($122 million), offset, in part, by higher TCJA net benefits provided to customers in the 2019 period ($379 million and $376 million, respectively). 

Net cash flows from operating activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $672 million and $662 million lower, respectively, than in 2017. The change in net cash flows for Con Edison and CECONY reflects primarily cash payments for MTA power reliability costs ($179 million and $179 million, respectively) and Puerto Rico related restoration costs ($104 million and $98 million, respectively), storm restoration costs ($193 million and $133 million, respectively), higher accounts receivable from customers ($149 million and $168 million, respectively) primarily due to an increase in billed revenues for gas, higher pension and retiree benefit obligations ($89 million and $77 million, respectively), and lower income tax refunds received, net of income taxes paid ($29 million and $87 million, respectively). The change in net cash flows for CECONY also reflects an increase in accounts receivables from affiliated companies ($195 million) primarily related to estimated federal income tax payments for 2018 exceeding the accrued income tax liability at year end and CECONY’s ability to use its 2017 net operating loss carryover in 2018. These changes are offset in part by the cash impact of the Utilities’ estimated net benefits in the 2018 period under the TCJA ($434 million and $411 million, respectively). See “Assets, Liabilities and Equity,” below.

The change in net cash flows also reflects the timing of payments for and recovery of energy costs. This timing is reflected within changes to accounts receivable – customers, recoverable and refundable energy costs within other regulatory assets and liabilities and accounts payable balances.

Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities

Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,689 million and $182 million lower, respectively, in 2019 than in 2018. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC, net of cash acquired, at the Clean Energy Businesses in 2018 ($1,488 million) (see Note U to the 

74CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2019

financial statements in Item 8) and proceeds received in 2019 from the sale of properties formerly used by CECONY in its operations ($187 million).

Net cash flows used in investing activities for Con Edison and CECONY were $1,761 million and $226 million higher, respectively, in 2018 than in 2017. The change for Con Edison reflects primarily the acquisition of Sempra Solar Holdings, LLC, net of cash acquired, at the Clean Energy Businesses ($1,488 million) (see Note U to the financial statements in Item 8), higher new investments in electric and gas transmission projects at Con Edison Transmission ($204 million) and increased utility construction expenditures at CECONY ($211 million) and O&R ($10 million), offset in part by lower non-utility construction expenditures at the Clean Energy Businesses ($169 million).

Cash Flows From Financing Activities

Net cash flows from financing activities in 2019 for Con Edison and CECONY were $2,079 million and $453 million lower, respectively, than in 2018. Net cash flows from financing activities in 2018 for Con Edison and CECONY were $2,581 million and $950 million higher, respectively, than in 2017.

The change in long-term debt reflects primarily the November 2019 issuance of $43 million and December 2019 issuances of $82 million of debentures. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Cash Flows From Financing Activities" above.

Equity at December 31, 2019 was $50 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in equity reflects net income for the year ($70 million) and a capital contribution from parent ($30 million) in 2019, offset, in part, by common stock dividends to parent ($47 million) in 2019 and a decrease in other comprehensive income ($4 million).

Clean Energy Businesses

Current assets at December 31, 2019 were $139 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in current assets reflects primarily increases in restricted cash.

78CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Net plant at December 31, 2019 was $27 million lower than at December 31, 2018. The change in net plant reflects primarily depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2019, investment tax credits and the reduction in the capitalized asset and related liability for asset retirement obligations for certain property leased by renewable electric production projects, offset, in part, by additional capital expenditures.

Other noncurrent assets at December 31, 2019 were $160 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in other noncurrent assets reflects primarily the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” See Note J to the to the financial statements in Item 8.

Current liabilities at December 31, 2019 were $83 million lower than at December 31, 2018. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily the repayment of a borrowing under a 6-month term loan agreement with the proceeds of a 2-year term loan agreement ($825 million) and a decrease in working capital requirements primarily due to the funding of the California Holdings 4 project debt ($187 million), offset, in part, by the reclassification of the PG&E-related project debt from long-term debt to long-term debt due within one year ($990 million). See "Long-Term Debt" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.

Noncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2019 were $233 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 “Leases (Topic 842)" and a decrease in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, which reflects primarily accelerated depreciation on renewable energy projects and the utilization of federal net operating loss carryforwards, offset, in part, by the reduction in the capitalized asset and related liability for asset retirement obligations for certain property leased by renewable electric production projects and See Note J to the financial statements in Item 8.

Long-term debt at December 31, 2019 was $70 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in long-term debt primarily reflects a May 2019 borrowing of $464 million, due 2026, secured by equity interests in solar electric production projects, and an October 2019 issuance of $303 million, due 2038, secured by the company's California Solar 4 renewable electric production projects, offset, in part, by the reclassification of the PG&E-related project debt to long-term debt due within one year ($990 million) and the repayment to parent of $450 million of an $825 million borrowing. See "Long-Lived and Intangible Assets" in Note A and "Long-Term Debt" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.

Equity at December 31, 2019 was $52 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in equity reflects primarily an increase in noncontrolling interest ($78 million), offset, in part, by a net loss for the for the year ($18 million) and common stock dividends to parent ($3 million) in 2019.

CET

Current assets at December 31, 2019 were $30 million lower than at December 31, 2018. The change in current assets reflects an increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC and a NY Transco electric transmission project. See "Con Edison Transmission - CET Gas" in Item 1. 

Investments at December 31, 2019 were $223 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in investments reflects primarily increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC and a NY Transco electric transmission project. See "Investments" in Note A and Note U to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Current liabilities at December 31, 2019 were $130 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in current liabilities reflects primarily an increase in payables to associate companies related to increased investment in Mountain Valley Pipeline, LLC.

Noncurrent liabilities at December 31, 2019 was $22 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in noncurrent liabilities reflects primarily an increase in deferred income taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, which reflects primarily accelerated tax depreciation and repair deductions. 

Equity at December 31, 2019 was $41 million higher than at December 31, 2018. The change in equity reflects net income for the year ($52 million), offset, in part, by common stock dividends to parent ($12 million) in 2019.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In May 2019, Con Edison entered into a forward sale agreement which met the SEC definition of an off-balance sheet arrangement, which the company physically settled by issuing 4,750,000 shares of its common stock in June 2019 and 1,050,000 shares in January 2020. See Note C to the financial statements in Item 8 for more information 

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201979

on this agreement. None of the Companies’ other transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements meet the SEC definition of off-balance sheet arrangements.

Regulatory Matters

For information about the Utilities’ rate plans and other regulatory matters affecting the Companies, see “Utility Regulation” in Item 1 and Note B to the financial statements in Item 8.

Risk Factors

The Companies’ businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, and that involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual operating results, cash flows and financial condition. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

The Companies’ financial statements reflect the application of their accounting policies, which conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The Companies’ critical accounting policies include industry-specific accounting applicable to regulated public utilities and accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits, contingencies, long-lived assets, goodwill and derivative instruments.

Accounting for Regulated Public Utilities

The Utilities are subject to the accounting rules for regulated operations and the accounting requirements of the FERC and the state public utility regulatory commissions having jurisdiction.

The accounting rules for regulated operations specify the economic effects that result from the causal relationship of costs and revenues in the rate-regulated environment and how these effects are to be accounted for by a regulated enterprise. Revenues intended to cover some costs may be recorded either before or after the costs are incurred. If regulation provides assurance that incurred costs will be recovered in the future, these costs would be recorded as deferred charges, or “regulatory assets,” under the accounting rules for regulated operations. If revenues are recorded for costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, these revenues would be recorded as deferred credits, or “regulatory liabilities,” under the accounting rules for regulated operations.

The Utilities’ principal regulatory assets and liabilities are listed in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8. The Utilities are receiving or being credited with a return on all of their regulatory assets for which a cash outflow has been made. The Utilities are paying or being charged with a return on all of their regulatory liabilities for which a cash inflow has been received. The Utilities' regulatory assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 are recoverable from customers, or to be applied for customer benefit, in accordance with rate provisions that have been approved by the applicable public utility regulatory commission.

In the event that regulatory assets of the Utilities were no longer probable of recovery, as required by the accounting rules for regulated operations, these regulatory assets would be charged to earnings. At December 31, 2019, the regulatory assets for Con Edison and CECONY were $4,987 million and $4,600 million, respectively.

Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits

The Utilities provide pensions and other postretirement benefits to substantially all of their employees and retirees. The Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission also provide such benefits to transferred employees who previously worked for the Utilities. The Companies account for these benefits in accordance with the accounting rules for retirement benefits. In addition, the Utilities apply the accounting rules for regulated operations to account for the regulatory treatment of these obligations (which, as described in Note B to the financial statements in Item 8, reconciles the amounts reflected in rates for the costs of the benefit to the costs actually incurred). In applying these accounting policies, the Companies have made critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions, including assumptions of expected returns on plan assets, discount rates, health care cost trends and future compensation. See Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8 for information about the Companies’ pension and other postretirement benefits, the actuarial assumptions, actual performance, amortization of investment and other actuarial gains and losses and calculated plan costs for 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The discount rate for determining the present value of future period benefit payments is determined using a model to match the durations of highly-rated (Aa or higher by either Moody’s or S&P) corporate bonds with the projected stream of benefit payments.

80CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2019

In determining the health care cost trend rate, the Companies review actual recent cost trends and projected future trends.

The cost of pension and other postretirement benefits in future periods will depend on actual returns on plan assets, assumptions for future periods, contributions and benefit experience. Con Edison’s and CECONY’s current estimates for 2020 are increases, compared with 2019, in their pension and other postretirement benefits costs of $160 million and $151 million, respectively.

The following table illustrates the effect on 2020 pension and other postretirement costs of changing the critical actuarial assumptions, while holding all other actuarial assumptions constant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A 5.0 percentage point variation in the actual annual return in 2020, as compared with the expected annual asset return of 7.00 percent, would change pension and other postretirement benefit costs for Con Edison and CECONY by approximately $27 million and $25 million, respectively, in 2021.

Pension benefits are provided through a pension plan maintained by Con Edison to which CECONY, O&R, the Clean Energy Businesses and Con Edison Transmission make contributions for their participating employees. Pension accounting by the Utilities includes an allocation of plan assets.

The Companies’ policy is to fund their pension and other postretirement benefit accounting costs to the extent tax deductible, and for the Utilities, to the extent these costs are recovered under their rate plans. The Companies were not required to make cash contributions to the pension plan in 2019 under funding regulations and tax laws. However, CECONY and O&R made discretionary contributions to the pension plan in 2019 of $318 million and $32 million, respectively. In 2020, CECONY and O&R expect to make contributions to the pension plan of $433 million and $39 million, respectively. See “Expected Contributions” in Notes E and F to the financial statements in Item 8.

Accounting for Contingencies

The accounting rules for contingencies apply to an existing condition, situation or set of circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Known material contingencies, which are described in the notes to the financial statements, include certain regulatory matters (Note B), the Utilities’ responsibility for hazardous substances, such as asbestos, PCBs and coal tar that have been used or generated in the course of operations (Note G) and other contingencies (Note H). In accordance with the accounting rules, the Companies have accrued estimates of losses relating to the 

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201981

contingencies as to which loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and no liability has been accrued for contingencies as to which loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated.

The Utilities recover costs for asbestos lawsuits, workers’ compensation and environmental remediation pursuant to their current rate plans. Generally, changes during the terms of the rate plans to the amounts accrued for these contingencies would not impact earnings.

Accounting for Long-Lived and Intangible Assets

The accounting rules for certain long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives require testing for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of a long-lived asset or intangible asset with a definite life is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Under the accounting rules, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from such cash flows, and exceeds its fair value, which approximates market value. 

In January 2019, PG&E filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The output of certain of the Clean Energy Businesses' PG&E Projects is sold under PG&E PPAs. At December 31, 2019, Con Edison’s consolidated balance sheet included $819 million of net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects, $1,057 million of intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs, $282 million of net non-utility plant of additional projects that secure the related project debt and $1,001 million of related project debt. Con Edison has tested whether its net non-utility plant relating to the PG&E Projects and intangible assets relating to the PG&E PPAs have been impaired. Based on the test, Con Edison has determined that there was no impairment. For other long-lived assets or intangible assets with definite lives, Con Edison recorded $2 million of impairment charges in 2018, and no impairment charges were recorded in 2019 or 2017. See “Clean Energy Businesses - Renewable Electric Production,” in Item 1 and “Long-Lived and Intangible Assets” in Note A and "Long-term Debt" in Note C to the financial statements in Item 8.

Accounting for Goodwill

In accordance with the accounting rules for goodwill and intangible assets, Con Edison is required to test goodwill for impairment annually or whenever there is a triggering event. The company has an option to first make a qualitative assessment that evaluates relevant events and circumstances, such as industry and market conditions, regulatory environment and financial performance. If, after applying the optional qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the company then applies a two-step, quantitative goodwill impairment test. At December 31, 2019, Con Edison’s consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $446 million. No material impairment charges on goodwill were recognized in 2019, 2018 or 2017. See “Goodwill” in Note A and Note K to the financial statements in Item 8. 

Accounting for Derivative Instruments

The Companies apply the accounting rules for derivatives and hedging to their derivative financial instruments. The Companies use derivative financial instruments to hedge market price fluctuations in related underlying transactions for the physical purchase and sale of electricity and gas. The Utilities are permitted by their respective regulators to reflect in rates all reasonably incurred gains and losses on these instruments. The Clean Energy Businesses have also hedged interest rate risk on certain debt securities. See “Financial and Commodity Market Risks,” below and Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.

Where the Companies are required to make mark-to-market estimates pursuant to the accounting rules, the estimates of gains and losses at a particular period end do not reflect the end results of particular transactions, and will most likely not reflect the actual gain or loss at the conclusion of a transaction. Substantially all of the estimated gains or losses are based on prices supplied by external sources such as the fair value of exchange-traded futures and options and the fair value of positions for which price quotations are available through or derived from brokers or other market sources.

Financial and Commodity Market Risks

The Companies are subject to various risks and uncertainties associated with financial and commodity markets. The most significant market risks include interest rate risk, commodity price risk and investment risk.

82CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 2019

Interest Rate Risk

The Companies' interest rate risk relates primarily to new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements, including the construction expenditures of the Utilities and maturing debt securities, and variable-rate debt. Con Edison and its subsidiaries manage interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed-rate debt with varying maturities and through opportunistic refinancing of debt. The Clean Energy Businesses also use interest rate swaps. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8. Con Edison and CECONY estimate that at December 31, 2019, a 10 percent increase in interest rates applicable to its variable rate debt would result in an increase in annual interest expense of $7 million and $4 million, respectively. Under CECONY’s current electric, gas and steam rate plans, variations in actual variable rate tax-exempt debt interest expense, including costs associated with the refinancing of the variable-rate tax-exempt debt, are reconciled to levels reflected in rates.

Commodity Price Risk

Con Edison’s commodity price risk relates primarily to the purchase and sale of electricity, gas and related derivative instruments. The Utilities and the Clean Energy Businesses apply risk management strategies to mitigate their related exposures. See Note O to the financial statements in Item 8.

Con Edison estimates that, as of December 31, 2019, a 10 percent decline in market prices would result in a decline in fair value of $81 million for the derivative instruments used by the Utilities to hedge purchases of electricity and gas, of which $76 million is for CECONY and $5 million is for O&R. Con Edison expects that any such change in fair value would be largely offset by directionally opposite changes in the cost of the electricity and gas purchased. In accordance with provisions approved by state regulators, the Utilities generally recover from customers the costs they incur for energy purchased for their customers, including gains and losses on certain derivative instruments used to hedge energy purchased and related costs. See “Recoverable Energy Costs” in Note A to the financial statements in Item 8.

The Clean Energy Businesses use a value-at-risk (VaR) model to assess the market price risk of their portfolio of electricity and gas commodity fixed-price purchase and sales commitments, physical forward contracts, generating assets and commodity derivative instruments. VaR represents the potential change in fair value of the portfolio due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level. These businesses estimate VaR across their portfolio using a delta-normal variance/covariance model with a 95 percent confidence level, compare the measured VaR results against performance due to actual prices and stress test the portfolio each quarter using an assumed 30 percent price change from forecast. Since the VaR calculation involves complex methodologies and estimates and assumptions that are based on past experience, it is not necessarily indicative of future results. VaR for the portfolio, assuming a one-day holding period, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investment Risk

The Companies’ investment risk relates to the investment of plan assets for their pension and other postretirement benefit plans and to the investments of Con Edison Transmission that are accounted for under the equity method. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies – Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,” above and Notes A, E and F to the financial statements in Item 8. 

The Companies’ current investment policy for pension plan assets includes investment targets of 45 to 55 percent equity securities, 33 to 43 percent debt securities and 10 to 14 percent real estate. At December 31, 2019, the pension plan investments consisted of 51 percent equity securities, 38 percent debt securities and 11 percent real estate.

For the Utilities’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans, regulatory accounting treatment is generally applied in accordance with the accounting rules for regulated operations. In accordance with the Statement of Policy issued by the NYSPSC and its current electric, gas and steam rate plans, CECONY defers for payment to or recovery from 

CON EDISON ANNUAL REPORT 201983

customers the difference between the pension and other postretirement benefit expenses and the amounts for such expenses reflected in rates. O&R also defers such difference pursuant to its New York rate plans.

Environmental Matters

For information concerning climate change, environmental sustainability, potential liabilities arising from laws and regulations protecting the environment and other environmental matters, see “Environmental Matters” in Item 1 and Note G to the financial statements in Item 8.

Impact of Inflation

The Companies are affected by the decline in the purchasing power of the dollar caused by inflation. Regulation permits the Utilities to recover through depreciation only the historical cost of their plant assets even though in an inflationary economy the cost to replace the assets upon their retirement will substantially exceed historical costs. The impact is, however, partially offset by the repayment of the Companies’ long-term debt in dollars of lesser value than the dollars originally borrowed.

Material Contingencies

For information concerning potential liabilities arising from the Companies’ material contingencies, see “Application of Critical Accounting Policies – Accounting for Contingencies,” above, and Notes B, G and H to the financial statements in Item 8.
