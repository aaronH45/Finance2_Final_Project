ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") is based upon the consolidated financial statements of Eastman Chemical Company ("Eastman" or the "Company"), which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted ("GAAP") in the United States, and should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"). All references to earnings per share ("EPS") contained in this report are to diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. EBIT is the GAAP measure earnings before interest and taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

In preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures. Such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingencies. On an ongoing basis, Eastman evaluates its estimates, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, environmental costs, pension and other postretirement benefits, litigation and contingent liabilities, and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes the critical accounting estimates described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the Company's financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most significant judgments in the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Definite-lived Assets

Properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets to be held and used by Eastman are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The review of properties and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets is performed at the asset group level, which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amount is not considered to be recoverable, an analysis of fair value is triggered. An impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants. The Company's assumptions related to long-lived assets are subject to change and impairments may be required in the future. If estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised, the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted, resulting in a charge to earnings.

Goodwill

Eastman conducts testing of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The testing of goodwill is performed at the "reporting unit" level which the Company has determined to be its "components". Components are defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, and in order to be a reporting unit, the component must 1) be a "business" as defined by applicable accounting standards (an integrated set of activities and assets that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return in the form of dividends, lower costs, or other economic benefits directly to the investors or other owners, members, or participants); 2) have discrete financial information available; and 3) be reviewed regularly by Company operating segment management. The Company aggregates certain components into reporting units based on economic similarities. 

A reporting unit's goodwill is considered to be impaired when the reporting unit's estimated fair value is less than its carrying value. The Company uses an income approach and applies a discounted cash flow model in testing the carrying value of goodwill for each reporting unit. Key assumptions and estimates used in the Company's 2019 goodwill impairment testing included projections of revenues and EBIT determined using the Company's annual multi-year strategic plan, the estimated weighted average cost of capital ("WACC"), and a projected long-term growth rate. The Company believes these assumptions are consistent with those a hypothetical market participant would use given circumstances that were present at the time the estimates were made. However, actual results and amounts may be significantly different from the Company's estimates. In addition, the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in materially different estimated fair values of reporting units. The WACC is calculated incorporating weighted average returns on debt and equity from market participants. Therefore, changes in the market, which are beyond the control of the Company, may have an impact on future calculations of estimated fair value. For additional information, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

29

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

As a result of the goodwill impairment testing performed during fourth quarter 2019, fair values were determined to exceed the carrying values for each reporting unit tested with the exception of crop protection (part of the Additives & Functional Products operating segment as described in Part I, Item 1, "Business", of this Annual Report). The Company reduced the carrying value of the crop protection reporting unit to its estimated fair value through recognition of a $45 million goodwill impairment. The impairment was primarily due to the impact of recent regulatory changes in the European Union on the current period and forecasted revenue and EBIT and a decrease in the long-term growth rate assumed in the goodwill impairment model. Two of the most critical assumptions used in the calculation of the fair value of the crop protection reporting unit are the target market long-term growth rate and the WACC. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis of both of those assumptions, assuming a one percent decrease in the expected long-term growth rate or a one percent increase in the WACC, and both scenarios independently yielded an estimated fair value for the crop protection reporting unit below carrying value. The crop protection reporting unit's goodwill after the reduction for impairment was $190 million as of December 31, 2019.

Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

Eastman conducts testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently when events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The carrying value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is considered to be impaired when the fair value, as established by appraisal or based on discounted future cash flows of certain related products, is less than the respective carrying value. 

Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting primarily of various tradenames, are tested for potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value to the carrying amount. The Company uses an income approach, specifically the relief from royalty method, to test indefinite-lived intangible assets. The estimated fair value of tradenames is determined based on an assumed royalty rate savings, discounted by the calculated market participant WACC plus a risk premium. 

The Company had $537 million in indefinite-lived intangible assets at the time of impairment testing. There was no impairment of the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the tests performed during fourth quarter 2019. 

The Company will continue to monitor both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for any indication of events which might require additional testing before the next annual impairment test.

For additional information, see Note 3, "Properties and Accumulated Depreciation", Note 4, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets", and Note 15, "Asset Impairments and Restructuring Charges, Net", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Environmental Costs

Eastman recognizes environmental remediation costs when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability at a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company recognizes the minimum undiscounted amount. This undiscounted amount reflects liabilities expected to be paid within approximately 30 years and the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs. Estimated future environmental expenditures for undiscounted remediation costs ranged from the best estimate or minimum of $260 million to the maximum of $487 million and from the best estimate or minimum of $271 million to the maximum of $508 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The best estimate or minimum estimated future environmental expenditures are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable and include the amounts recognized at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

30

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company also establishes reserves for closure and post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets it maintains. Environmental assets include but are not limited to waste management units, such as landfills, water treatment facilities, and surface impoundments. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a loss contingency reserve is established for the anticipated future costs associated with the retirement or closure of the asset based on its expected life and the applicable regulatory closure requirements. The Company recognizes the asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The asset retirement obligations are discounted to expected present value and subsequently adjusted for changes in fair value. These future estimated costs are charged to earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. If the Company changes its estimate of the environmental asset retirement obligation costs or its estimate of the useful lives of these assets, expenses charged to earnings will be impacted. For sites that have environmental asset retirement obligations, the best estimate for these asset retirement obligation costs recognized to date was $27 million and $25 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. 

The Company's total amount reserved for environmental loss contingencies, including the remediation and closure and post-closure costs described above, was $287 million and $296 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. This loss contingency reserve represents the best estimate or minimum for undiscounted remediation costs and the best estimate of the amount accrued to date for discounted asset retirement obligation costs. For additional information, see Note 12, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

Eastman maintains defined benefit pension plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits. Under its other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S., Eastman provides life insurance for eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007. Eastman provides a subsidy for pre-Medicare health care and dental benefits to eligible retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007 that will end on December 31, 2021. Company funding is also provided for eligible Medicare retirees hired prior to January 1, 2007 with a health reimbursement arrangement. The estimated amounts of the costs and obligations related to these benefits primarily reflect the Company's assumptions related to discount rates and expected return on plan assets. For valuing the obligations and assets of the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans, the Company assumed weighted average discount rates of 3.25 percent and 1.56 percent, respectively, and weighted average expected returns on plan assets of 7.37 percent and 4.26 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2019. The Company assumed a weighted average discount rate of 3.21 percent for its other postretirement benefit plans. The estimated cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements, mortality, turnover, and plan participation.

The Company performed a five-year experience study of the assumptions for the U.S. plans in 2017 which included a review of the mortality tables. As a result of the experience study, the Company has updated the mortality assumptions used to a modified RP-2017 table with modified MP-2017 improvement scale and no collar adjustment. 

The projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 expense are affected by year-end 2019 assumptions. The following table illustrates the sensitivity to changes in the Company's long-term assumptions in the assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The sensitivities below are specific to the time periods noted. They also may not be additive, so the impact of changing multiple factors simultaneously cannot be calculated by combining the individual sensitivities shown. 

31

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The assumed discount rate and expected return on plan assets used to calculate the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are established each December 31. The assumed discount rate is based upon a portfolio of high-grade corporate bonds, which are used to develop a yield curve. This yield curve is applied to the expected cash flows of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Because future health care benefits under the U.S. benefit plan have been fixed at a certain contribution amount, changes in the health care cost trend assumptions do not have a material impact on results of operations. The expected return on plan assets is based upon prior performance and the long-term expected returns in the markets in which the plans invest their funds, primarily in U.S. and non-U.S. fixed income securities, U.S. and non-U.S. public equity securities, private equity, and real estate. Moreover, the expected return on plan assets is a long-term assumption and on average is expected to approximate the actual return on plan assets. Actual returns will be subject to year-to-year variances and could vary materially from assumptions. 

The Company calculates service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its significant defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows. This cost approach does not affect the measurement of the total benefit obligation or the annual net periodic benefit cost or credit of the plans because the change in the service and interest costs will be offset in the mark-to-market ("MTM") actuarial gain or loss. The MTM gain or loss, as described in the next paragraph, is typically recognized in the fourth quarter of each year or in any other quarters in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. For additional information, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The Company uses fair value accounting for plan assets. If actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, primarily discount rates and long-term assumptions for asset returns which were used in determining the current year expense, the difference is recognized as part of the MTM net gain or loss in fourth quarter each year, and any other quarter in which an interim remeasurement is triggered. The MTM net gain or loss applied to net earnings in 2019, 2018, and 2017 due to the actual experience versus actuarial assumptions for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans were a net loss of $143 million, a net loss of $99 million, and a net gain of $21 million, respectively. The 2019 MTM net loss includes an actuarial loss of approximately $385 million, resulting primarily from the Company's December 31, 2019 weighted-average assumed discount rate of 2.80 percent, which is lower than for the prior year, and changes in other actuarial assumptions. Overall asset values increased approximately $240 million due to asset values appreciating in excess of the assumed weighted-average rate of return. The actual gain was approximately $405 million, or approximately 15 percent, which was above the expected return of approximately $165 million, or approximately 6 percent.

32

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

While changes in obligations do not correspond directly to cash funding requirements, it is an indication of the amount the Company will be required to contribute to the plans in future years. The amount and timing of such cash contributions is dependent upon interest rates, actual returns on plan assets, retirements, attrition rates of employees, and other factors. For further information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, see Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Litigation and Contingent Liabilities

From time to time, Eastman and its operations are parties to, or targets of, lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including product liability, personal injury, asbestos, patent and intellectual property, commercial, contract, environmental, antitrust, health and safety, and employment matters, which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business. The Company accrues a contingent loss liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range, the Company recognizes the minimum amount. The Company expenses legal costs, including those expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency, as incurred. Based upon currently available facts, the Company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters; however, results of operations could be adversely affected by monetary damages, costs or expenses, and charges against its overall financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows in particular periods. 

Income Taxes

Amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities on Eastman's Consolidated Statements of Financial Position are based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The ability to realize deferred tax assets is evaluated through the forecasting of taxable income and domestic and foreign taxes, using historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, and the availability of tax planning opportunities. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. In the event that the actual outcome of future tax consequences differs from management estimates and assumptions, the resulting change to the provision for (benefit from) income taxes could have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations and statements of financial position. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, valuation allowances of $453 million and $487 million, respectively, have been provided against the deferred tax assets. 

The calculation of income tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal interpretation and management judgment. Eastman's income tax returns are regularly examined by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, and those audits may result in proposed adjustments. The Company has evaluated these potential issues under the more-likely-than-not standard of the accounting literature. A tax position is recognized if it meets this standard and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. Such judgments and estimates may change based on audit settlements, court cases and interpretation of tax laws and regulations. Income tax expense could be materially impacted to the extent the Company prevails in a tax position or when the statute of limitations expires for a tax position for which a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances have been established, or to the extent payments are required in excess of the established liability for unrecognized tax benefits. 

The Company accrues interest related to unrecognized income tax positions, which is included as a component of the income tax provision on the balance sheet. For further information, see Note 7, "Income Taxes", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

Non-GAAP financial measures, and the accompanying reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP measures, are presented below in this section and in "Overview", "Results of Operations", "Summary by Operating Segment", "Liquidity and Other Financial Information", and "Outlook" in this MD&A.

Management discloses non-GAAP financial measures because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess the Company's and its operating segments' performances, make resource allocation decisions, and evaluate organizational and individual performances in determining certain performance-based compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures do not have definitions under GAAP, and may be defined differently by, and not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on any non-GAAP financial measure, but to consider such measures alongside the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Company Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-Core Items and any Unusual or Non-Recurring Items Excluded from Non-GAAP Earnings

In addition to evaluating Eastman's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows as reported in accordance with GAAP, management also evaluates Company and operating segment performance, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions, excluding the effect of transactions, costs, and losses or gains that do not directly result from Eastman's normal, or "core", business and operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. 

•Non-core transactions, costs, and losses or gains relate to, among other things, cost reductions, growth and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of core business operations, and have included asset impairments and restructuring charges and gains, costs of and related to acquisitions, gains and losses from and costs related to dispositions, closure, or shutdowns of businesses or assets, financing transaction costs, and MTM losses or gains for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. 

•In 2018 the Company recognized unusual income from insurance in excess of costs for, and in 2017 recognized unusual net costs of, the disruption, repairs, and reconstruction of the Kingsport site's coal gasification operations area resulting from the previously reported October 4, 2017 explosion (the "coal gasification incident"). Management considers the coal gasification incident unusual because of the Company's operational and safety history and the magnitude of the unplanned disruption.

•In 2018 the Company recognized unusual costs and in both 2019 and 2018 unusual net decreases to earnings from adjustments of the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017, resulting from tax law changes, primarily the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "Tax Reform Act"), and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the transition to an international treasury services center. Management considers these actions and associated costs and income unusual because of the infrequent nature of such changes in tax law and resulting actions and the significant impacts on earnings.

Because non-core, unusual, or non-recurring transactions, costs, and losses or gains may materially affect the Company's, or any particular operating segment's, financial condition or results in a specific period in which they are recognized, management believes it is appropriate to evaluate the financial measures prepared and calculated in accordance with both GAAP and the related non-GAAP financial measures excluding the effect on the Company's results of these non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. In addition to using such measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management evaluates such non-GAAP measures, and believes that investors may also evaluate such measures, because such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's, and its segments', operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and, as a result, provide a better indication of expected future trends.

34

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Adjusted Tax Rate and Provision for Income Taxes

In interim periods, Eastman discloses non-GAAP earnings with an adjusted effective tax rate and a resulting adjusted provision for income taxes using the Company's forecasted tax rate for the full year as of the end of the interim period. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes are equal to the Company's projected full year effective tax rate and provision for income taxes on earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items for completed periods. The adjusted effective tax rate and resulting adjusted provision for income taxes may fluctuate during the year for changes in events and circumstances that change the Company's forecasted annual effective tax rate and resulting provision for income taxes excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Management discloses this adjusted effective tax rate, and the related reconciliation to the GAAP effective tax rate, to provide investors more complete and consistent comparisons of the Company's operational performance on a period-over-period interim basis and on the same basis as management evaluates quarterly financial results to provide a better indication of expected full year results. 

Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure

Eastman regularly evaluates and discloses to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow", which management defines as net cash provided by operating activities, less the amount of net capital expenditures (typically the GAAP measure additions to properties and equipment, and in 2018 net of proceeds from property insurance). Such net capital expenditures are generally funded from available cash and, as such, management believes they should be considered in determining free cash flow. Management believes this is an appropriate metric to assess the Company's ability to fund priorities for uses of available cash. The priorities for cash after funding operations include payment of quarterly dividends, repayment of debt, funding targeted growth opportunities, and repurchasing shares. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in order to provide them with information similar to that used by management in evaluating financial performance and potential future cash available for various initiatives and assessing organizational performance in determining certain performance-based compensation and because management believes investors and securities analysts often use a similar measure of free cash flow to compare the results, and value, of comparable companies. In addition, Eastman may disclose to investors and securities analysts an alternative non-GAAP measure of "free cash flow yield", which management defines as annual free cash flow divided by the Company's market capitalization. Management believes this metric is useful to investors and securities analysts in comparing cash flow generation with that of peer and other companies.

Non-GAAP Measures in this Annual Report

The following non-core items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report:

•MTM pension and other postretirement benefit plans gains and losses resulting from the changes in discount rates and other actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets during the period;

•Asset impairments and restructuring charges, including severance costs and site closure or shutdown charges, net, of which asset impairments are non-cash transactions impacting profitability;

•Early debt extinguishment and other related costs resulting from repayment of borrowings;

•Cost of disposition of claims against operations that were discontinued by Solutia, Inc. ("Solutia") prior to the Company's acquisition of Solutia in 2012;

•Gain from sale of the formulated electronics cleaning solutions business, which was part of the Additives & Functional Products segment; and

•Tax benefit associated with a previously impaired site.

The following unusual items are excluded by management in its evaluation of certain earnings results in this Annual Report:

•Costs of, and income from insurance for, the coal gasification incident;

•Costs of currency transaction and professional fees resulting from fourth quarter 2017 tax law changes and related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations; and

•Estimated net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and tax impact of related outside-U.S. entity reorganizations and related subsequent adjustments recognized in 2018 and 2019.

As described above, the alternative non-GAAP measure "free cash flow" is presented in this Annual Report.

•EBIT,

•Provision for (benefit from) income taxes,

•Net earnings attributable to Eastman,

•Diluted EPS, and

•Net cash provided by operating activities.

Other Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Alternative Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measure

In addition to the non-GAAP measures presented in this Annual Report and other periodic reports, management occasionally has evaluated and disclosed to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP measure cash provided by or used in operating activities excluding certain non-core, unusual, or non-recurring sources or uses of cash or including cash from or used by activities that are managed as part of core business operations ("adjusted cash provided by or used in operating activities") when analyzing, among other things, business performance, liquidity and financial position, and performance-based compensation. Management has used this non-GAAP measure in conjunction with the GAAP measure cash provided by or used in operating activities because it believes it is an appropriate metric to evaluate the cash flows from Eastman's core operations that are available for organic and inorganic growth initiatives and because it allows for a more consistent period-over-period presentation of such amounts. In its evaluation, management generally excludes the impact of certain non-core activities and decisions of management that it considers not core, ongoing components of operations and the decisions to undertake or not to undertake such activities may be made irrespective of the cash generated from operations, and generally includes cash from or used in activities that are managed as operating activities and in business operating decisions. Management has disclosed this non-GAAP measure and the related reconciliation to investors and securities analysts to allow them to better understand and evaluate the information used by management in its decision-making processes and because management believes investors and securities analysts use similar measures to assess Company performance, liquidity, and financial position over multiple periods and to compare these with other companies.

Alternative Non-GAAP Earnings Measures

From time to time, Eastman may also disclose to investors and securities analysts the non-GAAP earnings measures "EBIT Margin", "Adjusted EBITDA", "EBITDA Margin", and "Return on Invested Capital" (or "ROIC"). Management defines EBIT Margin as the GAAP measure EBIT adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's income statement for the same period. Adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA (net earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) adjusted to exclude the same non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items as are excluded from the Company's other non-GAAP earnings measures for the same periods. EBITDA Margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by the GAAP measure sales revenue in the Company's income statement for the same periods. Management defines ROIC as net earnings plus interest expense after tax divided by average total borrowings plus average stockholders' equity for the periods presented, each derived from the GAAP measures in the Company's financial statements for the periods presented. Management believes that EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and ROIC are useful as supplemental measures in evaluating the performance of and returns from Eastman's operating businesses, and from time to time uses such measures in internal performance calculations. Further, management understands that investors and securities analysts often use similar measures of EBIT Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, EBITDA Margin, and ROIC to compare the results, returns, and value of the Company with those of peer and other companies.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW

Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. Eastman uses an innovation-driven growth model which consists of leveraging world class scalable technology platforms, delivering differentiated application development capabilities, and relentlessly engaging the market. The Company's world class technology platforms form the foundation of sustainable growth by differentiated products through significant scale advantages in research and development ("R&D") and advantaged global market access. Differentiated application development converts market complexity into opportunities for growth and accelerates innovation by enabling a deeper understanding of the value of Eastman's products and how they perform within customers' and end-user products. Key areas of application development include thermoplastic conversion, functional films, coatings formulations, rubber additive formulations, adhesives formulations, nonwovens and textiles, animal nutrition, and chemical and plastics recycling technologies. The Company engages the market by working directly with customers and downstream users, targeting attractive niche markets, and leveraging disruptive macro trends. Management believes that these elements of the Company's innovation-driven growth model, combined with disciplined portfolio management and balanced capital deployment, will result in consistent, sustainable earnings growth and strong cash flow.

The Company generated sales revenue of $9.3 billion and $10.2 billion for 2019 and 2018, respectively. EBIT was $1.1 billion and $1.6 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the non-core and unusual items referenced in "Non-GAAP Financial Measures", adjusted EBIT was $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Discussion of sales revenue and EBIT changes is presented in "Results of Operations" and "Summary by Operating Segment" in this MD&A.

Net earnings and EPS and adjusted net earnings and EPS were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities in both 2019 and 2018. Free cash flow was $1.1 billion in both 2019 and 2018.

As previously reported, in fourth quarter 2017 an explosion in the Kingsport site's coal gasification area disrupted manufacturing operations, primarily for the Fibers and CI segments which are significant internal users of cellulose and acetyl stream intermediates. The incident, net of insurance, reduced 2017 earnings by $112 million and increased 2018 earnings by $83 million. The cumulative net costs of the incident were $29 million. Costs net of insurance of the disruption, repairs, and reconstruction of coal gasification operations in 2017 were recognized in "Cost of sales" and insurance net of costs in 2018 was recognized in "Cost of sales" and "Other (income) charges, net" in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Comprehensive Income and Retained Earnings.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In December 2019, management approved a plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site by the end of 2020 resulting in an asset impairment charge of $27 million. Eastman is evaluating alternative uses for the site after the end of 2020. Additional restructuring charges of up to $50 million are expected in 2020. This action is projected to result in an estimated annual earnings benefit of approximately $25 million within the AFP and CI segments beginning mostly in 2021.

As a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill the Company reduced the carrying value of the crop protection reporting unit (part of the AFP segment) to its estimated fair value through recognition of a $45 million goodwill impairment. The impairment was primarily due to the recent and expected continuing impact of recent regulatory changes in the European Union and a decrease in the long-term growth rate assumed for the reporting unit in the goodwill impairment model.

In 2019, as part of business improvement and cost reduction initiatives, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $45 million for severance and $5 million for related costs. Management anticipated total cost savings from these actions of approximately $50 million, most of which was recognized in 2019 primarily in cost of sales and SG&A expenses. Additionally, in 2019 the Company recognized a $4 million restructuring charge related to a capital project in the AFP segment that was discontinued in 2016.

In 2018, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net consisted of restructuring charges of approximately $6 million for severance. As a result of the annual impairment test of goodwill the Company reduced the carrying value of the crop protection reporting unit (part of the AFP segment) to its estimated fair value through recognition of a $38 million goodwill impairment. The impairment was primarily due to an increase in the WACC applied to the impairment analysis and the estimated impact of future regulatory changes. Additionally, the Company recognized an intangible asset impairment of $1 million in the AM segment.

In 2017, asset impairments and restructuring charges, net were $3 million of asset impairments and restructuring charges, including severance, in the AFP segment related to the closure of a facility in China and restructuring charges of approximately $5 million for severance.

Net Interest Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared to 2018

Net interest expense decreased $17 million primarily as a result of U.S. dollar to euro cross-currency swaps, reduced debt balances, and lower interest rates.

2018 Compared to 2017

Net interest expense decreased $6 million primarily as a result of U.S. dollar to euro cross-currency swaps and reduced debt partly offset by increased interest rates.

Early Debt Extinguishment and Other Related Costs

In fourth quarter 2018, the Company sold 3.5% notes due December 2021 in the principal amount of $300 million and 4.5% notes due December 2028 in the principal amount of $500 million. Net proceeds from the notes were $789 million and were used, together with available cash, for the early and full repayment of the 5.5% notes due November 2019 ($250 million principal) and the partial redemption of the 2.7% notes due January 2020 ($550 million principal). Total consideration for these prepayments were $806 million ($800 million total principal and $6 million for the early redemption premiums) and are reported as financing activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The early repayment resulted in a charge of $7 million for early debt extinguishment costs which was primarily attributable to the early redemption premiums and related unamortized costs. The book value of the redeemed debt was $799 million. 

For additional information regarding the early debt extinguishment costs, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes

(1) Provision for income taxes for non-core and unusual items is calculated using the tax rate for the jurisdiction where the gains are taxable and the expenses are deductible.

43

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The 2019 effective tax rate includes a $7 million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act and from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations. The 2019 effective tax rate also includes adjustments to the tax provision to reflect finalization of prior year's income tax returns and an increase to state income taxes related to additional valuation allowance provided against state income tax credits.

The 2018 effective tax rate included a $20 million increase to the provision for income taxes resulting from adjustments to the net tax benefit recognized in fourth quarter 2017 resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations. These adjustments related to the one-time transition tax on deferred foreign income and changes in valuation of deferred tax assets associated with tax law changes and outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center.

The 2017 effective tax rate included a $339 million net benefit resulting from tax law changes, primarily the Tax Reform Act, and a tax loss from outside-U.S. entity reorganizations as part of the formation of an international treasury services center, a $20 million benefit due to amendments to prior years' domestic income tax returns, and a $30 million benefit reflecting the finalization of prior years' foreign income tax returns. The 2017 effective tax rate also includes an $8 million tax benefit due to a tax ruling permitting deductibility of a liquidation loss on a previously impaired site.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SUMMARY BY OPERATING SEGMENT

Eastman's products and operations are managed and reported in four operating segments: Additives & Functional Products ("AFP"), Advanced Materials ("AM"), Chemical Intermediates ("CI"), and Fibers. For additional financial and product information for each operating segment, see "Business - Business Segments" in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report and Note 19, "Segment and Regional Sales Information", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared to 2018

Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower sales volume, lower selling prices, and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The lower sales volume was primarily attributed to weaker end-market demand resulting from global trade-related pressures, particularly in transportation markets and other consumer discretionary end markets. Lower selling prices were primarily due to lower raw material prices, including for care chemicals, and increased competitive pressure in markets for tire additives, animal nutrition, and adhesives resins.

EBIT in 2019 included a $45 million goodwill impairment of the crop protection business, an asset impairment charge of $5 million resulting from management's approval of a plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site by the end of 2020, and a $4 million restructuring charge related to a capital project. EBIT in 2018 included a goodwill impairment charge related to the crop protection business and coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices of $133 million, lower sales volume of $101 million, and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates of $22 million, partially offset by lower raw material costs of $136 million.

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased due to higher sales volume, higher selling prices across most product lines, and a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. The higher sales volume was primarily attributed to volume growth in care chemicals, coatings and inks additives, tire additives, and animal nutrition, and products previously reported in the CI segment.

45

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

EBIT in 2018 included a goodwill impairment charge related to the crop protection business and coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs. EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident, asset impairment and restructuring charges, including severance, related to the closure of a facility in China, and a gain from sale of the formulated electronics cleaning solutions business. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume of $54 million largely offset by higher raw material, energy, and distribution costs more than exceeding higher selling prices by $20 million, primarily due to fourth quarter competitive pressure in adhesives resins, and higher growth initiative costs of approximately $20 million.

Growth Initiatives

In 2019, the AFP segment:

•advanced growth and innovation of Regalite™ UltraPure hydrocarbon resin, a new class of clean tackifying hydrocarbon resins, through a capacity expansion at the Middelburg, Netherlands manufacturing site; 

•acquired the Marlotherm™ heat transfer assets in Marl, Germany and the related formulations, intellectual property, and customer contracts, as a targeted addition to the specialty fluids business;

•advanced growth of Impera™ resins through capacity expansions for the production of performance resins for tires at both the Middelburg, Netherlands, and Jefferson, Pennsylvania, manufacturing sites to serve demand from tire manufacturers around the world for product solutions that enable improved safety, efficiency, and performance;

•continued to enhance our ability to serve the global customer base in low volatile organic compound ("VOC") coatings and other markets by completing the final phase of a ketones capacity expansion at the Kingsport, Tennessee manufacturing site in fourth quarter 2019; and 

•responded to growing demand for purified water and sustainable waste water treatment across the globe with world scale production units for Dimethylaminoethanol ("DMAE"/"DMEA") in Europe (Belgium) and North America (Louisiana) and decided to expand capacity in China to respond to stricter regulation and rapidly growing demand in Asia (DMAE is used as a key component into flocculants that are critical for municipal and industrial water treatments).

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

2019 Compared to 2018

Sales revenue decreased due to lower sales volume and an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates. Increased sales volume of premium products, including paint protection film, Tritan™ copolyester, and Saflex™ acoustic and architectural interlayers, was more than offset by decreased sales volume of standard copolyester and interlayers products related to underlying market declines in transportation and consumer durable end markets.

EBIT in 2019 included a restructuring charge for severance costs. EBIT in 2018 included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs and a charge for an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to lower raw material costs of $49 million, mostly offset by an unfavorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates of $23 million and lower sales volume of $16 million. The impact of lower sales volume was mostly offset by increased sales of certain premium products.

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix across the segment, including for premium products such as performance films, Saflex™ head-up displays, and Tritan™ copolyester. While 2018 had higher sales volume compared with 2017, fourth quarter 2018 had lower specialty plastics sales volume compared to fourth quarter 2017 attributed to customer inventory destocking related to uncertainty caused by the U.S. - China trade dispute.

EBIT in 2018 included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs and a charge for an impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. EBIT in 2017 included net costs resulting from the coal gasification incident. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT increased primarily due to higher sales volume and improved product mix of premium products of $94 million, partially offset by higher raw material (particularly for paraxylene in the second half of the year), energy, and distribution costs of $67 million and higher growth initiative costs of approximately $25 million.

Growth Initiatives

In 2019, the AM segment:

•continued the growth of Tritan™ copolyester in the durable goods and health and wellness markets, supported by continued market and application development;

•strengthened growth in automotive paint protection films in North America and China through an improved sales channel, marketing, and commercial execution strategies and capabilities; 

•finalized development and announced the launch of Eastman CORE (trademark and patent pending) next generation analytics-based software platform for automotive window and paint protection film products, enabling more efficient application and overall business management for dealers; and

•developed and enhanced Eastman's sustainability capabilities and commercial opportunities, including strategic collaborations with third parties to secure a consistent source of recyclable copolyester feedstock and to innovate new sustainable specialty plastic solutions.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared to 2018

Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower selling prices across the segment attributed to lower raw material prices and increased competitive activity. Sales revenue was also negatively impacted by lower functional amines products sales volume attributed to weaker demand in agricultural end-markets resulting from wet weather in North America and lower intermediates products sales volume attributed to increased competitive activity.

EBIT in 2019 included an asset impairment charge resulting from management's approval of a plan to discontinue production of certain products at the Singapore manufacturing site by the end of 2020. EBIT in 2018 included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs. Excluding these non-core and unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices more than offsetting lower raw material costs of $63 million and lower sales volumes of $9 million.

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased due to higher selling prices across most product lines, particularly for acetyl derivatives attributed to favorable market conditions and for olefin derivatives due to higher raw material and energy costs. Higher selling prices were partially offset by lower sales volume primarily attributable to lower merchant ethylene sales, products previously reported in the CI segment being reported in the AFP segment in 2018, and supplier operational disruptions at the Texas City and Longview, Texas manufacturing facilities. Lower merchant ethylene sales are primarily due to the decision to reduce operating rates of the olefins cracking units at the Longview, Texas manufacturing facility due to spot ethylene prices. Lower sales volume was partially offset by higher functional amines products sales attributed to strengthened agriculture and energy markets.

EBIT included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018 and coal gasification incident net costs in 2017. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT decreased due to lower sales volume of $62 million, and higher planned manufacturing shutdown costs of $21 million. The decrease was partially offset by higher selling prices exceeding higher raw material, energy, and distribution costs of $61 million.

48

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cost and Growth Initiatives

To maintain and enhance its status as a low-cost producer and optimize earnings, the CI segment continuously focuses on cost control, operational efficiency, and capacity utilization. This includes focusing on products used internally by other operating segments, thereby supporting growth in specialty product lines throughout the Company, and also external licensing opportunities.

In 2018, the Company completed modifications to the olefin cracking units at the Longview, Texas manufacturing site. These modifications allowed for the introduction of refinery-grade propylene ("RGP") into the feedstock mix while also reducing the amount of other purchased feedstocks. This feedstock shift resulted in a significant decrease in ethylene production and excess ethylene sales in 2019, while maintaining historical levels of propylene production. The RGP project provided the flexibility to significantly reduce the Company's participation in the merchant ethylene market, while retaining a cost-advantaged integrated propylene position to support specialty derivatives throughout the Company. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared to 2018

Sales revenue decreased primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume attributed to weakened market demand resulting from general market decline and customer buying patterns.

EBIT included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018. Excluding this unusual item, EBIT decreased primarily due to lower acetate tow sales volume of $24 million.

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue increased primarily due to sales of nonwovens products previously reported in "Other" of $57 million and higher sales volume, particularly for textiles products. The higher sales revenue was partially offset by lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow. Lower acetate tow selling prices were primarily attributed to lower industry capacity utilization.

EBIT included coal gasification incident insurance in excess of costs in 2018 and coal gasification incident net costs in 2017. Excluding these unusual items, EBIT decreased primarily due to the net impact of $7 million of lower selling prices, particularly for acetate tow attributed to lower capacity utilization, and higher raw material and energy costs, partially offset by volume growth of textiles products.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Cost and Growth Initiatives

In 2019 the Company acquired Industrias del Acetato de Celulosa. S.A. ("INACSA"), a cellulosic yarn business in LA Batllòria, Spain as a targeted addition to the Fibers segment's acetate yarn business. 

The Fibers segment R&D efforts focus on serving existing customers, leveraging proprietary cellulose ester and spinning technology for differentiated application development in new markets, optimizing asset productivity, and working with suppliers to reduce costs. For acetate tow, these efforts are assisting customers in the effective use of the segment's products and customers' product development efforts. Beyond acetate tow, management is applying the innovation-driven growth model to leverage its fibers technology and expertise to focus on innovative growth in the textiles and nonwovens markets. Examples of recent product innovation within the Fibers segment include Naia™ yarn for the apparel market developed from Eastman's proprietary cellulose ester technology; Avra™ performance fibers for the apparel, home furnishings and industrial fabrics markets developed from a combination of Eastman proprietary spinning technology and polymer chemistry enabling unique fiber capabilities of size, shape, comfort, and performance; and Vestera™ wood pulp-based alternative for the nonwoven industry used in personal hygiene applications.

2019 Compared to 2018

Sales revenue in United States and Canada decreased primarily due to lower selling prices and lower sales volume in all operating segments, particularly in the CI and AFP segments. 

Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa decreased primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates in all operating segments, lower AFP segment selling prices, and lower AFP and CI segments sales volume. These items were partially offset by higher sales volume in the AM segment.

Sales revenue in Asia Pacific decreased primarily due to lower sales volume in all operating segments, particularly in the AFP and AM segments, and lower CI and AFP segments selling prices.

Sales revenue in Latin America decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, particularly in the CI segment.

2018 Compared to 2017

Sales revenue in United States and Canada increased primarily due to higher CI, AFP, and AM segments selling prices and higher AFP and AM segments sales volume. The increase was partially offset by lower CI segment sales volume, primarily resulting from lower merchant ethylene sales. 

Sales revenue in Europe, Middle East, and Africa increased primarily due to a favorable shift in foreign currency exchange rates across the segments, higher CI, AM, and Fibers segments sales volume, and higher AFP and CI segments selling prices. These items were partially offset by lower AFP segment sales volume.

Sales revenue in Asia Pacific increased primarily due to higher AFP and AM segments sales volume and higher CI and AFP segments selling prices partially offset by lower Fibers segment selling prices.

Sales revenue in Latin America increased primarily due to higher AM, AFP, and CI segments sales volume and higher CI segment selling prices.

Cash Flows

The Company had cash and cash equivalents as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, and other sources of liquidity are expected to be available and sufficient to meet foreseeable cash requirements. However, the Company's cash flows from operations can be affected by numerous factors including risks associated with global operations, raw material availability and cost, demand for and pricing of Eastman's products, capacity utilization, and other factors described under "Risk Factors" in this MD&A. Management believes maintaining a financial profile that supports an investment grade credit rating is important to its long-term strategy and financial flexibility.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared to 2018

Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to lower net earnings, partially offset by lower net working capital (trade receivables, inventories, and trade payables).

Cash used in investing activities increased $17 million. Twelve months 2018 included $65 million proceeds from coal gasification incident insurance for property damage. Excluding this item, cash used in investing activities decreased $48 million due to lower capital expenditures partially offset by acquisitions of businesses in the AFP and Fibers segments. Lower capital expenditures were due to significant capital projects related to key growth initiatives being completed and put into service during 2018.

Cash used in financing activities was relatively unchanged with increased net debt repayments and dividend payments offset by lower share repurchases.

2018 Compared to 2017

Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to increased inventory resulting from reduced demand and higher cost raw materials inventory in fourth quarter 2018.

Cash used in investing activities decreased primarily due to decreased capital expenditures as significant capital projects related to key growth initiatives were completed and put into service during 2018. See "Capital Expenditures" below.

Cash used in financing activities increased primarily due to increased share repurchases and dividend payments partially offset by reduced net debt repayments.

Working Capital Management and Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Eastman applies a proactive and disciplined approach to working capital management to optimize cash flow and to enable a full range of capital allocation options in support of the Company's strategy. Eastman expects to continue utilizing the programs described below to support free cash flow consistent with our past practices.

Eastman works with suppliers to optimize payment terms and conditions on accounts payable to enhance timing of working capital and cash flows. As part of these efforts, in 2019, the Company introduced a voluntary supply chain finance program to provide suppliers with the opportunity to sell receivables due from Eastman to a participating financial institution. A downgrade in Eastman's credit rating or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institution's willingness to commit funds to, and participate in, the program. Management does not believe such risk would have a material impact on the Company's working capital or cash flows. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding the program.

In 2019, the Company expanded off balance sheet, uncommitted accounts receivable factoring agreements under which entire invoices may be sold, without recourse, to third-party financial institutions. Available capacity under these agreements, which the Company uses as a source of working capital funding, is dependent on the level of accounts receivable eligible to be sold and the financial institutions' willingness to purchase such receivables. The total amount of receivables sold in 2019 and 2018 were $857 million and $219 million, respectively. Based on the original terms of receivables sold for certain agreements and actual outstanding balance of receivables under service agreements, the Company estimates that $169 million and $76 million of these receivables would have been outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, had they not been sold under these factoring agreements.

Revolving Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Borrowings

The Company has access to a $1.50 billion revolving credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") expiring October 2023. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are subject to interest at varying spreads above quoted market rates and a commitment fee is paid on the total unused commitment. The Credit Facility provides available liquidity for general corporate purposes and supports commercial paper borrowings. Commercial paper borrowings are classified as short-term. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2019, commercial paper borrowings were $170 million with a weighted average interest rate of 2.03 percent. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

The Company has access to up to $250 million under an accounts receivable securitization agreement (the "A/R Facility") that expires April 2020. Eastman Chemical Financial Corporation ("ECFC"), a subsidiary of the Company, has an agreement to sell interests in trade receivables under the A/R Facility to a third party purchaser. Third party creditors of ECFC have first priority claims on the assets of ECFC before those assets would be available to satisfy the Company's general obligations. Borrowings under the A/R Facility are subject to interest rates based on a spread over the lender's borrowing costs, and ECFC pays a fee to maintain availability of the A/R Facility. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no borrowings under the A/R Facility. See Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

53

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Credit Facility and A/R Facility contain customary covenants, including requirements to maintain certain financial ratios, that determine the events of default, amounts available, and terms of borrowings. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at both December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. The amount of available borrowings under the A/R and Credit Facilities was approximately $1.75 billion as of December 31, 2019. For additional information, see Section 5.03 of the Credit Facility at Exhibit 10.01 to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2018.

Debt and Other Commitments

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2019, Eastman's borrowings totaled approximately $5.8 billion with various maturities. In fourth quarter 2019, the Company repaid the 2.7% notes due January 2020 ($250 million principal) using available cash. In fourth quarter 2018 the Company refinanced certain outstanding public debt with proceeds of the sale of new debt securities, which extended the weighted average maturity of outstanding debt while retaining adequate levels of pre-payable debt and near-term maturities. 

Estimated future payments of debt securities assumes the repayment of principal upon stated maturity, and actual amounts and the timing of such payments may differ materially due to repayment or other changes in the terms of such debt prior to maturity. For information on debt securities, credit facilities and other, and interest payable, see Note 8, "Borrowings", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

For information about purchase obligations and operating leases, see Note 11, "Leases and Other Commitments", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 

Amounts in other liabilities represent the current estimated cash payments required to be made by the Company primarily for pension and other postretirement benefits, environmental loss contingency reserves, accrued compensation benefits, uncertain tax liabilities, and commodity and foreign exchange hedging in the periods indicated. Due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with respect to taxing authorities, management is unable to determine the timing of payments related to uncertain tax liabilities and these amounts are included in the "2025 and beyond" line item.

The amount and timing of pension and other postretirement benefit payments included in other liabilities is dependent upon interest rates, health care cost trends, actual returns on plan assets, retirement and attrition rates of employees, continuation or modification of the benefit plans, and other factors. Such factors can significantly impact the amount and timing of any future contributions by the Company. Excess contributions are periodically made by management in order to keep the plans' funded status above 80 percent under the funding provisions of the Pension Protection Act to avoid partial benefit restrictions on accelerated forms of payment. The Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans are not currently under any benefit restrictions. See Note 10, "Retirement Plans", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, for more information regarding pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The resolution of uncertainties related to environmental matters included in other liabilities may have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations in the period recognized, however, because of the availability of legal defenses, the Company's preliminary assessment of actions that may be required, and, if applicable, the expected sharing of costs, management does not believe that the Company's liability for these environmental matters, individually or in the aggregate, will be material to the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for the Company's accounting policy for environmental costs, and see Note 12, "Environmental Matters and Asset Retirement Obligations", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding outstanding environmental matters and asset retirement obligations.

Capital Expenditures

Capital expenditures were $425 million, $528 million ($463 million net of proceeds from property damage insurance for 2017 coal gasification incident), and $649 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2019 were primarily for targeted growth initiatives and site modernization projects at the Longview, Texas; Kingsport, Tennessee; and Jefferson, Pennsylvania manufacturing sites.

The Company expects that 2020 capital spending will be between $450 million and $475 million, primarily for targeted growth initiatives and site modernization projects.

The Company had capital expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement of approximately $27 million, $44 million, and $38 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. The Company does not currently expect near term environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially impact the Company's planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

Stock Repurchases and Dividends

In February 2014, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company completed the $1 billion repurchase authorization in May 2018, acquiring a total of 12,215,950 shares. In February 2018, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock at such times, in such amounts, and on such terms, as determined by management to be in the best interest of the Company. As of December 31, 2019, a total of 6,753,164 shares have been repurchased under the February 2018 authorization for a total amount of $573 million. During 2019, the Company repurchased a total of 4,282,409 shares for a total cost of approximately $325 million.

The Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.66 per share during the first quarter of 2020, payable on April 3, 2020 to stockholders of record on March 16, 2020.

INFLATION

In recent years, general economic inflation has not had a material adverse impact on Eastman's costs. The cost of raw materials is generally based on market prices, although derivative financial instruments are utilized, as appropriate, to mitigate short-term market price fluctuations. Management expects the volatility of raw material and energy prices and costs to continue and the Company will continue to pursue pricing and hedging strategies and ongoing cost control initiatives to offset the effects. For additional information, see Note 9, "Derivative and Non-Derivative Financial Instruments", to the Company's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

For information regarding the impact of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1, "Significant Accounting Policies", to Eastman's consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OUTLOOK

In 2020, management expects adjusted EPS to be between $7.20 to $7.60 and free cash flow to be between $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion. These expectations assume:

•earnings to benefit from higher sales volume due to increased new business revenue, less market and customer inventory destocking, and stable growth in some end-markets, actions to reduce operating costs by $20 million to $40 million, and lower pension and depreciation costs;

•earnings to be negatively impacted by lower product margins in the CI segment and adhesive resins, tire additives, and animal nutrition products in the AFP segment, higher variable compensation costs, and a stronger U.S. dollar;

•interest expense of approximately $215 million;

•the full-year effective tax rate on reported earnings before income tax to be similar to 2019;

•depreciation and amortization of approximately $560 million;

•capital expenditures between $450 million and $475 million;

•debt reduction greater than $400 million; and

•continued share repurchases.

The Company's 2020 financial results forecasts do not include non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items. Accordingly, management is unable to reconcile projected full-year 2020 earnings excluding non-core, unusual, or non-recurring items to projected reported GAAP earnings without unreasonable efforts. These forecasts also do not include the possible impact on business and financial results of the recent coronavirus outbreak, including negative impact on overall business and market conditions; Eastman manufacturing sites and distribution, sales, and service facilities closure or reduced availability, including for employee health and safety; and Eastman products market demand weakness and supply chain disruption.

See "Risk Factors" below.

RISK FACTORS 

In addition to factors described elsewhere in this Annual Report, the following are the most significant known factors, risks, and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time. See "Forward-Looking Statements".

Continued uncertain conditions in the global economy and the financial markets could negatively impact the Company.

The Company's business and operating results were affected by the impact of the last global recession, and its related impacts, such as the credit market crisis, declining consumer and business confidence, fluctuating commodity prices, volatile exchange rates, and other challenges that affected the global economy. Continued uncertainty in the global economy and global capital markets may adversely affect Eastman's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. In addition, the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets under attractive rates and terms could be constrained, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives.

Volatility in costs for strategic raw material and energy commodities or disruption in the supply of these commodities could adversely affect the Company's financial results.

Eastman is reliant on certain strategic raw material and energy commodities for its operations and utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as appropriate, to mitigate market fluctuations in raw material and energy costs. These risk mitigation measures do not eliminate all exposure to market fluctuations and may limit the Company from fully benefiting from lower raw material costs and, conversely, offset the impact of higher raw material costs. In addition, natural disasters, pandemic illness (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), plant interruptions, changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, and breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of strategic raw material and energy commodities, could adversely impact both the cost and availability of these commodities.

Loss or financial weakness of any of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial results.

Although Eastman has an extensive customer base, loss of, or material financial weakness of, certain of the Company's largest customers could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced. No assurances can be made that the Company would be able to regain or replace any lost customers.

56

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing businesses, including cyber security risks, any of which could disrupt manufacturing operations or related infrastructure and adversely affect results of operations.

As a global specialty chemicals manufacturing company, Eastman's business is subject to operating risks common to chemical manufacturing, storage, handling, and transportation, including explosions, fires, inclement weather, natural disasters, mechanical failure, unscheduled downtime, transportation interruptions, remediation, chemical spills, discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases. Significant limitation on the Company's ability to manufacture products due to disruption of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on the Company's sales revenue, costs, results of operations, credit ratings, and financial condition. Disruptions could occur due to internal factors such as computer or equipment malfunction (accidental or intentional), operator error, or process failures; or external factors such as computer or equipment malfunction at third-party service providers, natural disasters, pandemic illness (including the recent coronavirus outbreak), changes in laws or regulations, war or other outbreak of hostilities or terrorism, cyber attacks, or breakdown or degradation of transportation infrastructure used for delivery of supplies to the Company or for delivery of products to customers. The Company has in the past experienced cyber attacks and breaches of its computer information systems, although none of these have had a material adverse effect on the Company's operations. While the Company remains committed to managing cyber related risk, no assurances can be provided that any future disruptions due to these, or other, circumstances will not have a material effect on operations. Unplanned disruptions of manufacturing operations or related infrastructure could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors, and the environment, and could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations. As previously reported, manufacturing operations and earnings have been negatively impacted by the fourth quarter 2017 operational incident in the Kingsport manufacturing facility coal gasification operations area and the second quarter 2018 third-party supplier operational disruptions at the Texas City and Longview, Texas manufacturing facilities.

Growth initiatives may not achieve desired business or financial objectives and may require significant resources in addition to or different from those available or in excess of those estimated or budgeted for such initiatives.

Eastman continues to identify and pursue growth opportunities through both organic and inorganic initiatives. These growth opportunities include development and commercialization or licensing of innovative new products and technologies and related employee leadership, expertise, skill development and retention, expansion into new markets and geographic regions, alliances, ventures, and acquisitions that complement and extend the Company's portfolio of businesses and capabilities. Such initiatives are necessarily constrained by available and development of additional resources, including development, attraction, and retention of employee leadership, application development, and sales and marketing talent and capabilities. There can be no assurance that such innovation, development and commercialization or licensing efforts, investments, or acquisitions and alliances (including integration of acquired businesses) will result in financially successful commercialization of products, or acceptance by existing or new customers, or successful entry into new markets or otherwise achieve their underlying strategic business objectives or that they will be beneficial to the Company's results of operations. There also can be no assurance that capital projects for growth efforts can be completed within the time or at the costs projected due, among other things, to demand for and availability of construction materials and labor and obtaining regulatory approvals and operating permits and reaching agreement on terms of key agreements and arrangements with potential suppliers and customers. Any such delays or cost overruns or the inability to obtain such approvals or to reach such agreements on acceptable terms could negatively affect the returns from any proposed or current investments and projects.

57

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The Company's substantial global operations subject it to risks of doing business in other countries, including U.S. and non-U.S. trade relations, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations.

More than half of Eastman's sales for 2019 were to customers outside of North America. The Company expects sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of its sales. Also, a significant portion of the Company's manufacturing capacity is located outside of the United States. Accordingly, the Company's business is subject to risks related to the differing legal, political, cultural, social and regulatory requirements, and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in U.S. dollars of products and services provided in foreign countries. In addition, the U.S. or foreign countries have imposed and may impose additional taxes or otherwise tax Eastman's foreign income, or adopt or increase restrictions on foreign trade or investment, including currency exchange controls, tariffs or other taxes, or limitations on imports or exports (including recent and proposed changes in U.S. trade policy and resulting retaliatory actions by other countries, including China, which have recently reduced and which may increasingly reduce demand for and increase costs of impacted products or result in U.S.-based trade counterparties limiting trade with U.S.-based companies or non-U.S. customers limiting their purchases from U.S.-based companies). Certain legal and political risks are also inherent in the operation of a company with Eastman's global scope. For example, it may be more difficult for Eastman to enforce its agreements or collect receivables through foreign legal systems, and the laws of some countries may not protect the Company's intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Failure of foreign countries to have laws to protect Eastman's intellectual property rights or an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign countries could result in loss of valuable proprietary information. There is also risk that foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises in certain countries where Eastman operates. Social and cultural norms in certain countries may not support compliance with Eastman's corporate policies including those that require compliance with substantive laws and regulations. Also, changes in general economic and political conditions (including the U.K. departure from the European Union, also known as "Brexit") in countries where Eastman operates are a risk to the Company's financial performance. As Eastman continues to operate its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to its multinational operations will not have an adverse effect on Eastman's business, financial condition, or results of operations.

Legislative, regulatory, or voluntary actions could increase the Company's future health, safety, and environmental compliance costs.

Eastman and its facilities and businesses are subject to complex health, safety, and environmental laws, regulations and related voluntary actions, both in the U.S. and internationally, which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws, regulations, and voluntary actions. The Company's accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based. For example, any amount accrued for environmental matters reflects the Company's assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number of and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations and actions, and testing requirements could result in higher costs. Specifically, future changes in legislation and regulation and related voluntary actions associated with physical impacts of climate change may increase the likelihood that the Company's manufacturing facilities will in the future be impacted by carbon requirements, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and energy policy, and may result in capital expenditures, increases in costs for raw materials and energy, limitations on raw material and energy source and supply choices, and other direct compliance costs.

58

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Significant acquisitions expose the Company to risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.

While acquisitions have been and continue to be a part of Eastman's growth strategy, acquisitions of large companies and businesses (such as the previous acquisitions of Taminco Corporation and Solutia, Inc.) subject the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could have a material adverse effect on Eastman. These include, but are not limited to, the possibilities that the actual and projected future financial performance of the acquired business may be significantly worse than expected and that, as reported in "Critical Accounting Estimates - Impairment of Long-Lived Assets - Goodwill" in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report, the carrying values of certain assets from acquisitions may be impaired resulting in charges to future earnings; that significant additional indebtedness may constrain the Company's ability to access the credit and capital markets at attractive interest rates and favorable terms, which may negatively impact the Company's liquidity or ability to pursue certain growth initiatives; that the Company may not be able to achieve the cost, revenue, tax, or other "synergies" expected from any acquisition, or that there may be delays in achieving any such synergies; that management's time and effort may be dedicated to the new business resulting in a loss of focus on the successful operation of the Company's existing businesses; and that the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to integrate any acquired business into Eastman or that the integration efforts will not achieve the expected benefits.

In addition to the foregoing most significant known risk factors to the Company, there may be other factors, not currently known to the Company, which could, in the future, materially adversely affect the Company, its business, financial condition, or results of operations. The foregoing discussion of the most significant risk factors to the Company does not necessarily present them in order of importance. This disclosure, including that under "Outlook" and other forward-looking statements and related disclosures made by the Company in this Annual Report and elsewhere from time to time, represents management's best judgment as of the date the information is given. The Company does not undertake responsibility for updating any of such information, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Investors are advised, however, to consult any further public Company disclosures (such as in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission or in Company press releases) on related subjects.
