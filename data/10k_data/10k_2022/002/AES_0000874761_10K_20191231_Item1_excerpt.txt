Our mission is to improve lives by accelerating a safer and greener energy future. We do this by leveraging our unique electricity 

5 | 2019 Annual Report

platforms and the knowledge of our people to provide the energy and infrastructure solutions our customers need. Our people share a passion to help meet the world's current and increasing energy needs, while providing communities and countries the opportunity for economic growth through the availability of reliable, affordable electric power.

Our Strategy 

AES is leading the energy transition by investing in sustainable growth and innovative solutions to deliver superior results. We are taking advantage of favorable trends in clean power generation, transmission and distribution, and LNG infrastructure.

Through our presence in key growth markets, we are well-positioned to benefit from the global transition toward a more sustainable power generation mix. Our robust backlog of projects under construction or under signed PPAs continues to increase, driven by our focus on select markets where we can take advantage of our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses. In 2019, we signed long-term PPAs for 2.8 GW, representing 9% of our existing capacity, and we are on pace to sign 2 to 3 GW of new PPAs annually through 2022. 

We are enhancing some of our current contracts by extending existing PPAs and adding renewable energy. We call this approach Green Blend and Extend. With this strategy, we leverage our existing platforms, contracts and relationships to grow our business, while meeting our customers' energy needs on a reliable and sustainable basis. We are negotiating new long-term renewable PPAs with existing customers, which preserves the value of thermal contracts and creates incremental value with long-term contracted renewables. Customers receive carbon-free energy at less than the marginal cost of thermal power, enabling them to meet their sustainability goals and affordable energy needs. We are executing on this strategy in Chile and Mexico and see significant potential additional opportunities in those markets, as well as in the United States. 

We are facilitating access to reliable and affordable cleaner energy through our LNG import terminals, allowing the displacement of the use of heavy fuel oil and diesel. We have two LNG regasification terminals in Central America and the Caribbean, with a total of 150 TBTU of LNG storage capacity. These terminals were built to supply not only the gas for our co-located combined cycle plants, but also to meet the growing demand for natural gas in the region. In order to meet this demand, we are expanding our capacity in the Dominican Republic by adding a second storage tank with 50 TBTU of additional capacity and we recently completed construction of a pipeline that will transport natural gas from our LNG terminal to several power plants in the country.

6 | 2019 Annual Report

We are replicating our success with LNG infrastructure in the Dominican Republic and Panama by developing a similar project, on a larger scale, in Vietnam. This project will have 480 TBTU of LNG storage capacity co-located with 2.2 GW of combined cycle plants. The project will have substantial excess LNG capacity to help meet demand for natural gas in Vietnam and the power plants will have 20-year contracts with the Government of Vietnam.

At our utilities, we are accelerating growth through grid modernization and infrastructure investments to replace outdated networks. During the year, Indianapolis Power & Light filed a $1.2 billion seven-year plan with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. We see similar growth opportunities at Dayton Power & Light in Ohio.

We are developing and deploying innovative solutions such as battery-based energy storage, digital customer interfaces and energy management. These solutions are scalable and capital light, allowing us to work with our customers to deliver results that meet their requirements.

As a result of executing on our strategy, we are targeting a 50% reduction in carbon intensity by 2022 and a 70% reduction by 2030, both off a 2016 base. Further, we intend to reduce our coal-fired generation below 30% of our total generation volume by year-end 2020 and below 10% by 2030 (based on the expected portfolio as of year-end, adjusted for any announced asset sales at that time).

Overview 

Generation

We currently own and/or operate a generation portfolio of 30,471 MW, including generation from our one integrated utility, IPL. Our generation fleet is diversified by fuel type. See discussion below under Fuel Costs.

Performance drivers of our generation businesses include types of electricity sales agreements, plant reliability and flexibility, availability of generation capacity to meet contracted sales, fuel costs, seasonality, weather variations and economic activity, fixed-cost management, and competition.

7 | 2019 Annual Report

Contract Sales — Most of our generation businesses sell electricity under medium- or long-term contracts ("contract sales") or under short-term agreements in competitive markets ("short-term sales"). Our medium-term contract sales have terms of two to five years, while our long-term contracts have terms of more than five years. 

Contracts requiring fuel to generate energy, such as natural gas or coal, are structured to recover variable costs, including fuel and variable O&M costs, either through direct or indexation-based contractual pass-throughs or tolling arrangements. When the contract does not include a fuel pass-through, we typically hedge fuel costs or enter into fuel supply agreements for a similar contract period (see discussion below under Fuel Costs). These contracts also help us to fund a significant portion of the total capital cost of the project through long-term non-recourse project-level financing.

Certain contracts include capacity payments that cover projected fixed costs of the plant, including fixed O&M expenses, debt service, and a return on capital invested. In addition, most of our contracts require that the majority of the capacity payments be denominated in the currency matching our fixed costs. 

Contracts that do not have significant fuel cost or do not contain a capacity payment are structured based on long-term spot prices with some negotiated pass-through costs, allowing us to recover expected fixed and variable costs as well as provide a return on investment. 

These contracts are intended to reduce exposure to the volatility of fuel and electricity prices by linking the business's revenues and costs. We generally structure our business to eliminate or reduce foreign exchange risk by matching the currency of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs and debt. Our project debt may consist of both fixed and floating rate debt for which we typically hedge a significant portion of our exposure. Some of our contracted businesses also receive a regulated market-based capacity payment, which is discussed in more detail in the Short-Term Sales section below.

Thus, these contracts, or other related commercial arrangements, significantly mitigate our exposure to changes in power and, as applicable, fuel prices, currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates. In addition, these contracts generally provide for a recovery of our fixed operating expenses and a return on our investment, as long as we operate the plant to the reliability and efficiency standards required in the contract.

Short-Term Sales — Our other generation businesses sell power and ancillary services under short-term contracts with average terms of less than two years, including spot sales, directly in the short-term market or at regulated prices. The short-term markets are typically administered by a system operator to coordinate dispatch. Short-term markets generally operate on merit order dispatch, where the least expensive generation facilities, based upon variable cost or bid price, are dispatched first and the most expensive facilities are dispatched last. The short-term price is typically set at the marginal cost of energy or bid price (the cost of the last plant required to meet system demand). As a result, the cash flows and earnings associated with these businesses are more sensitive to fluctuations in the market price for electricity. In addition, many of these wholesale markets include markets for ancillary services to support the reliable operation of the transmission system. Across our portfolio, we provide a wide array of ancillary services, including voltage support, frequency regulation and spinning reserves. 

Many of the short-term markets in which we operate include regulated capacity markets. These capacity markets are intended to provide additional revenue based upon availability without reliance on the energy margin from the merit order dispatch. Capacity markets are typically priced based on the cost of a new entrant and the system capacity relative to the desired level of reserve margin (generation available in excess of peak demand). Our generating facilities selling in the short-term markets typically receive capacity payments based on their availability in the market. 

Plant Reliability and Flexibility — Our contract and short-term sales provide incentives to our generation plants to optimally manage availability, operating efficiency and flexibility. Capacity payments under contract sales are frequently tied to meeting minimum standards. In short-term sales, our plants must be reliable and flexible to capture peak market prices and to maximize market-based revenues. In addition, our flexibility allows us to capture ancillary service revenue while meeting local market needs.

Fuel Costs — For our thermal generation plants, fuel is a significant component of our total cost of generation. For contract sales, we often enter into fuel supply agreements to match the contract period, or we may financially hedge our fuel costs. Some of our contracts include indexation for fuels. In those cases, we seek to match our fuel supply agreements to the indexation. For certain projects, we have tolling arrangements where the power offtaker is responsible for the supply and cost of fuel to our plants.

8 | 2019 Annual Report

In short-term sales, we sell power at market prices that are generally reflective of the market cost of fuel at the time, and thus procure fuel supply on a short-term basis, generally designed to match up with our market sales profile. Since fuel price is often the primary determinant for power prices, the economics of projects with short-term sales are often subject to volatility of relative fuel prices. For further information regarding commodity price risk please see Item 7A.—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in this Form 10-K.

31% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by natural gas. Generally, we use gas from local suppliers in each market. A few exceptions to this are AES Gener in Chile, where we purchase imported gas from third parties, and our plants in the Dominican Republic and Panama, where we import LNG to utilize in the local market.

34% of the capacity of our generation fleet is coal-fired. In the U.S., most of our coal-fired plants are supplied from domestic coal. At our non-U.S. generation plants, and at our plants in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, we source coal internationally. Across our fleet, we utilize our global sourcing program to maximize the purchasing power of our fuel procurement.

32% of the capacity of our generation plants are fueled by renewables, including hydro, solar, wind, energy storage, biomass and landfill gas, which do not have significant fuel costs.

3% of the capacity of our generation fleet utilizes pet coke, diesel or oil for fuel. We source oil and diesel locally at prices linked to international markets. We largely source pet coke from Mexico and the U.S. 

Seasonality, Weather Variations and Economic Activity — Our generation businesses are affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations, including temperature, solar and wind resources, and hydrological conditions, may also have an impact on generation output at our renewable generation facilities. In competitive markets for power, local economic activity can also have an impact on power demand and short-term prices for power.

Fixed-Cost Management — In our businesses with long-term contracts, the majority of the fixed O&M costs are recovered through the capacity payment. However, for all generation businesses, managing fixed costs and reducing them over time is a driver of business performance.

Competition — For our businesses with medium- or long-term contracts, there is limited competition during the term of the contract. For short-term sales, plant dispatch and the price of electricity are determined by market competition and local dispatch and reliability rules.

Utilities

AES' six utility businesses distribute power to 2.5 million people in two countries. AES' two utilities in the U.S. also include generation capacity totaling 4,102 MW. Our utility businesses consist of IPL and DP&L in the U.S. and four utilities in El Salvador.

 IPL, our fully integrated utility, and DP&L, our transmission and distribution regulated utility, operate as the sole distributors of electricity within their respective jurisdictions. IPL owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to generate, transmit and distribute electricity. DP&L owns and operates all of the facilities necessary to transmit and distribute electricity. At our distribution business in El Salvador, we face limited competition due to significant barriers to enter the market. According to El Salvador's regulation, large regulated customers have the option of becoming unregulated users and requesting service directly from generation or commercialization agents.

In general, our utilities sell electricity directly to end-users, such as homes and businesses, and bill customers directly. Key performance drivers for utilities include the regulated rate of return and tariff, seasonality, weather variations, economic activity and reliability of service. Revenue from utilities is classified as regulated on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Regulated Rate of Return and Tariff — In exchange for the right to sell or distribute electricity in a service territory, our utility businesses are subject to government regulation. This regulation sets the framework for the prices ("tariffs") that our utilities are allowed to charge customers for electricity and establishes service standards that we are required to meet.

Our utilities are generally permitted to earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator based on the utility's allowed regulatory asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. The asset base on which the utility is permitted a return is determined by the regulator, within the framework of applicable local laws, and is based on the amount of assets that are considered used and useful in serving customers. Both the allowed return 

9 | 2019 Annual Report

and the asset base are important components of the utility's earning power. The allowed rate of return and operating expenses deemed reasonable by the regulator are recovered through the regulated tariff that the utility charges to its customers.

The tariff may be reviewed and reset by the regulator from time to time depending on local regulations, or the utility may seek a change in its tariffs. The tariff is generally based upon usage level and may include a pass-through of costs that are not controlled by the utility, such as the costs of fuel (in the case of integrated utilities) and/or the costs of purchased energy, to the customer. Components of the tariff that are directly passed through to the customer are usually adjusted through a summary regulatory process or an existing formula-based mechanism. In some regulatory regimes, customers with demand above an established level are unregulated and can choose to contract directly with the utility or with other retail energy suppliers and pay non-bypassable fees, which are fees to the distribution company for use of its distribution system.

The regulated tariff generally recognizes that our utility businesses should recover certain operating and fixed costs, as well as manage uncollectible amounts, quality of service and technical and non-technical losses. Utilities, therefore, need to manage costs to the levels reflected in the tariff, or risk non-recovery of costs or diminished returns.

Seasonality, Weather Variations, and Economic Activity — Our utility businesses are generally affected by seasonal weather patterns and, therefore, operating margin is not generated evenly throughout the year. Additionally, weather variations may also have an impact based on the number of customers, temperature variances from normal conditions, and customers' historic usage levels and patterns. Retail sales, after adjustments for weather variations, are also affected by changes in local economic activity, energy efficiency and distributed generation initiatives, as well as the number of retail customers.

Reliability of Service — Our utility businesses must meet certain reliability standards, such as duration and frequency of outages. Those standards may be explicit, with defined performance incentives or penalties, or implicit, where the utility must operate to meet customer and/or regulator expectations.

Development and Construction 

We develop and construct new generation facilities. For our utility business, new plants may be built or existing plants retrofitted in response to customer needs or to comply with regulatory developments. The projects are developed subject to regulatory approval that permits recovery of our capital cost and a return on our investment. For our generation businesses, our priority for development is in key growth markets, where we can leverage our global scale and synergies with our existing businesses by adding renewable energy. We make the decision to invest in new projects by evaluating the strategic fit, project returns and financial profile against a fair risk-adjusted return for the investment and against alternative uses of capital, including corporate debt repayment. 

In some cases, we enter into long-term contracts for output from new facilities prior to commencing construction. To limit required equity contributions from The AES Corporation, we also seek non-recourse project debt financing and other sources of capital, including partners, when it is commercially attractive. We typically contract with a third party to manage construction, although our construction management team supervises the construction work and tracks progress against the project's budget and the required safety, efficiency and productivity standards.

Segments

The segment reporting structure uses the Company's management reporting structure as its foundation to reflect how the Company manages the business internally. It is organized by geographic regions, which provides a socio-political-economic understanding of our business. 

We are organized into four market-oriented SBUs: US and Utilities (United States, Puerto Rico and El Salvador); South America (Chile, Colombia, Argentina and Brazil); MCAC (Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean); and Eurasia (Europe and Asia) — which are led by our SBU Presidents. We have two lines of business: generation and utilities. Each of our SBUs participates in our first business line, generation, in which we own and/or operate power plants to generate and sell power to customers, such as utilities, industrial users, and other intermediaries. Our US and Utilities SBU participates in our second business line, utilities, in which we own and/or operate utilities to generate or purchase, distribute, transmit and sell electricity to end-user customers in the residential, commercial, industrial and governmental sectors within a defined service area. In certain circumstances, our utilities also generate and sell electricity on the wholesale market.

10 | 2019 Annual Report

We measure the operating performance of our SBUs using Adjusted PTC, a non-GAAP measure. The Adjusted PTC by SBU for the year ended December 31, 2019 is shown below. The percentages for Adjusted PTC are the contribution by each SBU to the gross metric, i.e., the total Adjusted PTC by SBU, before deductions for Corporate. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—SBU Performance Analysis of this Form 10-K for reconciliation and definitions of Adjusted PTC.

For financial reporting purposes, the Company's corporate activities and certain other investments are reported within "Corporate and Other" because they do not require separate disclosure. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 18—Segment and Geographic Information included in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further discussion of the Company's segment structure.

US and Utilities Businesses

IPL

Business Description — IPL is an integrated utility that is engaged primarily in generating, transmitting, distributing and selling electric energy to retail customers in the city of Indianapolis and neighboring areas within the state of Indiana and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. IPL has an exclusive right to provide electric service to the customers in its service area, covering about 528 square miles with an estimated population of approximately 955,000 people. IPL owns and operates four generating stations, all within the state of Indiana. IPL’s largest generating station, Petersburg, is coal-fired. The second largest station, Harding Street, uses natural gas and fuel oil to power combustion turbines. In addition, IPL operates a 20 MW battery-based energy storage unit at Harding Street, which provides frequency response. The third station, Eagle Valley, is a CCGT natural gas plant. IPL took operational control and commenced commercial operations of this CCGT in April 2018. The fourth station, Georgetown, is a small peaking station that uses natural gas to power combustion turbines. In addition, IPL helps meet its customers' energy needs with long-term contracts for the purchase of 96 MW of solar-generated electricity and 300 MW of wind-generated electricity.

Key Financial Drivers — IPL's financial results are driven primarily by retail demand, weather, and maintenance costs. In addition, IPL's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•regulatory outcomes;

•the passage of new legislation, implementation of regulations or other changes in regulation; and

•the timely recovery of capital expenditures.

15 | 2019 Annual Report

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — IPL is subject to comprehensive regulation by the IURC with respect to its services and facilities, retail rates and charges, the issuance of long-term securities, and certain other matters. The regulatory authority of the IURC over IPL's business is typical of regulation generally imposed by state public utility commissions. The IURC sets tariff rates for electric service provided by IPL. The IURC considers all allowable costs for ratemaking purposes, including a fair return on assets used and useful to providing service to customers.

IPL's tariff rates consist of basic rates and approved charges. In addition, IPL's rates include various adjustment mechanisms, including, but not limited to: (i) a rider to reflect changes in fuel and purchased power costs to meet IPL's retail load requirements, (ii) a rider to reflect changes in ongoing RTO costs, and (iii) a rider for the timely recovery of demand side management energy efficiency program costs. These components function somewhat independently of one another, but the overall structure of IPL's rates is subject to review at the time of any review of IPL's basic rates and charges. Additionally, IPL's rider recoveries are reviewed through recurring filings.

On October 31, 2018, the IURC issued an order approving an uncontested settlement agreement to increase IPL's annual revenues by $44 million, or 3% (the "2018 Rate Order"). This revenue increase primarily includes recovery through rates of costs associated with the CCGT at Eagle Valley, completed in the first half of 2018, and other construction projects. New base rates and charges became effective on December 5, 2018. The order also provides customers with approximately $50 million in benefits, including tax reform benefits associated with the TCJA, over a two-year period through a rate adjustment mechanism beginning in March 2019.

IPL is one of many transmission system owner members in MISO, an RTO which maintains functional control over the combined transmission systems of its members and manages one of the largest energy and ancillary services markets in the U.S. MISO operates on a merit order dispatch, considering transmission constraints and other reliability issues to meet the total demand in the MISO region. IPL offers electricity in the MISO day-ahead and real-time markets. 

Development Strategy — IPL's construction program is composed of capital expenditures necessary for prudent utility operations and compliance with environmental regulations, along with discretionary investments designed to replace aging equipment or improve overall performance. 

Senate Enrolled Act 560, the Transmission, Distribution, and Storage System Improvement Charge ("TDSIC") statute provides for cost recovery outside of a base rate proceeding for new or replacement electric and gas transmission, distribution, and storage projects that a public utility undertakes for the purposes of safety, reliability, system modernization, or economic development. Provisions of the TDSIC statute require that requests for recovery include a seven-year plan of eligible investments. Once a plan is approved by the IURC, eighty percent of eligible costs can be recovered using a periodic rate adjustment mechanism, referred to as a TDSIC mechanism. Recoverable costs include a return on, and of, the investment, including AFUDC, post-in-service carrying charges, operation and maintenance expenses, depreciation and property taxes. The remaining twenty percent of recoverable costs are deferred for future recovery in the public utility’s next general rate case. The TDSIC mechanism is capped at an annual increase of two percent of total retail revenues.

In July 2019, IPL filed a petition with the IURC seeking approval of a seven-year TDSIC Plan for eligible transmission, distribution and storage system improvements totaling $1.2 billion from 2020 through 2027. An IURC order is expected in the first quarter of 2020. After such order is issued, IPL will file a petition to set the rider rates and begin TDSIC recovery, which is expected to occur in the second half of 2020.

Integrated Resource Plan — In December 2019, IPL filed its Integrated Resource Plan ("IRP"), which describes IPL's Preferred Resource Portfolio for meeting its generation capacity needs for serving its retail customers over the next several years. IPL's Preferred Resource Portfolio is IPL's reasonable least cost option and provides a cleaner and more diverse generation mix for customers. The IRP includes the retirement of 630 MW of coal-fired generation by 2023. Based on extensive modeling, IPL has determined that the cost of operating Petersburg Units 1 and 2 exceeds the value customers receive compared to alternative resources. Retirement of these units allows the company to cost-effectively diversify the portfolio and transition to cheaper and cleaner resources while maintaining a reliable system. 

IPL issued an all-source Request for Proposal on December 20, 2019, in order to competitively procure replacement capacity by June 1, 2023, which is the first year IPL is expected to have a capacity shortfall. Current modeling indicates that a combination of wind, solar, storage, and energy efficiency would be the lowest reasonable 

16 | 2019 Annual Report

cost option for the replacement capacity, but IPL will assess the type, size, and location of resources after bids are received.

DPL 

Business Description — DPL is an energy holding company whose principal subsidiaries include DP&L and AES Ohio Generation, LLC, both of which operate in Ohio. DP&L is a utility company that transmits and distributes electricity to retail customers in a 6,000 square mile area of West Central Ohio and is subject to regulatory authority—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. DP&L has the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services to its customers, and procures retail SSO electric service on behalf of residential, commercial, industrial and governmental customers through a competitive bid auction process. AES Ohio Generation owns an undivided interest in Conesville Unit 4, a coal-fired generating unit, and sells all of its energy and capacity into the wholesale market. The Conesville facility is planned to close in May 2020. AES Ohio Generation has systematically been exiting its generation business in recent years. In May 2018 AES Ohio Generation retired its Stuart and Killen facilities and completed the transfer of these facilities to a third party in December 2019. 

Key Financial Drivers — DPL's financial results are primarily driven by regulatory outcomes and customer growth within our service territory. In addition, DPL's financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•the passage of new legislation, new regulations or other changes in regulation;

•timely recovery of transmission and distribution expenditures; and

•exiting remaining generation assets currently owned by AES Ohio Generation.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — DP&L is regulated by the PUCO for its distribution services and facilities, retail rates and charges, reliability of service, compliance with renewable energy portfolio requirements, energy efficiency program requirements, and certain other matters. The PUCO maintains jurisdiction over the delivery of electricity, standard service offer ("SSO"), and other retail electric services. 

Electric customers within Ohio are permitted to purchase power under contract from a CRES provider or from their local utility under SSO rates. The SSO generation supply is provided by third parties through a competitive bid process. Ohio utilities have the exclusive right to provide transmission and distribution services in their state-certified territories. While Ohio allows customers to choose retail generation providers, DP&L is required to provide retail generation service at SSO rates to any customer that has not signed a contract with a CRES provider or as a provider of last resort in the event of a CRES provider default. SSO rates are subject to rules and regulations of the PUCO and are established through a competitive bid process for the supply of power to SSO customers. 

DP&L's distribution rates are regulated by the PUCO and are established through a traditional cost-based rate-setting process. DP&L is permitted to recover its costs of providing distribution service as well as earn a regulated rate of return on assets, determined by the regulator, based on the utility's allowed regulated asset base, capital structure and cost of capital. DP&L's retail rates include various adjustment mechanisms including, but not limited to, the timely recovery of costs incurred related to power purchased through the competitive bid process, participation in the PJM RTO, severe storm damage, and energy efficiency. DP&L's wholesale transmission and distribution rates are regulated by FERC.

DP&L is a member of PJM, an RTO that operates the transmission systems owned by utilities operating in all or parts of a multi-state region, including Ohio. PJM also administers the day-ahead and real-time energy markets, ancillary services market and forward capacity market for its members.

In September 2018, DP&L received an order from the PUCO establishing new base distribution rates for DP&L (“the order”), which became effective October 1, 2018. The order approved, without modification, a stipulation and recommendation previously filed by DP&L, along with various intervening parties, with the PUCO staff. The order established a revenue requirement of $248 million for DP&L's electric service base distribution rates, which reflects an increase to distribution revenues of $30 million per year. In addition, the order authorized DP&L to collect from customers costs related to qualified investments through a Distribution Investment Rider, changed the Decoupling Rider to reduce variability from the impact of weather and demand, partially resolved regulatory issues related to the TCJA, and authorized DP&L to defer certain vegetation management costs for future collection.

Ohio law requires utilities to provide their customers a default generation service, known as an SSO, which can be in the form of an electric security plan ("ESP") or a market rate offer ("MRO"), submitted for approval to the PUCO. The PUCO approved DP&L’s Electric Security Plan (“ESP 3”) for a six-year period beginning on November 

17 | 2019 Annual Report

1, 2017. The ESP 3 established a Distribution Modernization Rider (“DMR”) with an initial three-year term to collect $105 million in revenue per year through October 2020 to pay debt obligations at DPL and DP&L and position DP&L to modernize and/or maintain its transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as additional riders to collect several types of ongoing costs and incremental investment. 

On November 21, 2019 the PUCO issued an order modifying the ESP 3 by removing the DMR. As a result, DP&L made a filing which requested to revert DP&L to the ESP rates that were in effect prior to the ESP 3 (the “ESP 1 Rates”) and to maintain several riders from ESP 3. Effective December 18, 2019, the PUCO partially approved this request including authorizing the collection of a Rate Stability Charge ("RSC") of approximately $79 million per year, but disallowing the Regulatory Compliance Rider, Uncollectible Rider, Distribution Investment Rider, which had authorized DP&L to timely recover qualified investments in its distribution network, and the Decoupling Rider, which was designed to eliminate the impacts of weather and other changes in customer demand. 

Separate from the ESP process, in the first quarter of 2020, DP&L filed a separate petition seeking authority to record regulatory assets to accrue revenues that would have otherwise been collected under the ESP 3 through the Decoupling Rider. The outcome of this petition is unknown at this time.

Development Strategy — Planned construction projects primarily relate to new investments in and upgrades to DPL's transmission and distribution system. Capital projects are subject to continuing review and are revised in light of changes in financial and economic conditions, load forecasts, legislative and regulatory developments, and changing environmental standards, among other factors. 

DP&L is projecting to spend an estimated $621 million on capital projects from 2020 through 2022. DP&L expects to finance this construction with a combination of cash on hand, short-term financing, long-term debt and cash flows from operations.

In December 2018, DP&L filed a Distribution Modernization Plan with the PUCO proposing to invest $576 million in capital projects over the next 20 years, which includes leveraging technologies to modernize and improve the sustainability of the grid, and enhancing customer experience and security, as well as to allow DP&L to leverage and integrate distributed energy resources into its grid, including community solar, energy storage, microgrids and electric vehicle charging infrastructure. A decision on this filing from the PUCO is still pending.

Non-renewable U.S. Generation 

Business Description — In the U.S., we own a diversified generation portfolio. The principal markets and locations where we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) are the California Independent System Operator ("CAISO"), PJM, and Hawaii. AES Southland, operating in the CAISO, is our most significant generation business. 

Many of our non-renewable U.S. generation plants provide baseload operations and are required to maintain a guaranteed level of availability. Any change in availability has a direct impact on financial performance. Some plants are eligible for availability bonuses if they meet certain requirements. Coal and natural gas are used as the primary fuels. Coal prices are set by market factors internationally, while natural gas prices are generally set domestically. Price variations for these fuels can change the composition of generation costs and energy prices in our generation businesses. 

Many of these generation businesses have entered into long-term PPAs with utilities or other offtakers. Some businesses with PPAs have mechanisms to recover fuel costs from the offtaker, including an energy payment partially based on the market price of fuel. When market price fluctuations in fuel are borne by the offtaker, revenue may change as fuel prices fluctuate, but the variable margin or profitability should remain consistent. These businesses often have an opportunity to increase or decrease profitability from payments under their PPAs depending on such items as plant efficiency and availability, heat rate, ability to buy coal at lower costs through AES' global sourcing program, and fuel flexibility.

Several of our non-renewable generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as QFs, including Hawaii and Warrior Run, as defined under the PURPA. These businesses entered into long-term contracts with electric utilities that had a mandatory obligation to purchase power from QFs at the utility's avoided cost (i.e., the likely costs for both energy and capital investment that would have been incurred by the purchasing utility if that utility had to provide its own generating capacity or purchase it from another source). To be a QF, a cogeneration facility must produce electricity and useful thermal energy for an industrial or commercial process or heating or cooling applications in certain proportions to the facility's total energy output and meet certain efficiency standards. To be a 

18 | 2019 Annual Report

QF, a small power production facility must generally use a renewable resource as its energy input and meet certain size criteria. 

Our non-QF generation businesses in the U.S. currently operate as Exempt Wholesale Generators as defined under the EPAct of 1992. These businesses, subject to approval of FERC, have the right to sell power at market-based rates, either directly to the wholesale market or to a third-party offtaker such as a power marketer or utility/industrial customer. Under the FPA and FERC's regulations, approval from FERC to sell wholesale power at market-based rates is generally dependent upon a showing to FERC that the seller lacks market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. 

The U.S. wholesale electricity market consists of multiple distinct regional markets that are subject to both federal regulation, as implemented by FERC, and regional regulation as defined by rules designed and implemented by the RTOs, non-profit corporations that operate the regional transmission grid and maintain organized markets for electricity. These rules, for the most part, govern such items as the determination of the market mechanism for setting the system marginal price for energy and the establishment of guidelines and incentives for the addition of new capacity. See Item 1A.—Risk Factors for additional discussion on U.S. regulatory matters.

AES Southland

Business Description — AES Southland is one of the largest generation operators in California by aggregate installed capacity. With an installed gross capacity of 2,312 MW at the end of 2019, AES Southland accounts for approximately 3% of the state's installed capacity and 8% of the peak demand in SCE's territory. The three coastal power plants comprising AES Southland are in areas that are critical for local reliability and play an important role in integrating the increasing amounts of renewable generation resources in California.

 At the end of 2019, five of the twelve Southland generation units were retired to support the construction efforts of the combined cycle re-powering project, in anticipation of reaching COD in early 2020. The remaining AES once-through cooling ("OTC") generating units in California will be shutdown and permanently retired by December 31, 2020 unless the California State Water Resources Board ("SWRCB") extends the OTC Policy compliance date for these units to maintain electrical system reliability. On January 23, 2020, the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures ("SACCWIS") adopted a recommendation to present to the SWRCB to extend the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach and AES Alamitos until December 31, 2023 and AES Redondo Beach until December 31, 2021. The SWRCB is expected to act on the SACCWIS recommendation in the summer of 2020. See United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations—Cooling Water Intake for further discussion of AES Southland’s plans regarding the OTC Policy.

Southland projects AES Huntington Beach, LLC, AES Alamitos, LLC and AES Redondo Beach are contracted through Resource Adequacy Purchase Agreements (the “RAPAs”), through December 31, 2020. Under the RAPAs, as approved by the California Public Utilities Commission, these generating stations provide resource adequacy capacity, and have no obligation to produce or sell any energy to the RAPA counterparty. However, the generating stations are required to bid energy into the California ISO markets. Compensation under these RAPAs is dependent on the availability of the AES Southland units in the California ISO market. Failure to achieve the minimum availability target would result in an assessed penalty.

Re-powering — In November 2014, AES Southland was awarded 20-year contracts by SCE to provide 1,284 MW of combined cycle gas-fired generation and 100 MW of interconnected battery-based energy storage. The agreements for the combined cycle gas-fired generation were amended in 2019 and capacity was increased to 1,299 MW. The contracts are resource adequacy agreements with annual energy put options. If AES Southland exercises the annual put option, all capacity, energy and ancillary services will be sold to SCE in exchange for a fixed monthly fee that covers fixed operating cost, debt service, and return on capital. In addition, SCE will reimburse variable costs and provide the natural gas. If the annual put option is not elected, Southland can sell energy and ancillary services for the coming year to other market counterparties rather than under the agreements with SCE.

In April 2017, the California Energy Commission unanimously approved the licenses for the new combined cycle projects at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. In June 2017, AES closed the financing of $2.0 billion, funded with a combination of non-recourse debt and AES equity. The construction of this new capacity started in 2017 and commercial operation of the combined cycle gas-fired capacity projects was reached in early February 2020. Commercial operation of the energy storage capacity is expected in 2021.

19 | 2019 Annual Report

Key Financial Drivers — AES Southland's availability is one of the most important drivers of operations along with market demand and prices for gas and electricity. 

AES Hawaii

AES Hawaii receives a fuel payment from its offtaker under a PPA expiring in 2022, which is based on a fixed rate indexed to the Gross National Product Implicit Price Deflator. Since the fuel payment is not directly linked to market prices for fuel, the risk arising from fluctuations in market prices for coal is borne by AES Hawaii. AES Hawaii has entered into fixed-price coal purchase commitments through the second quarter of 2020 and plans to seek additional fuel purchase commitments to manage fuel price risk after December 2020. 

Key Financial Drivers — AES Hawaii's financial results are driven by fuel costs and outages. The Company has entered into long-term fuel contracts to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuating prices. In addition, major maintenance requiring units to be off-line is performed during periods when power demand is typically lower. The Hawaii Public Utilities Commission continues to oversee the local utilities' compliance with the renewable portfolio standards established by the State of Hawaii, mandating 100% of Hawaii's generation to be from renewable resources by 2045. 

Puerto Rico

Business Description — AES Puerto Rico owns and operates a coal-fired cogeneration plant and a solar plant of 524 MW and 24 MW, respectively, representing approximately 8% of the installed capacity in Puerto Rico. Both plants are fully contracted through long-term PPAs with PREPA expiring in 2027 and 2032, respectively. AES Puerto Rico receives a capacity payment based on the plant’s twelve month rolling average availability, receiving the full payment when the availability is 90% or higher. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Trends and Uncertainties—Macroeconomic and Political—Puerto Rico for further discussion of the long-term PPA with PREPA.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•improved operational performance; and

•plant availability.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Puerto Rico has a single electric grid managed by PREPA, a state-owned entity that provides virtually all of the electric power consumed in Puerto Rico and generates, transmits and distributes electricity to 1.5 million customers. The Puerto Rico Energy Bureau is the main regulatory body. The bureau approves wholesale and retail rates, sets efficiency and interconnection standards, and oversees PREPA's compliance with Puerto Rico's renewable portfolio standard.

Puerto Rico's electricity is 97% produced by thermal plants (38% from petroleum, 40% from natural gas, 19% from coal). 

U.S. Renewables

AES' U.S. renewables platform comprises AES Distributed Energy, sPower and other renewable assets in the U.S. AES Distributed Energy develops, constructs and sells electricity generated by photovoltaic solar energy systems and wind turbine energy systems, as well as energy storage systems, to public sector, utility, and non-profit entities through PPAs. Generation capacity of the systems owned and/or operated by AES Distributed Energy is 286 MW across the U.S. with another 149 MW under construction. sPower, an AES equity affiliate, owns and/or operates 156 utility and distributed electrical generation systems with a capacity of 1,367 MW across the U.S. sPower continues actively buying, developing and constructing renewable assets in the U.S.

Excluding sPower wind plants, AES has 730 MW of wind capacity in the U.S., located in California, Texas and West Virginia. Mountain View I & II, Mountain View IV and Buffalo Gap I sell under long-term PPAs through which the energy price on the entire production of these facilities is guaranteed. Laurel Mountain, Buffalo Gap II and Buffalo Gap III are exposed to the volatility of energy prices and their revenue may change materially as energy prices fluctuate in their respective markets of operations. Laurel Mountain Wind also operates 16 MW of battery energy storage that is sold into the PJM market as regulation energy. 

AES manages the U.S. renewables portfolio as part of its broader investments in the U.S. A portion of solar projects, including at sPower, and the majority of wind projects have been financed with tax equity structures. Under these tax equity structures, the tax equity investors receive a portion of the economic attributes of the facilities, 

20 | 2019 Annual Report

including tax attributes that vary over the life of the projects. Based on certain liquidation provisions of the tax equity structures, this could result in variability to earnings attributable to AES compared to the earnings reported at the facilities. 

Key Financial Drivers — The financial results of the U.S. wind platform are primarily driven by increased production due to more efficient turbines, faster and less turbulent wind and reduced turbine outages. In addition, PJM and ERCOT power prices impact financial results for the wind projects that are operating without long-term contracts for all or some of their capacity. The financial results of the U.S. solar platform are primarily driven by the amount of sunshine hours available at the facilities, cell maintenance and growth in projects. 

Development Strategy — sPower has a development pipeline that includes 1,577 MW of projects for which long-term PPAs have been signed. The budget for construction of the projects currently under construction and the contracted projects is over $1.86 billion. AES Distributed Energy has a development pipeline that includes 476 MW of projects for which long-term PPAs have been signed or, as applicable, tariffs have been assigned through a regulatory process. The U.S. wind platform is reviewing opportunities to repower older existing projects and adding energy storage where feasible. The budget for construction of the projects currently under construction and the contracted projects is over $1 billion.

U.S. Environmental Regulation

For information on compliance with environmental regulations see Item 1.—United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations.

El Salvador 

Business Description — AES El Salvador is the majority owner of four of the five distribution companies operating in El Salvador (CAESS, CLESA, EEO and DEUSEM). AES El Salvador's territory covers 80% of the country and accounted for 3,841 GWh of the wholesale market energy sales during 2019. AES El Salvador is also a 50% owner and operator of Bosforo, a 100 MW solar farm that became fully operational at the end of 2019. The energy produced by this solar farm is fully contracted by AES' utilities in El Salvador.

 In addition, AES El Salvador offers customers non-regulated services such as energy trading, electromechanical construction, O&M of electrical assets, EPC, pole rental, and tax collection for municipalities. 

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•improved operational performance; 

•variability in energy demand driven by weather; and

•fuel oil prices impact energy tariff prices, which affect cash flow due to a three month delay in the passthrough of energy costs to the tariffs charged to customers.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — El Salvador's national electric market is composed of generation, distribution, transmission and marketing businesses, a market and system operator and regulatory agencies. The operation of the transmission system and the wholesale market is based on production costs with a marginal economic model that rewards efficiency and allows investors to have guaranteed profits, while end users receive affordable rates. The energy sector is governed by the General Electricity Law, which establishes two regulatory entities responsible for monitoring its compliance: 

•The National Energy Council is the highest authority on energy policy and strategy, and the coordinating body for the different energy sectors. One of its main objectives is to promote investment in non-conventional renewable sources to diversify the energy matrix.

•The General Superintendence of Electricity and Telecommunications regulates the market and sets consumer prices, and, jointly with the distribution companies in El Salvador, developed the tariff calculation applicable from 2018 until 2022. The next tariff calculation is scheduled for 2022, and will be effective starting 2023.

El Salvador has a national electric grid that interconnects directly with Guatemala and Honduras, allowing transactions with all Central American countries. The sector has approximately 1,689 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal (42%), hydroelectric (33%), geothermal (10%), biomass (9%) and solar (6%) generation plants.

Development Strategy — In order to explore new business opportunities, in 2018 AES El Salvador created 

21 | 2019 Annual Report

AES Soluciones, an LED public lighting service provider and the main commercial and industrial solar photovoltaic EPC provider in the country. AES Next is also the O&M services provider for the Bosforo project.

Chile

Business Description — In Chile, through AES Gener, we are engaged in the generation and supply of electricity (energy and capacity) in the SEN—see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below. AES Gener is the second largest generation operator in Chile in terms of installed capacity with 3,488 MW, excluding energy storage, and has a market share of approximately 13% as of December 31, 2019.

AES Gener owns a diversified generation portfolio in Chile in terms of geography, technology, customers and fuel source. AES Gener's plants are located near the principal electricity consumption centers, including Santiago, Valparaiso and Antofagasta. AES Gener's diverse generation portfolio provides flexibility for the management of contractual obligations with regulated and unregulated customers, provides backup energy to the spot market and facilitates operations under a variety of market and hydrological conditions. 

AES Gener's Green Blend and Extend strategy aims to reduce carbon intensity and incorporate renewable energy to extend our existing conventional PPAs. This strategy de-links our PPAs from legacy fossil resources, grows our renewable energy portfolio and delivers a competitive, reliable energy solution. In line with the "green blend and extend" strategy, AES Gener has committed to not build additional coal-based power plants and to advance the development of new renewable projects, including the implementation of technological innovations that will provide greater flexibility and reliability to the system.

AES Gener currently has long-term contracts, with an average remaining term of approximately 10 years, with regulated distribution companies and unregulated customers, such as mining and industrial companies. In general, these long-term contracts include pass-through mechanisms for fuel costs along with price indexations to U.S. CPI.

In addition to energy payments, AES Gener also receives capacity payments to compensate for availability during periods of peak demand. The grid operator, CEN, annually determines the capacity requirements for each power plant. The capacity price is fixed semiannually by the National Energy Commission and indexed to the CPI and other relevant indices.

26 | 2019 Annual Report

Key Financial Drivers — Hedge strategy at AES Gener limits volatility to the underlying financial drivers. In addition, financial results are likely to be driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 

•dry hydrology scenarios; 

•forced outages; 

•changes in current regulatory rulings altering the ability to pass through or recover certain costs;

•fluctuations of the Chilean peso;

•tax policy changes;

•legislation promoting renewable energy and/or more restrictive regulations on thermal generation assets; and

•market price risk when re-contracting.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Chilean electricity industry is divided into three business segments: generation, transmission and distribution. Private companies operate in all three segments, and generators can enter into PPAs to sell energy to regulated and unregulated customers, as well as to other generators in the spot market.

Chile operates in a single power market, referred to as the SEN, which is managed by the grid operator CEN. Prior to November 2017, Chile had two main power systems, the SIC and SING, largely as a result of its geographic shape and size, which were merged to form the SEN. The SEN has an installed capacity of 25,206 MW, and represents 99% of the installed generation capacity of the country.

CEN coordinates all generation and transmission companies in the SEN. CEN minimizes the operating costs of the electricity system, while maximizing service quality and reliability requirements. CEN dispatches plants in merit order based on their variable cost of production, allowing for electricity to be supplied at the lowest available cost. In the south-central region of the SEN (former SIC), thermoelectric generation is required to fulfill demand not satisfied by hydroelectric, solar and wind output and is critical to provide reliable and dependable electricity supply under dry hydrological conditions in the highest demand area of the SEN. In the northern region of the SEN (former SING), which includes the Atacama Desert, thermoelectric capacity represents the majority of installed capacity. The fuels used for thermoelectric generation, mainly coal, diesel and LNG, are indexed to international prices. In 2019, the generation installed capacity in the Chilean market was composed of 52% thermoelectric, 26% hydroelectric, 11% solar, 9% wind and 2% other fuel sources. 

Hydroelectric plants represent a significant portion of the system's installed capacity. Precipitation and snow melt impact hydrological conditions in Chile. Rain occurs principally from June to August and snow melt occurs from September to December. These factors affect dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants, thereby influencing spot market prices. 

The Ministry of Energy has primary responsibility for the Chilean electricity system directly or through the National Energy Commission and the Superintendency of Electricity and Fuels.

All generators can sell energy through contracts with regulated distribution companies or directly to unregulated customers. Unregulated customers are customers whose connected capacity is higher than 5 MW. Customers with connected capacity between 0.5 MW and 5.0 MW can opt for regulated or unregulated contracts for a minimum period of four years. By law, both regulated and unregulated customers are required to purchase all electricity under contracts. Generators may also sell energy to other power generation companies on a short-term basis at negotiated prices outside the spot market. Electricity prices in Chile are denominated in USD, although payments are made in Chilean pesos.

The Chilean government has announced an initiative to phase out coal power plants by 2040 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In June 2019, AES Gener and the Chilean Ministry of Energy signed an agreement to cease operations of AES Gener's oldest coal-fired units, Ventanas units 1 and 2, built in 1964 and 1977, respectively. The agreement outlines a path to gradually phase out coal assets from the system in a manner that mitigates potential adverse impacts on the grid. Executing this agreement depends on the development of regulatory changes to create a new Strategic Reserve Operational State (ERE) in the capacity payment, which is currently pending. Both Ventanas units are expected to remain connected to the grid and maintained in ERE for five years, and will receive 60% of the current capacity payments. 

Environmental Regulation — In March 2019, a new decontamination plan for the Ventanas region was approved. We are currently implementing the requirements defined by the plan which will impact our Ventanas and 

27 | 2019 Annual Report

Guacolda businesses.

Chilean law requires all electricity generators to supply a certain portion of their total contractual obligations with NCREs. Generation companies are able to meet this requirement by building NCRE generation capacity (wind, solar, biomass, geothermal and small hydroelectric technology) or purchasing NCREs from qualified generators. Non-compliance with the NCRE requirements will result in fines. AES Gener currently fulfills the NCRE requirements by utilizing AES Gener's solar and biomass power plants and by purchasing NCREs from other generation companies. At present, AES Gener is in the process of negotiating additional NCRE supply contracts to meet future requirements. 

Since 2017, emissions of particulate matter, SO2, NOx and CO2 are monitored for plants with an installed capacity over 50 MW; these emissions are taxed. In the case of CO2, the tax is equivalent to $5 per ton emitted. PPAs originating from the SING have clauses allowing the Company to pass the green tax costs to unregulated customers. Distribution PPAs originating from the SIC do not allow for the pass through of these costs. 

Development Strategy — AES Gener is committed to reducing the coal intensity of the Chilean power grid and plans to increase the renewable energy capacity in its portfolio. As part of this commitment, and in addition to the 531 MW hydroelectric generation that Alto Maipo will deliver to the system, AES Gener purchased the 110 MW Los Cururos wind farm and its substation in northern Chile and has started construction on various solar and wind farms across Chile to supply agreements with its main mining customers in execution of the new Green Blend and Extend strategy. In addition, AES Gener broke ground on its Virtual Reservoir Energy Storage pilot project next to the existing Alfalfal I run-of-river hydro plant close to Santiago, Chile. 

AES Gener executes its Green Blend and Extend strategy by integrating renewable energy sources into its portfolio, and by providing contracting options that contain a mix of both renewable and nonrenewable solutions. 

Colombia

Business Description — We operate in Colombia through AES Chivor, a subsidiary of AES Gener, which owns a hydroelectric plant with an installed capacity of 1,000 MW and Tunjita, a 20 MW run-of-river hydroelectric plant, both located approximately 160 km east of Bogota, as well as Castilla, a 21 MW solar facility. AES Chivor’s installed capacity accounted for approximately 6% of system capacity at the end of 2019. AES Chivor is dependent on hydrological conditions, which influence generation and spot prices of non-contracted generation in Colombia.

AES Chivor's commercial strategy aims to execute contracts with commercial and industrial customers and bid in public tenders mainly with distribution companies in order to reduce margin volatility with proper portfolio risk management. The remaining energy generated by our portfolio is sold to the spot market, including ancillary services. Additionally, AES Chivor receives reliability payments for maintaining the plant's availability during periods of power scarcity, such as adverse hydrological conditions, in order to prevent power shortages. 

Key Financial Drivers — Hydrological conditions largely influence Chivor's power generation. Maintaining the appropriate contract level, while maximizing revenue through the sale of excess generation, is key to Chivor's results of operations. In addition to hydrology, financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 

•forced outages;

•fluctuations of the Colombian peso; and

•spot market prices.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Electricity supply in Colombia is concentrated in one main system, the SIN, which encompasses one-third of Colombia's territory, providing electricity to 97% of the country's population. The SIN's installed capacity, primarily hydroelectric (69%) and thermal (31%), totaled 17,365 MW as of December 31, 2019. The marked seasonal variations in Colombia's hydrology result in price volatility in the short-term market. In 2019, 80% of total energy demand was supplied by hydroelectric plants.

The electricity sector in Colombia operates under a competitive market framework for the generation and sale of electricity, and a regulated framework for transmission and distribution of electricity. The distinct activities of the electricity sector are governed by Colombian laws and CREG, the Colombian regulating entity for energy and gas. Other government entities have a role in the electricity industry, including the Ministry of Mines and Energy, which defines the government's policy for the energy sector; the Public Utility Superintendency of Colombia, which is in charge of overseeing utility companies; and the Mining and Energy Planning Unit, which is in charge of expansion of the generation and transmission network. 

28 | 2019 Annual Report

The generation sector is organized on a competitive basis with companies selling their generation in the wholesale market at the short-term price or under bilateral contracts with other participants, including distribution companies, generators and traders, and unregulated customers at freely negotiated prices. The National Dispatch Center dispatches generators in merit order based on bid offers in order to ensure that demand will be satisfied by the lowest cost combination of available generating units.

In the third quarter of 2019, the Ministry of Mines and Energy published the final resolution for the renewable energy auction in Colombia. The auction allocates 15-year energy contracts for 4.4 TW/h of energy demand to reach commercial operation between 2022 and 2023. AES Chivor participated in the auction process and was awarded 255 MW of renewable generation.

Argentina

Business Description — AES operates plants in Argentina totaling 4,004 MW, representing 10% of the country's total installed capacity. AES owns a diversified generation portfolio in Argentina in terms of geography, technology and fuel source. AES Argentina's plants are placed in strategic locations within the country in order to provide energy to the spot market and customers, making use of wind, hydro and thermal plants.

AES primarily sells its energy in the wholesale electricity market where prices are largely regulated. In 2019, approximately 93% of the energy was sold in the wholesale electricity market and 7% was sold under contract sales made by TermoAndes.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 

•forced outages; 

•exposure to fluctuations of the Argentine peso;

•changes in hydrology;

•timely collection of FONINVEMEM installments and outstanding receivables (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below); and

•natural gas prices and availability for contracted generation.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Argentina has one main power system, the SADI, which serves 96% of the country. As of December 31, 2019, the installed capacity of the SADI totaled 39,704 MW. The SADI's installed capacity is composed primarily of thermoelectric generation (62%) and hydroelectric generation (27%). 

Thermoelectric generation in the SADI is primarily natural gas. However, scarcity of natural gas during winter periods (June to August) due to transport constraints result in the use of alternative fuels, such as oil and coal. The SADI is also highly reliant on hydroelectric plants. Hydrological conditions impact reservoir water levels and largely influence the dispatch of the system's hydroelectric and thermoelectric generation plants and, therefore, influence market costs. Precipitation in Argentina occurs principally from June to August. 

The Argentine regulatory framework divides the electricity sector into generation, transmission and distribution. The wholesale electric market is comprised of generation companies, transmission companies, distribution companies and large customers who are permitted to trade electricity. Generation companies can sell their output in the spot market or under PPAs. CAMMESA manages the electricity market and is responsible for dispatch coordination. The Electricity National Regulatory Agency is in charge of regulating public service activities and the Secretariat of Energy regulates system framework and grants concessions or authorizations for sector activities. In Argentina, there is a tolling scheme in which the regulator establishes prices for electricity and defines fuel reference prices. As a result, our businesses are particularly sensitive to changes in regulation.

The Argentine electric market is an "average cost" system. Generators are compensated for fixed costs and non-fuel variable costs plus a rate of return, under prices denominated in USD. Generation companies can buy fuel directly from producers or from CAMMESA.

Long-term USD-denominated PPAs have been awarded to develop 9.1 GW of new thermal and renewable capacity through the execution of competitive auctions. During 2019, the government has continued to increase end user prices to reduce subsidies and decrease system deficit. By December 2019, distribution companies recovered an average 58% of the total cost of the system.

AES Argentina contributed certain accounts receivable to fund the construction of new power plants under FONINVEMEM agreements. These receivables accrue interest and are collected in monthly installments over 10 

29 | 2019 Annual Report

years once the related plants begin to operate. AES Argentina participated in three FONINVEMEM funds related to operational plants under which payments are being received. AES Argentina will receive a pro rata ownership interest in these plants once the accounts receivables have been fully repaid. FONINVEMEM I and II installments were fully repaid in February 2020 and the ownership interests in Termoeléctrica San Martín and Termoeléctrica Manuel Belgrano power plants are subject to agreement between the government and all generators that participated in the funds. FONINVEMEM III installments continue being collected since Termoeléctrica Guillermo Brown commenced operations in April 2016. See Item 7.—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Long-Term Receivables and Note 7.—Financing Receivables in Item 8.—Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for further discussion of receivables in Argentina.

In 2018 and 2019, the Argentine peso devalued against the USD by approximately 51% and 37%, respectively, and Argentina’s economy continued to be highly inflationary. In September 2019, currency controls were established to control the devaluation of the Argentine peso and keep Argentine central bank reserves at acceptable levels for the next government of Argentina. 

Development Strategy — Vientos Bonaerenses, a 100 MW wind farm in Buenos Aires province, reached COD in February 2020. A second 100 MW wind facility under construction in Neuquén province is expected to come online by mid-2020. From that total, 80 MW will be sold to CAMMESA with a PPA under the RenovAr (public auction) program and 120 MW will be sold to commercial and industrial clients. Currently, 800 MW of renewable greenfield projects are in early stages of development. These projects could be used to participate in private PPAs or public auctions.

Brazil

Business Description — Tietê has a portfolio of 12 hydroelectric power plants in the state of São Paulo with total installed capacity of 2,658 MW. These hydroelectric plants operate under a 30-year concession expiring in 2029. Over the past two years, Tietê acquired and developed two solar power complexes in the state of São Paulo, which are fully contracted with 20-year PPAs and together account for 294 MW of installed capacity. Tietê represents approximately 11% of the total generation capacity in the state of São Paulo. Tietê also owns Alto Sertão II, a wind complex located in the state of Bahia, with an installed capacity of 386 MW and subject to 20-year PPAs expiring between 2033 and 2035. 

AES owns 24% of Tietê and is the controlling shareholder and manages and consolidates this business. Tietê aims to contract most of its physical guarantee requirements and sell the remaining portion in the spot market. The commercial strategy is reassessed periodically according to changes in market conditions, hydrology and other factors. Tietê generally sells available energy through medium-term bilateral contracts. 

Uruguaiana is a 640 MW gas-fired combined cycle power plant located in the town of Uruguaiana in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. AES manages and has a 46% economic interest in the plant. The plant's operations have been largely suspended due to the unavailability of gas. Uruguaiana continues to work toward securing gas on a long-term basis.

Key Financial Drivers — The electricity market in Brazil is highly dependent on hydroelectric generation, therefore electricity pricing is driven by hydrology. Plant availability is also a significant financial driver as in times of high hydrology, AES is more exposed to the spot market. Tietê's financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•hydrology, impacting quantity of energy generated in MRE (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below for further information);

•growth in demand for energy;

•market price risk when re-contracting;

•asset management;

•cost management; and

•ability to execute on its growth strategy.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — In Brazil, the Ministry of Mines and Energy determines the maximum amount of energy a generation plant can sell, called physical guarantee, representing the long-term average expected energy production of the plant. Under current rules, physical guarantee energy can be sold to distribution companies through long-term regulated auctions or under unregulated bilateral contracts with large 

30 | 2019 Annual Report

consumers or energy trading companies. 

Brazil has installed capacity of 170 GW, which is primarily hydroelectric (64%) and renewables (19%). Operation is centralized and controlled by the national operator, ONS, and regulated by ANEEL. The ONS dispatches generators based on their marginal cost of production and on the risk of system rationing. Key variables for the dispatch decision are forecasted hydrological conditions, reservoir levels, electricity demand, fuel prices and thermal generation availability. 

In case of unfavorable hydrology, the ONS will reduce hydroelectric dispatch to preserve reservoir levels and increase dispatch of thermal plants to meet demand. The consequences of unfavorable hydrology are (i) higher energy spot prices due to higher energy production costs by thermal plants and (ii) the need for hydro plants to purchase energy in the spot market to fulfill their contractual obligations. 

A mechanism known as the MRE was created under ONS to share hydrological risk across MRE hydro generators. If the hydro plants generate less than the total MRE physical guarantee, the hydro generators may need to purchase energy in the short-term market. When total hydro generation is higher than the total MRE physical guarantee, the surplus is proportionally shared among its participants and they may sell the excess energy on the spot market. 

Development Strategy — Tietê's strategy is to grow by adding renewable capacity to its generation platform through acquisition or greenfield projects. Tietê has signed a purchase option for 582 MW of greenfield wind power projects in the state of Bahia, which is being exercised as the company secures long-term PPAs. The first phase (155 MW) will be developed in 2020 through a joint venture with Unipar Carbocloro for a 20-year PPA starting in 2022. The second phase (167 MW) will be 100% developed by Tietê also in 2020, for a 15-year PPA with Anglo American starting in 2022. Tietê is seeking other long-term PPA's to fulfill the remaining 260 MW.

Under the current terms of the 2018 legal agreement in connection with Tietê's concession with the state government, Tietê is required to increase its capacity in the state of São Paulo by an additional 81 MW by October 2024.

MCAC Businesses

Dominican Republic 

Business Description — AES Dominicana consists of three operating subsidiaries: Itabo, Andres and Los Mina. With a total of 957 MW of installed capacity, AES provides 20% of the country's capacity and supplies approximately 39% of energy demand via these generation facilities. 869 MW is mostly contracted until 2022 with government-owned distribution companies and large customers.

AES has a strategic partnership with the Estrella and Linda Groups ("Estrella-Linda"), a consortium of two leading Dominican industrial groups that manage a diversified business portfolio.

Itabo is 42.5% owned by AES. Itabo owns and operates two thermal power generation units with a total of 260 MW of installed capacity. 

Andres and Los Mina are owned 85% by AES. Andres owns and operates a combined cycle natural gas turbine, an energy storage solution and generation capacity of 329 MW as well as the only LNG import terminal in the country, with 160,000 cubic meters of storage capacity. Los Mina owns and operates a combined cycle with two natural gas turbines, an energy storage solution and generation capacity of 368 MW. 

AES Dominicana has a long-term LNG purchase contract through 2023 for 33.6 trillion btu/year with a price linked to NYMEX Henry Hub. The LNG contract terms allow delivery to various markets in Latin America. These plants capitalize on the competitively-priced LNG contract by selling power where the market is dominated by fuel oil-based generation. Andres has a long-term contract to sell re-gasified LNG to industrial users within the Dominican Republic using compression technology to transport it within the country, thereby capturing demand from industrial and commercial customers.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 

•changes in spot prices due to fluctuations in commodity prices (since fuel is a pass-through cost under the PPAs, any variation in oil prices will impact spot sales for both Andres and Itabo);

•contracting levels and the extent of capacity awarded;

•supply shortages in the near term (next two to three years) may provide opportunities for short-term upside, but new generation came online in 2019; and

34 | 2019 Annual Report

•additional sales derived from domestic natural gas demand are expected to continue providing income and growth based on the entry of future projects and the fees from the infrastructure service.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Dominican Republic energy market is a decentralized industry consisting of generation, transmission and distribution businesses. Generation companies can earn revenue through short- and long-term PPAs, ancillary services, and a competitive wholesale generation market. All generation, transmission and distribution companies are subject to and regulated by the General Electricity Law.

Two main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law: 

•The National Energy Commission drafts and coordinates the legal framework and regulatory legislation. They propose and adopt policies and procedures to implement best practices, support the proper functioning and development of the energy sector, and promote investment. 

•The Superintendence of Electricity's main responsibilities include monitoring compliance with legal provisions, rules, and technical procedures governing generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization of electricity. They monitor behavior in the electricity market in order to avoid monopolistic practices. In addition to the two agencies responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce supervises commercial and industrial activities in the Dominican Republic as well as the fuels and natural gas commercialization to end users. 

The Dominican Republic has one main interconnected system with 4,904 MW of installed capacity, composed of thermal (77%), hydroelectric (15%), wind (5%), solar (2%) and biomass (1%).

Development Strategy — AES will continue to expand its gas business and incorporate partners directly in gas infrastructure projects. AES partnered with Energas in a joint venture to develop and operate the 50 km Eastern Pipeline, which reached commercial operations in February 2020. The joint venture will also develop a new LNG facility, additional storage, regasification and truck loading capacity. This will allow AES to reach new clients who have converted, or are in the process of converting, to natural gas as a fuel source. 

Panama

Business Description — AES owns and operates five hydroelectric plants totaling 705 MW of generation capacity, and two thermoelectric power plants, Estrella del Mar I and Colon, totaling 453 MW of generation capacity, altogether representing 31% of the total installed capacity in Panama. In 2019, Colon's LNG regasification facility and 180,000 cubic meters storage tank were completed and became operational.

The majority of our hydroelectric plants in Panama are based on run-of-river technology, with the exception of the 260 MW Bayano plant. Hydrological conditions have an important influence on profitability. Variations in hydrology can result in an excess or a shortfall in energy production relative to our contractual obligations. Hydro generation is generally in a shortfall position during the dry season from January through May, while thermal assets are expected to be in a long position as their behavior is opposite and complementary to hydro generation.

Our hydro and thermal assets are mainly contracted through medium- to long-term PPAs with distribution companies. A small volume of our hydro plants are contracted with unregulated users. Our hydro assets in Panama have PPAs with distribution companies up to December 2030 for a total contracted capacity of 350 MW. Our thermal assets in Panama have PPAs with distribution companies for a total contracted capacity of 430 MW, of which 80 MW will expire between June and August 2020 and 350 MW will expire in August 2028. 

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to: 

•changes in hydrology which impacts commodity prices and exposes the business to variability in the cost of replacement power;

•fluctuations in commodity prices, mainly oil and natural gas, affect the cost of thermal generation and spot prices;

•constraints imposed by the capacity of transmission lines connecting the west side of the country with the load, keeping surplus power trapped during the wet season; and

•country demand as GDP growth is expected to remain strong over the short and medium term.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Panamanian power sector is composed of three distinct operating business units: generation, distribution and transmission. Generators can enter into short-term and long-term PPAs with distributors or unregulated consumers. In addition, generators can enter into alternative supply 

35 | 2019 Annual Report

contracts with each other. Outside of PPAs, generators may buy and sell energy in the short-term market. Generators can only contract up to their firm capacity.

Three main agencies are responsible for monitoring compliance with the General Electricity Law: 

•The SNE has the responsibilities of planning, supervising and controlling policies of the energy sector within Panama. With these responsibilities, the SNE proposes laws and regulations to the executive agencies that regulate the procurement of energy and hydrocarbons for the country. 

•The regulator of public services, known as the ASEP, is an autonomous agency of the government. ASEP is responsible for the control and oversight of public services, including electricity, the transmission and distribution of natural gas utilities, and the companies that provide such services.

•The National Dispatch Center implements the economic dispatch of electricity in the wholesale market. The National Dispatch Center's objectives are to minimize the total cost of generation and maintain the reliability and security of the electric power system. Short-term power prices are determined on an hourly basis by the last dispatched generating unit. Physical generation of energy is determined by the National Dispatch Center regardless of contractual arrangements.

Panama's current total installed capacity is 3,682 MW, composed of hydroelectric (48%), thermal (40%), wind (7%) and solar (5%) generation. 

Development Strategy — Given our LNG facility’s excess capacity in Panama, the company will develop natural gas supply solutions for third parties such as power generators and industrial and commercial customers. This strategy will support a growing demand for natural gas in the region and will contribute to the AES mission for a greener energy future by reducing carbon dioxide emissions as a result of using LNG. 

In addition to investing in LNG infrastructure, AES is investing in renewable projects within the region. This will increase complementary non-hydro renewable assets in the system and contribute to the reduction of hydrological risk in Panama.

Mexico

Business Description — AES has 1,361 MW of installed capacity in Mexico. The TEG and TEP pet coke-fired plants, located in Tamuin, San Luis Potosi, supply power to their offtakers under long-term PPAs expiring in 2027 with a 90% availability guarantee. TEG and TEP secure their fuel under a long-term contract. 

Merida is a CCGT, located on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula. Merida sells power to the CFE under a capacity and energy based long-term PPA through 2025. Additionally, the plant purchases natural gas and diesel under a long-term contract with one of the CFE’s subsidiaries, the cost of which is then passed through to the CFE under the terms of the PPA.

Eólica Mesa La Paz, a 306 MW wind project developed under a joint venture with Grupo Bal, achieved commercial operations in December 2019. Starting in 2020, Mesa La Paz will sell power under a long-term PPA expiring in 2045.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•as the companies are fully contracted, improved operational performance provides additional benefits, including performance incentives and/or excess energy sales; and

•changes in the methodology to calculate spot energy prices or Locational Marginal Prices, which impacts the excess energy sales to the CFE (see Regulatory Framework and Market Structure below) in (i) TEG and TEP under self-supply scheme, and (ii) Mesa La Paz under the New Market Rules.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — Mexico has a single electric grid, the National Electricity System, covering all of Mexico's territory through the Interconnected National Electricity, Baja California and Southern Baja California Systems. The market comprises generation, transmission, distribution and commercialization segments.

Three main agencies, in addition to the Ministry of Energy, are responsible for monitoring compliance with the Electric Industry Law: 

•The Energy Regulatory Commission is responsible for the establishment of directives, orders, methodologies and standards to regulate the electric and fuel markets.

36 | 2019 Annual Report

•The National Center for Energy Control, as ISO, is responsible for managing the wholesale electricity market, transmission and distribution infrastructure, planning the network developments, guaranteeing open access to network infrastructure, executing competitive mechanisms to cover regulated demand, and setting transmission charges.

•The CFE owns the transmission and distribution grids and it is also the country's basic supplier. CFE is the offtaker for IPP generators, and together with its own power units has more than 50% of the current generation market share.

Mexico has an installed capacity totaling 76 GW with a generation mix comprising of thermal (71%), hydroelectric (17%), wind (6%), and other fuel sources (6%). 

Development Strategy — AES has partnered in a joint venture with Grupo BAL to co-invest in power and related infrastructure projects in Mexico, focusing on renewable and natural gas generation.

Eurasia Businesses 

Vietnam

Business Description — Mong Duong 2 is a 1,242 MW gross coal-fired plant located in the Quang Ninh Province of Vietnam and was constructed under a BOT service concession agreement expiring in 2040. This is the first and largest coal-fired BOT plant using pulverized coal-fired boiler technology in Vietnam. The BOT company has a PPA with EVN and a Coal Supply Agreement with Vinacomin, both expiring in 2040. 

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to, the operating performance and availability of the facility.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Ministry of Industry and Trade in Vietnam is primarily responsible for formulating a program to restructure the power industry, developing the electricity market, and promulgating electricity market regulations. The fuel supply is owned by the government through Vinacomin, a state-owned entity, and Petro Vietnam. 

The Vietnam power market is divided into three regions (North, Central and South), with total installed capacity of approximately 48 GW. The fuel mix in Vietnam is composed primarily of hydropower at 35% and coal at 38%. EVN, the national utility, owns 58% of installed generation capacity.

The government is in the process of realigning EVN-owned companies into three different independent operations in order to create a competitive power market. The first stage of this realignment was the implementation of the Competitive Electricity Market, which has been in operation since 2012. The second stage was the introduction of the Electricity Wholesale Market, which has been in operation since the beginning of 2019. The third and final stage impacts the Electricity Retail Market, which will undergo similar reforms after 2022. BOT power plants will not directly participate in the power market; alternatively, a single buyer will bid the tariff on the power pool on their behalf. 

Development Strategy — In Vietnam, we continue to advance the development of our Son My LNG terminal project, which has a design capacity of up to 9.6 million metric tonnes per annum, and Son My 2 CCGT 2,250 MW project. In October 2019, we received formal approval as a government-mandated investor in the Son My LNG terminal project in partnership with PetroVietnam Gas. In November 2019, we received formal approval as the government-mandated investor with 100% equity ownership in the Son My 2 CCGT project and executed a statutory memorandum of understanding with Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade to continue developing the 

40 | 2019 Annual Report

project under Vietnam’s Build-Operate-Transfer legal framework. The Son My 2 CCGT will utilize the Son My LNG terminal and be its anchor customer.

Bulgaria

Business Description — Our Maritza plant is a 690 MW lignite fuel thermal power plant. Maritza's entire power output is contracted with NEK, the state-owned electricity supplier and producer and trading company. Maritza is contracted under a 15-year PPA that expires in May 2026. Maritza has been collecting receivables from NEK in a timely manner since 2016. However, NEK's liquidity position remains subject to political conditions and regulatory changes in Bulgaria.

The DG Comp is reviewing NEK’s PPA with Maritza pursuant to the European Commission’s state aid rules. Maritza believes that its PPA is legal and in compliance with all applicable laws. For additional details see Key Trends and Uncertainties in Item 7.— Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K.

AES also owns an 89% economic interest in the St. Nikola wind farm with 156 MW of installed capacity. The power output of St. Nikola is sold to customers operating on the liberalized electricity market and the plant receives additional revenue per the terms of an October 2018 Contract for Premium with the state-owned Electricity Security Fund. 

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•regulatory changes in the Bulgaria power market; 

•results of the DG Comp review; 

•availability of the operating units;

•the level of wind resources for St. Nikola; 

•spot market price volatility beyond the level of compensation through the Contract for Premium for St. Nikola; and

•NEK's ability to meet the payment terms of the PPA contract with Maritza.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The electricity sector in Bulgaria allows both regulated and competitive segments. NEK acts as a single buyer and seller for all regulated transactions on the market. Electricity outside the regulated market trades on one of the platforms of the Independent Bulgarian Electricity Exchange day-ahead market, intra-day market or bilateral contracts market. Bulgaria is working with the European Commission on a model that will allow the gradual phase-out of regulated energy prices starting in July 2020.

Bulgaria’s power sector is supported by a diverse generation mix, universal access to the grid, and numerous cross-border connections in neighboring countries. In addition, it plays an important role in the energy balance in the Balkan region.

Bulgaria has 12 GW of installed capacity enabling the country to meet and exceed domestic demand and export energy. Installed capacity is primarily thermal (40%) and nuclear (36%). 

Environmental Regulation — Best Available Techniques Reference Document for Large Combustion Plants, the new EU environmental standards regulating emissions from the combustion of solid fuels for large combustion plants, was enacted in August 2017 and applies to Maritza. Impacted power plants are required to either meet the new standards or be granted a derogation by August 2021. Maritza requested such derogation from the Bulgarian environmental authorities in 2018, and expects to receive a response in 2020. If derogation is not received Maritza would seek to pass through the compliance costs to NEK pursuant to the PPA.

Jordan

Business Description — In Jordan, AES has a 37% controlling interest in Amman East, a 381 MW oil/gas-fired plant fully contracted with the national utility under a 25-year PPA expiring in 2033, a 36% controlling interest in the IPP4 plant, a 250 MW oil/gas-fired peaker plant, fully contracted with the national utility until 2039, and a 36% controlling interest in a 52 MW solar plant, fully contracted with the national utility under a 20-year PPA expiring in 2039. We consolidate the results in our operations as we have a controlling interest in these businesses.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — The Jordan electricity transmission market is a single-buyer model with the state-owned NEPCO responsible for transmission. NEPCO generally enters into long-term PPAs with IPPs to fulfill energy procurement requests from distribution utilities. The sector is prioritizing renewable energy 

41 | 2019 Annual Report

development, with 2,200 MW of renewable energy installed capacity expected by the end of 2020, 1,300 MW of which is already connected to the grid.

India

Business Description — OPGC I is a 420 MW coal-fired generation facility located in the state of Odisha. OPGC I has a 30-year PPA with GRIDCO Limited, a state utility, expiring in 2026. OPGC II is a 1,320 MW coal-fired generation facility with 75% of its installed capacity contracted with GRIDCO for a period of four years through 2023, and 100% for the next 25 years through 2048. A separate trading arrangement has been negotiated for the remaining 25% of capacity to be sold in the trading market by GRIDCO on behalf of OPGC. OPGC is an unconsolidated entity and its results are reported as Net equity in earnings of affiliates on our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Key Financial Drivers — Financial results are driven by many factors, including, but not limited to:

•operating performance of the facility;

•regulatory and environmental policy changes;

•tariff determination by the OERC; and

•PPA provisions and energy trading.

Regulatory Framework and Market Structure — In India, the power sector is comprised of state and central government-owned and privately-owned generation and distribution utilities. Electricity is sold to state utilities mostly under long-term PPAs and about 10% of electricity is sold in the short-term market, for example, traded on an energy exchange or through competitively bid bilateral contracts. The tariffs are fixed on a yearly basis by the Electricity Regulatory Commissions Central / State(s) for the long-term PPAs or determined through a competitive bidding process. OERC regulates the electricity purchase process for the distribution licensees, including the price at which the electricity from generating companies shall be procured for supply within the state of Odisha. OERC also facilitates intrastate transmission and wheeling of electricity. The electricity regulatory commissions are guided by the Electricity Act, National Electricity Policy, National Electricity Plan and Tariff Policy issued by the Government of India.

The power sector in India is composed of coal, gas, hydroelectric, renewable and nuclear energy. Total installed capacity as of December 31, 2019 was 365 GW, of which 63% is thermal generation. Renewable energy is adding capacity at a rapid pace and currently represents 23% of the total installed capacity. The remaining capacity is hydro (12%) and nuclear (2%).

Environmental Regulation — The Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change in India has amended the Environment (Protection) Rules to require stricter emission limits for thermal power plants by the end of 2021. As a result of this amendment, Selective Catalytic Rectifier and Flue Gas Desulphurization systems are required to be installed in the existing OPGC units to comply with the new NOX and SO2 emissions limits, which will necessitate substantial investment by OPGC. We believe the cost of complying with the new environmental regulations for particulate matters, water consumption, SOx and NOx limits will be a pass-through in the OERC prescribed tariff regulations for both the existing and expansion units.

Development Strategy — India is a high-growth market for renewables and battery energy storage. AES owns and operates a test 10 MW battery energy storage system ("BESS") in Delhi city, located inside a substation of Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited ("TPDDL"). The BESS is integrated with the TPDDL distribution system and provides various frequency regulation services. Discussions for commercial opportunities with TPDDL will commence early next year.

The Company faces certain risks and uncertainties related to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including existing and potential GHG legislation or regulations, and actual or potential laws and regulations pertaining to water discharges, waste management (including disposal of coal combustion residuals), and certain air emissions, such as SO2, NOX, particulate matter, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Such risks and uncertainties could result in increased capital expenditures or other compliance costs which could have a material adverse effect on certain of our U.S. or international subsidiaries, and our consolidated results of operations. For further information about these risks, see Item 1A.—Risk Factors—Our operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes; Several of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR; Our businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations; and Concerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of the laws and regulations of individual countries within each SBU where our subsidiaries operate, see discussion within Item 1.—Business of this Form 10-K under the applicable SBUs.

Many of the countries in which the Company does business have laws and regulations relating to the siting, construction, permitting, ownership, operation, modification, repair and decommissioning of, and power sales from electric power generation or distribution assets. In addition, international projects funded by the International Finance Corporation, the private sector lending arm of the World Bank, or many other international lenders are subject to World Bank environmental standards or similar standards, which tend to be more stringent than local country standards. The Company often has used advanced generation technologies in order to minimize environmental impacts, such as combined fluidized bed boilers and advanced gas turbines, and environmental control devices such as flue gas desulphurization for SO2 emissions and selective catalytic reduction for NOx emissions.

Environmental laws and regulations affecting electric power generation and distribution facilities are complex, change frequently and have become more stringent over time. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur capital costs and other expenditures to comply with these environmental laws and regulations. The Company may be required to make significant capital or other expenditures to comply with these regulations. There can be no assurance that the businesses operated by the subsidiaries of the Company will be able to recover any of these compliance costs from their counterparties or customers such that the Company's consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would not be materially affected.

Various licenses, permits and approvals are required for our operations. Failure to comply with permits or approvals, or with environmental laws, can result in fines, penalties, capital expenditures, interruptions or changes to our operations. Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject to litigation or regulatory action relating to environmental permits or approvals. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action.

United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations

In the United States, the CAA and various state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants, including SO2, NOX, particulate matter, GHGs, mercury and other hazardous air pollutants. Certain applicable rules are discussed in further detail below.

CSAPR — CSAPR addresses the "good neighbor" provision of the CAA, which prohibits sources within each state from emitting any air pollutant in an amount which will contribute significantly to any other state’s nonattainment, or interference with maintenance of, any NAAQS. The CSAPR required significant reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions from power plants in many states in which subsidiaries of the Company operate. The Company is required to comply with the CSAPR in several states, including Ohio, Indiana and Maryland. The CSAPR is implemented, in part, through a market-based program under which compliance may be achievable through the acquisition and use of emissions allowances created by the EPA. The Company complies with CSAPR through operation of existing controls and purchases of allowances on the open market, as needed. 

 On October 26, 2016, the EPA published a final rule to update the CSAPR to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS ("CSAPR Update Rule"). The CSAPR Update Rule finds that NOx ozone season emissions in 22 states (including Indiana, Maryland and Ohio) affect the ability of downwind states to attain and maintain the 2008 ozone NAAQS, and, accordingly, the EPA issued federal implementation plans that both updated existing CSAPR NOx ozone season emission budgets for electric generating units within these states and implemented these budgets through modifications to the CSAPR NOx ozone season allowance trading program. Implementation started in the 2017 ozone season (May-September 2017). Affected facilities began to receive fewer ozone season NOx allowances in 2017, resulting in the need to purchase additional allowances. Additionally, on September 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit remanded a portion of October 2016 CSAPR Update Rule to EPA. While the Company's additional CSAPR compliance costs to date have been immaterial, the future availability of and cost to purchase allowances to meet the emission reduction requirements is uncertain at this time, but it could be material if certain facilities will need to purchase additional allowances based on reduced allocations.

New Source Review ("NSR") — The NSR requirements under the CAA impose certain requirements on major emission sources, such as electric generating stations, if changes are made to the sources that result in a significant increase in air emissions. Certain projects, including power plant modifications, are excluded from these NSR requirements, if they meet the RMRR exclusion of the CAA. There is ongoing uncertainty, and significant litigation, regarding which projects fall within the RMRR exclusion. Over the past several years, the EPA has filed suits against coal-fired power plant owners and issued NOVs to a number of power plant owners alleging NSR violations. See Item 3.—Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K for more detail with respect to environmental litigation and regulatory action, including an NOV issued by the EPA against IPL concerning NSR and prevention of significant deterioration issues under the CAA. 

If NSR requirements are imposed on any of the power plants owned by the Company's subsidiaries, the results could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Regional Haze Rule — The EPA's "Regional Haze Rule" is intended to reduce haze and protect visibility in designated federal areas, and sets guidelines for determining BART at affected plants and how to demonstrate "reasonable progress" toward eliminating man-made haze by 2064. The Regional Haze Rule required states to consider five factors when establishing BART for sources, including the availability of emission controls, the cost of the controls and the effect of reducing emission on visibility in Class I areas (including wilderness areas, national parks and similar areas). The statute would require compliance within five years after the EPA approves the relevant SIP or issues a federal implementation plan, although individual states may impose more stringent compliance schedules. In September 2017, the EPA published a final rule affirming the continued validity of the EPA's previous determination allowing states to rely on the CSAPR to satisfy BART requirements. All of the Company’s facilities that are subject to BART comply by meeting the requirements of CSAPR.

The second phase of the Regional Haze Rule began in 2019. States must submit regional haze plans for this second implementation period in 2021 to demonstrate reasonable progress towards reducing visibility impairment in Class I areas. States may need to require additional emissions controls for visibility impairing pollutants, including on BART sources, during the second implementation period. We currently cannot predict the impact of this second implementation period, if any, on any of our Company’s U.S. subsidiaries.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS") — Under the CAA, the EPA sets NAAQS for six principal 

45 | 2019 Annual Report

pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment, including ozone, particulate matter, NOx and SO2, which result from coal combustion. Areas meeting the NAAQS are designated "attainment areas" while those that do not meet the NAAQS are considered "nonattainment areas." Each state must develop a plan to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS, which may include imposing operating limits on individual plants. The EPA is required to review NAAQS at five-year intervals.

Based on the current and potential future ambient air standards, certain of the states in which the Company's subsidiaries operate have determined or will be required to determine whether certain areas within such states meet the NAAQS. Some of these states may be required to modify their State Implementation Plans to detail how the states will attain or maintain their attainment status. As part of this process, it is possible that the applicable state environmental regulatory agency or the EPA may require reductions of emissions from our generating stations to reach attainment status for ozone, fine particulate matter, NOx or SO2. The compliance costs of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries could be material.

Beginning January 1, 2017, IPL Petersburg has been required to meet reduced SO2 limits established in a final rule published by IDEM in 2015 in accordance with a new one-hour SO2 NAAQS of 75 parts per billion. Improvements to the existing FGD systems at IPL’s Petersburg station were required to meet the emission limits imposed by the rule. The IURC approved IPL’s request for NAAQS SO2 compliance at its Petersburg generation station with 80% of qualifying costs recovered through a rate adjustment mechanism and the remainder recorded as a regulatory asset for recovery in a subsequent rate case. The approved capital cost of the NAAQS SO2 compliance plan is approximately $29 million. On August 15, 2018, the EPA proposed to approve Indiana’s State Implementation Plan addressing attainment of the 2010 SO2 standard for certain locations including those of IPL's Petersburg Generating Stations.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions — In January 2011, the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources, including pre-construction permitting program for certain new construction or major modifications, known as the PSD. If future modifications to our U.S.-based businesses' sources become subject to PSD for other pollutants, it may trigger GHG BACT requirements and the cost of compliance with such requirements may be material.

On October 23, 2015, the EPA's rule establishing NSPS for new electric generating units became effective establishing CO2 emissions standards for newly constructed coal-fueled electric generating plants, which reflects the partial capture and storage of CO2 emissions from the plants. The EPA also promulgated NSPS applicable to modified and reconstructed electric generating units, which will serve as a floor for future BACT determinations for such units. The NSPS could have an impact on the Company's plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations. On December 20, 2018, the EPA published proposed revisions to the final NSPS for new, modified and reconstructed coal-fired electric utility steam generating units proposing that the Best System of Emissions Reduction for these units is highly efficient generation that would be equivalent to supercritical steam conditions for larger units and sub-critical steam conditions for smaller units, and not partial carbon capture and sequestration, as was finalized in the 2015 final NSPS. The EPA did not include revisions for natural-gas combined cycle or simple cycle units in the December 20, 2018 proposal. Challenges to the GHG NSPS are being held in abeyance at this time. 

On October 23, 2015, the EPA finalized CO2 emission rules for existing power plants under Clean Air Act Section 111(d) (called the CPP). The CPP provided for interim emissions performance rates that must be achieved beginning in 2022 and final emissions performance rates that must be achieved starting in 2030. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued orders staying implementation of the CPP pending resolution of challenges to the rule. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published a final rule to repeal the CPP. On August 31, 2018, the EPA published in the Federal Register proposed Emission Guidelines for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Existing Electric Utility Generating Units, known as the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule. In addition, the EPA proposed associated revisions to implementing regulations and the New Source Review program. On July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE Rule along with associated revisions to implementing regulations. The final ACE Rule replaces the CPP and determines that heat rate improvement measures are the Best System of Emissions Reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units, including units at IPL Petersburg in Indiana and AES Warrior Run in Maryland. On September 17, 2019, the D.C. Circuit granted motions to dismiss as moot legal challenges to the CPP and challenges to EPA's denial of reconsideration of the CPP. The final ACE rule requires that the State of Indiana and the State of Maryland, respectively, develop a State Plan to establish CO2 emission limits for designated facilities, within three years. Impacts remain largely uncertain pending the development of the State Plans.

46 | 2019 Annual Report

On November 4, 2019, the U.S. announced that it had officially notified the U.N. that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The U.S. will officially be able to withdraw on November 4, 2020. As such, there is some uncertainty with respect to the impact of GHG rules on IPL. The GHG BACT requirements will not apply at least until we construct a new major source or make a major modification of an existing major source, and the NSPS will not require us to comply with an emissions standard until we construct a new electric generating unit. We do not have any planned major modifications of an existing source or plans to construct a new major source at this time which are expected to be subject to these regulations. Furthermore, the EPA, states and other utilities are still evaluating potential impacts of the GHG regulations in our industry. In light of these uncertainties, we cannot predict the impact of the EPA’s current and future GHG regulations on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition, but it could be material.

Due to the future uncertainty of these regulations and associated litigation, we cannot at this time determine the impact on our operations or consolidated financial results, but we believe the cost to comply with the ACE, should it be upheld and implemented in its current or a substantially similar form, could be material. The GHG NSPS remains in effect at this time, and, absent further action from the EPA that rescinds or substantively revises the NSPS, it could impact any Company plans to construct and/or modify or reconstruct electric generating units in some locations, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Cooling Water Intake — The Company's facilities are subject to a variety of rules governing water use and discharge. In particular, the Company's U.S. facilities are subject to the CWA Section 316(b) rule issued by the EPA that seeks to protect fish and other aquatic organisms by requiring existing steam electric generating facilities to utilize the BTA for cooling water intake structures. On August 15, 2014, the EPA published its final standards to protect fish and other aquatic organisms drawn into cooling water systems at large power plants. These standards require certain subject facilities to choose among seven BTA options to reduce fish impingement. In addition, facilities that withdraw at least 125 million gallons per day for cooling purposes must conduct studies to assist permitting authorities to determine which site-specific controls, if any, are required to reduce entrainment. It is possible that this decision-making process, which includes permitting and public input, could result in the need to install closed-cycle cooling systems (closed-cycle cooling towers), or other technology. Finally, the standards require that new units added to an existing facility to increase generation capacity are required to reduce both impingement and entrainment. It is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material.

AES Southland's current plan is to comply with the SWRCB OTC Policy by shutting down and permanently retiring all existing generating units at AES Alamitos, AES Huntington Beach and AES Redondo Beach that utilize OTC by December 31, 2020, the compliance date included in the OTC Policy. New air-cooled combined cycle gas turbine generators and battery energy storage systems will be constructed at the AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach generating stations, and there is currently no plan to replace the OTC generating units at the AES Redondo Beach generating station. The execution of the implementation plan for compliance with the SWRCB's OTC Policy is entirely dependent on the Company's ability to execute on long-term power purchase agreements to support project financing of the replacement generating units at AES Alamitos and AES Huntington Beach. The SWRCB is currently reviewing the implementation plan and latest information on OTC generating unit retirement dates and new generation availability to evaluate the impact on electrical system reliability, which could result in the extension of OTC compliance dates for specific units. 

The Company’s California subsidiaries have signed 20-year term power purchase agreements with Southern California Edison for the new generating capacity which have been approved by the California Public Utilities Commission. Construction of new generating capacity began in June 2017 at AES Huntington Beach and July 2017 at AES Alamitos. Construction at both sites is on schedule and required the following OTC units to retire earlier than December 31, 2020 to provide interconnection capacity and/or emissions credits prior to startup of the new generating units:

•Redondo Beach Unit 7 - September 30, 2019

•Huntington Beach Unit 1 - December 31, 2019

•Alamitos Units 1, 2, and 6 - December 31, 2019

The remaining AES OTC generating units in California will be shutdown and permanently retired by December 31, 2020 unless the SWRCB extends the OTC Policy compliance date for these units to maintain electrical system reliability. On January 23, 2020 the Statewide Advisory Committee on Cooling Water Intake Structures (SACCWIS) 

47 | 2019 Annual Report

adopted a recommendation to present to the SWRCB to extend the OTC compliance dates for AES Huntington Beach and AES Alamitos until December 31, 2023 and AES Redondo Beach until December 31, 2021. The SWRCB is expected to act on the SACCWIS recommendation in the summer of 2020.

Power plants are required to comply with the more stringent of state or federal requirements. At present, the California state requirements are more stringent and have earlier compliance dates than the federal EPA requirements, and are therefore applicable to the Company's California assets. 

Challenges to the federal EPA's rule were filed and consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, although implementation of the rule was not stayed while the challenges proceeded. On July 23, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the rule. The Second Circuit later denied a petition by environmental groups for rehearing. The Company anticipates that compliance with CWA Section 316(b) regulations and associated costs could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Water Discharges — On June 29, 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("the agencies") published a final rule defining federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States. This rule, which initially became effective on August 28, 2015, could expand or otherwise change the number and types of waters or features subject to federal permitting. However, the agencies engaged in a two-step process to repeal the 2015 "Waters of the U.S." rule and replace it with a newly promulgated rule called the "Navigable Waters Protection" rule. The agencies completed the first step on October 22, 2019 by publishing the final rule repealing the 2015 “Waters of the United States” rule. In step two, the agencies proposed a revised definition of waters of the United States on December 11, 2018 and released the prepublication version of the final "Navigable Waters Protection" rule on January 23, 2020. It is too early to determine whether the newly promulgated "Navigable Waters Protection" rule may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Certain of the Company's U.S.-based businesses are subject to National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permits that regulate specific industrial waste water and storm water discharges to the waters of the United States under the CWA. 

On August 28, 2012, the IDEM issued NPDES permits that set new water quality-based effluent discharge limits for the IPL Harding Street and Petersburg facilities with full compliance ultimately required by September 29, 2017. The deadline for Petersburg to commission a portion of the treatment system was subsequently extended to April 11, 2018.

On November 3, 2015, the EPA published its final ELG rule to reduce toxic pollutants discharged into waters of the U.S. by steam-electric power plants through technology applications. These effluent limitations for existing and new sources include dry handling of fly ash, closed-loop or dry handling of bottom ash and more stringent effluent limitations for flue gas de-sulfurization wastewater. The required compliance time lines for existing sources was to be established between November 1, 2018 and December 31, 2023. On September 18, 2017, the EPA published a final rule delaying certain compliance dates of the ELG rule for two years while it administratively reconsiders the rule. IPL Petersburg has installed a dry bottom ash handling system in response to the CCR rule described below and wastewater treatment systems in response to the NPDES permits described above in advance of the ELG compliance date. Other U.S. businesses already include dry handling of fly ash and bottom ash and do not generate flue gas de-sulfurization wastewater. On April 12, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated and remanded portions of the EPA's 2015 ELG Rule related to legacy wastewaters and combustions residual leachate. On November 22, 2019, the EPA published proposed revisions to the ELG rule specifically for flue gas desulfurization wastewater and bottom ash transport water. It is too early to determine whether the outcome of the decision or current or future revisions to the ELG rule might have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Selenium Rule — In June 2016, the EPA published the final national chronic aquatic life criterion for the pollutant Selenium in fresh water. NPDES permits may be updated to include Selenium water quality based effluent limits based on a site-specific evaluation process which includes determining if there is a reasonable potential to exceed the revised final Selenium water quality standards for the specific receiving water body utilizing actual and/or project discharge information for the generating facilities. As a result, it is not yet possible to predict the total impacts of this final rule at this time, including any challenges to such final rule and the outcome of any such challenges. However, if additional capital expenditures are necessary, they could be material. IPL would seek recovery of these capital expenditures; however, there is no guarantee it would be successful in this regard.

Waste Management — In the course of operations, the Company's facilities generate solid and liquid waste materials requiring eventual disposal or processing. With the exception of coal combustion residuals ("CCR"), the 

48 | 2019 Annual Report

wastes are not usually physically disposed of on our property, but are shipped off site for final disposal, treatment or recycling. CCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes, is disposed of at some of our coal-fired power generation plant sites using engineered, permitted landfills. Waste materials generated at our electric power and distribution facilities may include asbestos, CCR, oil, scrap metal, rubbish, small quantities of industrial hazardous wastes such as spent solvents, tree and land clearing wastes and polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated liquids and solids. The Company endeavors to ensure that all of its solid and liquid wastes are disposed of in accordance with applicable national, regional, state and local regulations. On October 19, 2015, an EPA rule regulating CCR under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as nonhazardous solid waste became effective. The rule established nationally applicable minimum criteria for the disposal of CCR in new and currently operating landfills and surface impoundments, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation would be actions commenced by the states and private lawsuits. On December 16, 2016, the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act ("WIN Act") was signed into law. This includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. The EPA has indicated that it will implement a phased approach to amending the CCR Rule. In July 2018, the EPA published final CCR Rule Amendments (Phase One, Part One) in the Federal Register. In August 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued a decision in certain CCR litigation matters, which may result in additional revisions to the CCR rule. In October 2018, some environmental groups filed a Petition for Review challenging EPA's final CCR rule amendments (Phase One, Part One) which have since been remanded without vacatur to the EPA. On August 14, 2019, the EPA published the amendments to the CCR rule; the amendments relate to the CCR rule's criteria for determining beneficial use and the regulation of CCR piles, among other revisions. On December 2, 2019, the EPA published additional proposed amendments to the CCR rule titled "A Holistic Approach to Closure Part A: Deadline to Initiate Closure". On December 19, 2019, the EPA issued a prepublication version of a proposed rule to establish a federal CCR permit program that would operate in states without approved CCR permit programs. If this rule is finalized before Indiana or Puerto Rico establishes a state-level CCR permit program, AES CCR units in those locations could eventually be required to apply for a federal CCR permit from EPA.

The CCR rule, current or proposed amendments to the CCR rule, the results of groundwater monitoring data or the outcome of CCR-related litigation could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. IPL would seek recovery of any resulting expenditures; however, there is no guarantee we would be successful in this regard.

On January 2, 2020, Puerto Rico Senate Bill 1221 was signed by the Puerto Rico Governor into law and became effective as Act 5-2020. Act 5-2020 prohibits the disposal and unencapsulated beneficial use of CCR, places restrictions on storage of CCR in Puerto Rico, and requires the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources to develop implementation regulations. As such, it is not yet possible to determine whether this might have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 — This act, also known as "Superfund," may be the source of claims against certain of the Company's U.S. subsidiaries from time to time. There is ongoing litigation at a site known as the South Dayton Landfill where a group of companies already recognized as potentially responsible parties ("PRPs") have sued DP&L and other unrelated entities seeking a contribution toward the costs of assessment and remediation. DP&L is actively opposing such claims. In 2003, DP&L received notice that the EPA considers DP&L to be a potentially responsible party at the Tremont City landfill Superfund site. The EPA has taken no further action with respect to DP&L since 2003 regarding the Tremont City landfill. On October 16, 2019, DP&L received a special notice that the EPA considers DP&L, along with other parties, to be a PRP for the clean-up of hazardous substances at a third-party landfill known as the Tremont City Barrel Site, located near Dayton, Ohio. The Company is unable to determine whether there will be any liability, or the size of any liability that may ultimately be assessed against DP&L at these three sites, but any such liability could be material to DP&L.
