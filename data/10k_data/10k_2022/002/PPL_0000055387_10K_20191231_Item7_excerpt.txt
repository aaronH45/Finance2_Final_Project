Business Strategy

(All Registrants)

PPL operates seven fully regulated high-performing utilities. These utilities are located in the U.K., Pennsylvania and Kentucky, constructive regulatory jurisdictions with distinct regulatory structures and customer classes. PPL believes this business portfolio positions the company well for continued success and provides earnings and dividend growth potential.

PPL's strategy, and that of the other Registrants, is to deliver best-in-sector operational performance, invest in a sustainable energy future, maintain a strong financial foundation, and engage and develop its people. PPL's business plan is designed to achieve growth by providing efficient, reliable and safe operations and strong customer service, maintaining constructive regulatory relationships and achieving timely recovery of costs. These businesses are expected to achieve strong, long-term 

34
growth in rate base in the U.S. and RAV in the U.K. Rate base growth is being driven by planned significant capital expenditures to maintain existing assets and improve system reliability and, for LKE, LG&E and KU, to comply with federal and state environmental regulations related to coal-fired electricity generation facilities.

For the U.S. businesses, central to PPL's strategy is recovering capital project costs efficiently through various rate-making mechanisms, including periodic base rate case proceedings using forward test years, annual FERC formula rate mechanisms and other regulatory agency-approved recovery mechanisms designed to limit regulatory lag. In Kentucky, the KPSC has adopted a series of regulatory mechanisms (ECR, DSM, GLT, fuel adjustment clause and gas supply clause) and recovery on construction work-in-progress that reduce regulatory lag and provide timely recovery of and return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs. In addition, the KPSC requires a utility to obtain a CPCN prior to constructing a facility, unless the construction is an ordinary extension of existing facilities in the usual course of business or does not involve sufficient capital expenditures to materially affect the utility's financial condition. Although such KPSC proceedings do not directly address cost recovery issues, the KPSC, in awarding a CPCN, concludes that the public convenience and necessity require the construction of the facility on the basis that the facility is the lowest reasonable cost alternative to address the need. In Pennsylvania, the FERC transmission formula rate, DSIC mechanism, Smart Meter Rider and other recovery mechanisms are in place to reduce regulatory lag and provide for timely recovery of and a return on, as appropriate, prudently incurred costs.

To manage financing costs and access to credit markets, and to fund capital expenditures, a key objective of the Registrants is to maintain their investment grade credit ratings and adequate liquidity positions. In addition, the Registrants have financial and operational risk management programs that, among other things, are designed to monitor and manage exposure to earnings and cash flow volatility, as applicable, related to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and counterparty credit quality. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and swaps. See "Financial Condition - Risk Management" below for further information. 

Earnings generated by PPL's U.K. subsidiaries are subject to foreign currency translation risk. Because WPD's earnings represent such a significant portion of PPL's consolidated earnings, PPL enters into foreign currency contracts to economically hedge the value of the GBP versus the U.S. dollar. These hedges do not receive hedge accounting treatment under GAAP. See "Financial and Operational Developments - U.K. Membership in European Union" for additional discussion of the U.K. earnings hedging activity.

The U.K. subsidiaries also have currency exposure to the U.S. dollar to the extent of their U.S. dollar denominated debt. To manage these risks, PPL generally uses contracts such as forwards, options and cross-currency swaps that contain characteristics of both interest rate and foreign currency exchange contracts.

As discussed above, a key component of this strategy is to maintain constructive relationships with regulators in all jurisdictions in which the Registrants operate (U.K., U.S. federal and state). This is supported by a strong culture of integrity and delivering on commitments to customers, regulators and shareowners, and a commitment to continue to improve customer service, reliability and operational efficiency.

Financial and Operational Developments

U.S. Tax Reform (All Registrants)

The IRS issued proposed regulations for certain provisions of the TCJA in 2018, including interest deductibility and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI). In 2019, final and new proposed regulations were issued relating to the GILTI provisions. PPL has determined that neither the final or new proposed regulations materially change PPL's conclusion that currently no incremental tax arises under these rules. Proposed regulations relating to the limitation on the deductibility of interest expense were issued in November 2018 and such regulations provide detailed rules implementing the broader statutory provisions. These proposed regulations should not apply to the Registrants until the year in which the regulations are issued in final form, which is expected to be in 2020. It is uncertain what form the final regulations will take and, therefore, the Registrants cannot predict what impact the final regulations will have on the tax deductibility of interest expense. However, if the proposed regulations were issued as final in their current form, the Registrants could have a limitation on a portion of their interest expense deduction for tax purposes and such limitation could be significant. PPL expressed its views on these proposed regulations in a comment letter addressed to the IRS on February 26, 2019. 

U.K. Membership in European Union (PPL) 

Following the June 2016 referendum, on March 29, 2017, the U.K. Government invoked Article 50 (Article 50) of the Lisbon Treaty, formally beginning the two-year period provided by Article 50 for the U.K. to negotiate an agreement specifying the 

35
terms of its withdrawal from the European Union (EU), popularly referred to as Brexit. After repeated extensions, on October 28, 2019, the EU agreed to extend the Article 50 process until January 31, 2020. The U.K. Parliament subsequently approved an early general election for December 12, 2019, which resulted in a substantial Conservative Party Parliamentary majority and subsequent U.K. and EU Parliamentary votes to approve the EU withdrawal agreement negotiated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

The U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020 with agreed upon withdrawal terms, entering a transition period that is scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the U.K. will seek to negotiate a free trade arrangement with the EU and also negotiate new trade terms with countries outside of the EU. Significant uncertainty continues to surround the outcome of the transition period. PPL believes that its greatest risk related to the remaining Brexit uncertainties is an extended period of depressed value of the GBP or the potential further decline in the value of the GBP compared to the U.S. dollar. A decline in the value of the GBP compared to the U.S. dollar will reduce the value of WPD's earnings to PPL.

PPL has executed hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk to its U.K. earnings. As of January 31, 2020, PPL's foreign exchange exposure related to budgeted earnings is 90% hedged for 2020 at an average rate of $1.48 per GBP and 5% hedged for 2021 at an average rate of $1.33 per GBP.

PPL cannot predict the impact, in either the short-term or long-term, on foreign exchange rates or PPL's financial condition that may be experienced as a result of the actions taken by the U.K. government to withdraw from the EU, although such impacts could be material.

PPL does not expect the financial condition and results of operations of WPD, itself, to change significantly as a result of Brexit. The regulatory environment and operation of WPD's businesses are not expected to change. RIIO-ED1, the current price control, with allowed revenues agreed with Ofgem runs through March 2023. The impact of a slower economy or recession on WPD would be mitigated in part because U.K. regulation provides that any reduction in the volume of electricity delivered will be recovered in allowed revenues in future periods through the K-factor adjustment. See "Item 1. Business - Segment Information - U.K. Regulated Segment" for additional information on the current price control and K-factor adjustment. In addition, an increase in inflation would have a positive effect on revenues and RAV as annual inflation adjustments are applied to both revenues and RAV (and real returns are earned on inflated RAV). This impact, however, would be partially offset by higher operation and maintenance and interest expense on index-linked debt. With respect to access to financing, WPD has substantial borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and expects to continue to have access to all major financial markets. With respect to access to and cost of equipment and other materials, WPD management continues to review U.K. government issued advice on preparations for Brexit and has taken actions to mitigate potential increasing costs and disruption to its critical sources of supply. Additionally, less than 1% of WPD's employees are non-U.K. EU nationals and no change in their domicile is expected.

Regulatory Requirements

(All Registrants)

The Registrants cannot predict the impact that future regulatory requirements may have on their financial condition or results of operations.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

The businesses of LKE, LG&E and KU are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those pertaining to CCRs, GHG, and ELGs. See "Item 1. Business" and Notes 7, 13 and 19 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these significant environmental matters. These and other environmental requirements led PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU to retire approximately 1,000 MW of coal-fired generating plants in Kentucky since 2015.

TCJA Impact on FERC Rates (All Registrants)

In November 2019, the FERC published Final Rules providing that public utility transmission providers include mechanisms in their formula rates to deduct excess ADIT from, or add deficient ADIT to, rate base and adjust their income tax allowances by amortized excess or deficient ADIT, and to make a related compliance filing.

In February 2019, PPL Electric filed with the FERC proposed revisions to its transmission formula rate template pursuant to Section 205 of the Federal Power Act and Section 35.13 of the FERC Rules and Regulations. Specifically, PPL Electric proposed to modify its formula rate to permit the return or recovery of excess or deficient ADIT resulting from the TCJA and 

36
permit PPL Electric to prospectively account for the income tax expense associated with the depreciation of the equity component of the AFUDC. In April 2019, the FERC accepted the proposed revisions to the formula rate template, which were effective June 1, 2019, as well as the proposed adjustments to ADIT, effective January 1, 2018. 

In February 2019, in connection with the requirements of the TCJA and Kentucky HB 487, LG&E and KU filed a request with the FERC to amend their transmission formula rates resulting from the laws’ reductions to corporate income tax rates. The FERC approved this request effective June 1, 2019. LG&E and KU are currently reviewing the Final Rule and will submit a compliance filing addressing excess ADIT by June 1, 2020. LG&E and KU do not anticipate the impact of the TCJA and Kentucky HB 487 related to their FERC-jurisdictional rates to be significant.  

Pennsylvania Alternative Ratemaking (PPL and PPL Electric)

In June 2018, Governor Tom Wolf signed into law Act 58 of 2018 (codified at 66 Pa. C.S. § 1330) authorizing public utilities to implement alternative rates and rate mechanisms in base rate proceedings before the PUC. The effective date of Act 58 was August 27, 2018. Under the new law, a public utility may file an application to establish alternative rates and rate mechanisms in a base rate proceeding. These alternative rates and rate mechanisms include, but are not limited to, decoupling mechanisms, performance-based rates, formula rates, multi-year rate plans, or a combination of those or other mechanisms.

On April 25, 2019, the PUC issued an Implementation Order adopting its interpretation and implementation of Act 58 and establishing the procedures through which utilities may seek PUC approval of alternative rates and rate mechanisms.

RIIO-2 Framework (PPL)

In 2018, Ofgem issued its consultation document on the RIIO-2 framework, covering all U.K. gas and electricity transmission and distribution price controls. The current electricity distribution price control, RIIO-ED1, continues through March 31, 2023 and will not be impacted by the RIIO-2 consultation process. Later in 2018, Ofgem published its decision following its RIIO-2 framework consultation after consideration of comments received including those from WPD and PPL.

In August 2019, Ofgem published an open letter seeking views on its proposed sector specific approach on the RIIO-ED2 framework. WPD and PPL provided responses to this open letter. In December 2019, Ofgem published its decision on the RIIO-ED2 framework, thus confirming the following points in its RIIO-2 and RIIO-ED2 framework decision documents:

•RIIO-ED2 will be a five-year price control period, compared to eight years in the current RIIO-ED1 price control. 

•CPI or CPIH will be used for inflation measurement in calculating both RAV and allowed returns rather than RPI.

•The baseline allowed return on equity will be set using the same methodology in all RIIO-2 sectors. The new methodology includes; (a) an equity indexation, whereby the allowed return on equity is updated to reflect changes in the risk-free rate, and (b) potentially setting the allowed return 0.5% below the expected return.

•Full debt indexation will be retained.

•The early settlement process (fast tracking) will be removed and replaced with an alternative mechanism to incentivize high-quality, rigorous and ambitious business plans.

•The Totex incentive rate will be based on a confidence level for setting baseline cost allowances.

•A new enhanced engagement model will be introduced requiring distribution companies to set up a customer engagement group to provide Ofgem with a public report of local stakeholders’ views on the companies’ business plans. Ofgem will also establish an independent RIIO-2 challenge group comprised of consumer experts to provide Ofgem with a public report on companies’ business plans.

•There will be no change to the existing depreciation policy of using economic asset lives as the basis for depreciating RAV as part of base revenue calculations. WPD is currently transitioning to 45-year asset lives for new additions in RIIO-ED1 based on Ofgem’s extensive review of asset lives in RIIO-ED1.

•A focus of RIIO-2 will be on whole-system outcomes. Ofgem intends network companies and system operators working together to ensure the energy system as a whole is efficient and delivers the best value to consumers. Ofgem is undertaking further work to clarify the definition of whole-system and the appropriate roles of the network companies in supporting this objective. Ofgem is still undecided on how DSO functions are to be treated. Ofgem will include a DSO reopener to reassess progress made in the establishment of DSO activities.

37
Ofgem will now shift focus to the development of the RIIO-ED2 price control methodology, with the consultation expected to be published by the third quarter of 2020. WPD and PPL continue to be fully engaged in the RIIO-ED2 process. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this process or the long-term impact the final RIIO-ED2 price control will have on its financial condition or results of operations. Any decision for RIIO-ED2 will not be finalized until November 2022. The RIIO-ED2 price control will come into effect on April 1, 2023.

FERC Transmission Rate Filing

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

In 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application seeks termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky Municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. Due to the development of robust, accessible energy markets over time, LG&E and KU believe the mitigation commitments are no longer relevant or appropriate. In March 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the on-going credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, subject to FERC review and approval. In July 2019, LG&E and KU proposed their transition mechanism to the FERC and in September 2019, the FERC rejected the proposed transition mechanism and issued a separate order providing clarifications of certain aspects of the March order. In October 2019, LG&E and KU filed requests for rehearing and clarification on the two September orders. These rehearing requests are currently pending before FERC. Additionally, certain petitions for review of FERC's orders have been filed by multiple parties, including LG&E and KU, at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of the proceedings. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of waivers and credits provided through other rate mechanisms.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In April 2019, PPL Electric filed its annual transmission formula rate update with the FERC, reflecting a revised revenue requirement, which includes the impact of the TCJA. The filing established the revenue requirement used to set rates that took effect in June 2019.

Rate Case Proceedings 

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

In September 2018, LG&E and KU filed requests with the KPSC for an increase in annual base electricity rates and gas rates and the elimination of the TCJA bill credit mechanism. In April 2019, the KPSC issued orders eliminating the TCJA bill credit mechanism and increasing annual base electricity and gas rates providing for an annual revenue increase of $187 million ($114 million at KU and $73 million at LG&E), based on a 9.725% return-on-equity. The new base rates and all elements of the orders became effective May 1, 2019. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(KU)

In July 2019, KU filed a request with the VSCC for an increase in annual Virginia base electricity revenues of approximately $13 million, representing an increase of 18.2%. In January 2020, KU reached a partial settlement agreement including an increase in annual Virginia base electricity revenues of $9 million effective May 1, 2020, representing an increase of 12.9%. A hearing on the settlement of remaining issues was held in January 2020. A VSCC ruling in the proceeding is expected in April 2020. 

Distribution of TCJA Savings

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In November 2019, the PUC approved PPL Electric's October 2019 petition to distribute the $43 million of TCJA tax savings for the period between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018 over the period January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020.

Results of Operations

(PPL)

The "Statement of Income Analysis" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on PPL's Statements of Income, comparing 2019 with 2018. The "Segment Earnings" and "Adjusted Gross Margins" discussions for PPL provide a review of results by reportable segment. These discussions include non-GAAP financial measures, including "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" and "Adjusted Gross Margins," and provide explanations of the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of those measures to the most comparable GAAP measure. The "2020 Outlook" discussion identifies key factors expected to impact 2020 earnings.

Tables analyzing changes in amounts between periods within "Statement of Income Analysis," "Segment Earnings" and "Adjusted Gross Margins" are presented on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis, where applicable, in order to isolate the impact of the change in the exchange rate on the item being explained. Results computed on a constant GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate basis are calculated by translating current year results at the prior year weighted-average GBP to U.S. dollar exchange rate.

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

A "Statement of Income Analysis" is presented separately for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. The "Statement of Income Analysis" discussion below describes significant changes in principal line items on the Statements of Income, comparing 2019 with 2018. The results of operations section for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instructions (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K. 

PPL: Statement of Income Analysis, Segment Earnings and Adjusted Gross Margins

Statement of Income Analysis

Net income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

39
Operating Revenues

The increase (decrease) in operating revenues was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The increase was primarily due to reconcilable cost recovery mechanisms approved by the PUC.

(b)The increase was primarily due to $77 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments partially offset by a $27 million unfavorable impact of the TCJA, which reduced the new revenue requirement that went into effect June 1, 2018.

(c)The decrease was due to the estimated income tax savings owed to or already returned to distribution customers related to the reduced U.S federal corporate income taxes as a result of the TCJA. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(d)The increase was primarily due to higher base rates, inclusive of the termination of the TCJA bill credit mechanism, effective May 1, 2019.

(e)The increase was primarily due to higher returns on additional environmental capital investments and higher recoverable depreciation expense as a result of higher depreciation rates effective May 1, 2019.

(f)The decrease was primarily due to weather.

(g)The decrease was primarily due to the termination of eight supply contracts with Kentucky municipalities on April 30, 2019.

(h)The decrease was primarily due to lower recoveries of fuel and energy purchases due to lower commodity costs. 

Fuel

Fuel decreased $90 million in 2019 compared with 2018 at LKE, primarily due to a $42 million decrease in commodity costs, a $33 million decrease in volumes driven by weather and a $20 million decrease in volumes driven by the termination of eight supply contracts with Kentucky municipalities on April 30, 2019.

Energy Purchases

Energy purchases decreased $22 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to a $27 million decrease at LKE (primarily due to a $14 million decrease in commodity costs and a $7 million decrease in gas volumes driven by weather in 2019), partially offset by a $5 million increase at PPL Electric (primarily due to higher PLR volumes of $33 million, partially offset by lower PLR prices of $25 million).

40
Other Operation and Maintenance

The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The increase is primarily due to 2019 including a full year of other operation and maintenance expense of Safari Energy, which was acquired on June 1, 2018.

Depreciation

The increase (decrease) in depreciation was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Higher depreciation rates were effective May 1, 2019 at LG&E and KU.

Other Income (Expense) - net

The increase (decrease) in other income (expense) - net was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interest Expense

The increase (decrease) in interest expense was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

41
Income Taxes

The increase (decrease) in income taxes was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)In 2018, LKE recorded deferred income tax expense, primarily associated with LKE's non-regulated entities, due to the Kentucky corporate income tax rate reduction from 6% to 5%, as enacted by HB 487, effective January 1, 2018.

(b)In 2019, LKE recorded a deferred income tax benefit associated with two projects placed into service that prepare a generation waste material for reuse and, as a result, qualify for a Kentucky recycling credit. The applicable credit provides tax benefits for a portion of the equipment costs for major recycling projects in Kentucky. 

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.

Segment Earnings

PPL's net income by reportable segments were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Primarily represents financing and certain other costs incurred at the corporate level that have not been allocated or assigned to the segments, which are presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results. 

Earnings from Ongoing Operations

Management utilizes "Earnings from Ongoing Operations" as a non-GAAP financial measure that should not be considered as an alternative to net income, an indicator of operating performance determined in accordance with GAAP. PPL believes that Earnings from Ongoing Operations is useful and meaningful to investors because it provides management's view of PPL's earnings performance as another criterion in making investment decisions. In addition, PPL's management uses Earnings from Ongoing Operations in measuring achievement of certain corporate performance goals, including targets for certain executive incentive compensation. Other companies may use different measures to present financial performance.

Earnings from Ongoing Operations is adjusted for the impact of special items. Special items are presented in the financial tables on an after-tax basis with the related income taxes on special items separately disclosed. Income taxes on special items, when applicable, are calculated based on the statutory tax rate of the entity where the activity is recorded. Special items may include items such as:

•Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges (as discussed below).

•Gains and losses on sales of assets not in the ordinary course of business.

•Impairment charges.

•Significant workforce reduction and other restructuring effects.

•Acquisition and divestiture-related adjustments.

•Other charges or credits that are, in management's view, non-recurring or otherwise not reflective of the company's ongoing operations.

Unrealized gains or losses on foreign currency economic hedges include the changes in fair value of foreign currency contracts used to hedge GBP-denominated anticipated earnings. The changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized immediately within GAAP earnings. Management believes that excluding these amounts from Earnings from Ongoing Operations until settlement of the contracts provides a better matching of the financial impacts of those contracts with the economic value of 

42
PPL's underlying hedged earnings. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and "Risk Management" below for additional information on foreign currency economic activity.

PPL's Earnings from Ongoing Operations by reportable segment were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

See "Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations" below for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to Net Income.

U.K. Regulated Segment

The U.K. Regulated segment consists of PPL Global, which primarily includes WPD's regulated electricity distribution operations, the results of hedging the translation of WPD's earnings from GBP into U.S. dollars, and certain costs, such as U.S. income taxes, administrative costs, and certain acquisition-related financing costs. The U.K. Regulated segment represents 56% of PPL's Net Income for 2019 and 39% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2019.

Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the U.K. Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Unrealized gains (losses) on contracts that economically hedge anticipated GBP-denominated earnings. 

(b)Settlement of a contractual dispute.

(c)Adjustments to certain provisional amounts recognized in the December 31, 2017 Statement of Income related to the enactment of the TCJA.

(d)Primarily a payment related to the death of the WPD Chief Executive.

The changes in the components of the U.K. Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins, the items that management considers special and the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange, including the effects of foreign currency hedge contracts, on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.

43
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•See "Adjusted Gross Margins - Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins" for an explanation of U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins.

•Higher other income (expense) - net in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher pension income.

Kentucky Regulated Segment

The Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of LKE's regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated distribution and sale of natural gas. In addition, certain acquisition-related financing costs are allocated to the Kentucky Regulated segment. The Kentucky Regulated segment represents 25% of PPL's Net Income for 2019 and 34% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2019.

Net Income and Earnings from Ongoing Operations include the following results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following after-tax gains (losses), which management considers special items, impacted the Kentucky Regulated segment's results and are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Adjustments to certain provisional amounts recognized in the December 31, 2017 Statement of Income related to the enactment of the TCJA.

(b)In 2018, LKE recorded deferred income tax expense, primarily associated with LKE's non-regulated entities, due to the Kentucky corporate income tax rate reduction from 6% to 5%, as enacted by HB 487, effective January 1, 2018.

44
The changes in the components of the Kentucky Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins and the items that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line item.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•See "Adjusted Gross Margins - Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins" for an explanation of Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins.

•Higher depreciation expense in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to a $15 million increase related to higher depreciation rates effective May 1, 2019 and an $11 million increase related to additional assets placed into service, net of retirements.

•Higher interest expense in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to increased borrowings and higher interest rates.

•Lower income taxes in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the recording of a deferred income tax benefit related to a Kentucky recycling credit.

Pennsylvania Regulated Segment

The Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric. In addition, certain costs are allocated to the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. The Pennsylvania Regulated segment represents 26% of PPL's Net Income for 2019 and 26% of PPL's assets at December 31, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)In June 2018, PPL EU Services' IT department announced an internal reorganization, which was substantially completed in the third quarter of 2018. As a result, $5 million of after-tax costs, which includes separation benefits as well as outside services for strategic consulting to establish the new IT organization, were incurred.

The changes in the components of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's results between these periods were due to the factors set forth below, which reflect amounts classified as Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins and the items that management considers special on separate lines and not in their respective Statement of Income line items.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•See "Adjusted Gross Margins - Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins" for an explanation of Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins.

•Higher depreciation expense in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to additional assets placed into service, related to the ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability of the delivery system and the replacement of aging infrastructure, net of retirements.

Reconciliation of Earnings from Ongoing Operations

The following tables contain after-tax gains (losses), in total, which management considers special items, that are excluded from Earnings from Ongoing Operations and a reconciliation to PPL's "Net Income" for the years ended December 31:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)PPL incurred legal expenses related to litigation with its former affiliate, Talen Montana. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(b)PPL recorded adjustments to certain provisional amounts recognized in the December 31, 2017 Statement of Income relating to the enactment of the TCJA. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Adjusted Gross Margins

Management also utilizes the following non-GAAP financial measures as indicators of performance for its businesses.

•"U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity distribution operations of the U.K. Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, direct costs such as connection charges from National Grid, which owns and manages the electricity transmission network in England and Wales, and Ofgem license fees (recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues, as they are costs passed through to customers. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from the delivery of electricity across WPD's distribution network in the U.K. and directly related activities.

•"Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations of the Kentucky Regulated segment, as well as the Kentucky Regulated segment's distribution and sale of natural gas. In calculating this measure, fuel, energy purchases and certain variable costs of production (recorded in "Other operation and maintenance" on the Statements of Income) are deducted from operating revenues. In addition, certain other expenses, recorded in "Other operation and maintenance", "Depreciation" and "Taxes, other than income" on the Statements of Income, associated with approved cost recovery mechanisms are offset against the recovery of those expenses, which are included in revenues. These mechanisms allow for direct recovery of these expenses and, in some cases, returns on capital investments and performance incentives. As a result, this measure represents the net revenues from electricity and gas operations.

•"Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins" is a single financial performance measure of the electricity transmission and distribution operations of the Pennsylvania Regulated segment. In calculating this measure, utility revenues and expenses associated with approved recovery mechanisms, including energy provided as a PLR, are offset with minimal impact on earnings. Costs associated with these mechanisms are recorded in "Energy purchases," "Other operation and maintenance," (which are primarily Act 129, Storm Damage and Universal Service program costs), "Depreciation" (which is primarily related to the Act 129 Smart Meter program) and "Taxes, other than income," (which is primarily gross receipts tax) on the Statements of Income. This measure represents the net revenues from the Pennsylvania Regulated segment's electricity delivery operations.

These measures are not intended to replace "Operating Income," which is determined in accordance with GAAP, as an indicator of overall operating performance. Other companies may use different measures to analyze and report their results of operations. Management believes these measures provide additional useful criteria to make investment decisions. These performance measures are used, in conjunction with other information, by senior management and PPL's Board of Directors to manage operations and analyze actual results compared with budget.

Changes in Adjusted Gross Margins

The following table shows Adjusted Gross Margins by PPL's reportable segments and by component, as applicable, for the year ended December 31 as well as the changes between periods. The factors that gave rise to the changes are described following the table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins

U.K. Adjusted Gross Margins, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to $83 million from the April 1, 2018 and 2019 price increases, partially offset by $64 million of lower volumes.

Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins

Kentucky Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher retail rates approved by the KPSC of $123 million, inclusive of the termination of the TCJA bill credit mechanism, and higher returns on additional environmental capital investments of $21 million. These increases were partially offset by $37 million of decreased sales volumes primarily due to weather and a $32 million decrease due to the termination of eight supply contracts with Kentucky municipalities on April 30, 2019. 

Pennsylvania Adjusted Gross Margins

Distribution

Distribution Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to returns on additional distribution system improvement capital investments of $10 million and returns on additional Smart Meter capital investments of $5 million, partially offset by a $12 million net of gross receipts tax impact of the estimated income tax savings owed to customers as a result of the impact of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate reduction from 35% to 21% as enacted by the TCJA.

Transmission

Transmission Adjusted Gross Margins increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to an increase of $77 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments focused on replacing aging infrastructure and improving reliability, partially offset by $27 million from the impact of the reduced U.S. federal corporate income taxes as a result of the TCJA in the first five months of 2019.

Reconciliation of Adjusted Gross Margins

The following tables contain the components from the Statement of Income that are included in the non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation to PPL's "Operating Income" for the years ended December 31:

(PPL)

Higher net income is projected in 2020 compared with 2019. The following projections and factors underlying these projections (on an after-tax basis) are provided for PPL's segments and the Corporate and Other category and the related Registrants.

(PPL's U.K. Regulated Segment)

Higher net income is projected in 2020 compared with 2019. Excluding 2019 special items, the increase is driven primarily by higher base demand revenues and higher assumed GBP exchange rates, partially offset by lower true-up mechanisms, lower pension income and higher interest expense.

(PPL's Kentucky Regulated Segment and LKE)

Higher net income is projected in 2020 compared with 2019, driven primarily by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher income tax expense.

(LG&E)

Higher net income is projected in 2020 compared with 2019, driven primarily by higher retail rates, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.

49
(KU)

Net income is projected in 2020 to be comparable with 2019, driven primarily by higher retail rates, offset by higher depreciation expense.

(PPL's Pennsylvania Regulated Segment and PPL Electric)

Higher net income is projected in 2020 compared with 2019, driven primarily by higher returns on transmission investments and lower operation and maintenance expense, partially offset by higher depreciation expense.

(PPL's Corporate and Other Category)

Lower costs are projected in 2020 compared with 2019, driven primarily by lower expenses and other factors.

(All Registrants)

Earnings in future periods are subject to various risks and uncertainties. See "Forward-Looking Information," "Item 1. Business," "Item 1A. Risk Factors," the rest of this Item 7, and Notes 1, 7 and 13 to the Financial Statements (as applicable) for a discussion of the risks, uncertainties and factors that may impact future earnings.

PPL Electric: Statement of Income Analysis

Net income for the years ended December 31 includes the following results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Revenues

The increase (decrease) in operating revenues was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Distribution price variances were primarily due to reconcilable cost recovery mechanisms approved by the PUC.

(b)Transmission Formula Rate revenues increased primarily due to $77 million from returns on additional transmission capital investments partially offset by a $27 million unfavorable impact of the TCJA, which reduced the new revenue requirement that went into effect June 1, 2018.

(c)Represents the estimated income tax savings owed to or already returned to distribution customers related to the reduced U.S federal corporate income taxes as a result of the TCJA. See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

50
Energy Purchases

Energy purchases increased $5 million in 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher PLR volumes of $33 million, partially offset by lower PLR prices of $25 million and lower transmission enhancement expenses of $3 million.

Other Operation and Maintenance

The increase (decrease) in other operation and maintenance was due to:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation

Depreciation increased by $34 million in 2019 compared with 2018. This increase was primarily due to additional assets placed into service, related to the ongoing efforts to ensure the reliability of the delivery system and the replacement of aging infrastructure as well as the roll-out of the Act 129 Smart Meter program, net of retirements.

Interest Expense

Interest expense increased $11 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to the June 2018 issuance of $400 million of 4.15% First Mortgage Bonds due 2048 and the September 2019 issuance of $400 million of 3.00% First Mortgage Bonds due 2049.

Income Taxes

Income taxes increased $13 million in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase was primarily due to a change in pre-tax income. See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes.

55
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(PPL)

PPL cash provided by operating activities in 2019 decreased $394 million compared with 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The $451 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments), an increase in net regulatory assets and liabilities (primarily due to the impact of the TCJA and timing of recovery rate mechanisms), an increase in other current liabilities (primarily due to timing of payments and operating lease liability), an increase in unbilled revenue (primarily due to weather, higher retail rates effective May 1, 2019 and a change in pricing method in the model), an increase in fuel, materials and supplies (primarily due to inventory management) and an increase in other (primarily due to a decrease in taxes payable and a decrease in counter-party collateral partially offset by an increase in customer deposits).

•The $114 million decrease in cash provided by other operating activities was primarily due to the $65 million transfer of excess benefit funds, in 2018, related to the favorable private letter ruling received by PPL from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new sub-account within the VEBA, to be used to pay for medical claims of active bargaining unit employees, decrease in non-current regulatory liabilities (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms) and an increase in other assets (primarily due to settlement of interest rate swaps and purchase of solar panels).

(PPL Electric)

PPL Electric's cash provided by operating activities in 2019 decreased $65 million compared with 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The $90 million decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily due to an increase in net regulatory assets and liabilities (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms), an increase in unbilled revenue (primarily due to a change in pricing method in the model), an increase in other net current assets and current liabilities (primarily due to an increase in 2019 material and supplies) and an increase in accounts receivable (primarily due to timing of receipts).

•The $8 million increase in cash provided by other operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in non-current regulatory assets (due to timing of rate recovery mechanisms, amortization of storm costs incurred in the prior year and $22 million of storm costs incurred in 2018), partially offset by a decrease in non-current liabilities (primarily due to a $41 million TCJA liability in 2018).

56
(LKE) 

LKE had a $23 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared with 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The decrease in cash from changes in working capital was primarily driven by an increase in net regulatory assets and liabilities (primarily due to the impact of the TCJA and timing of rate recovery mechanisms), a decrease in accounts payable (primarily due to timing of payments) and an increase in unbilled revenues (primarily due to weather). 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•The increase in cash provided by other operating activities was driven primarily by a decrease in other assets (primarily due to non-current regulatory asset increases as a result of significant storm activity in 2018). 

(LG&E)

LG&E had a $49 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared with 2018.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Investing Activities

(All Registrants)

The components of the change in cash provided by (used in) investing activities were as follows:

57
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For PPL, in 2019 compared with 2018, the decrease in expenditures was due to lower project expenditures at WPD, PPL Electric, LKE and LG&E, partially offset by higher project expenditures at KU. The decrease in expenditures at WPD was primarily due to a decrease in expenditures to enhance system reliability and a decrease in foreign currency exchange rates. The decrease in expenditures for PPL Electric was primarily due to timing differences on capital spending projects related to ongoing efforts to improve reliability and replace aging infrastructure. The decrease in expenditures at LKE was primarily due to decreased spending for environmental water projects at LG&E and KU's Trimble County plant, LG&E’s Mill Creek plant and KU's Ghent plant, partially offset by spending on various other projects at KU that are not individually significant. 

See "Forecasted Uses of Cash" for detail regarding projected capital expenditures for the years 2020 through 2024.

(a)Issuances are net of pricing discounts, where applicable, and exclude the impact of debt issuance costs. Includes debt issuances with affiliates.

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional long-term debt information.

(PPL)

Equity Securities Activities

Equity Forward Contracts

In May 2018, PPL completed a registered underwritten public offering of 55 million shares of its common stock. In conjunction with that offering, the underwriters exercised an option to purchase 8.25 million additional shares of PPL common stock solely to cover over-allotments. 

In connection with the registered public offering, PPL entered into forward sale agreements with two counterparties covering the total 63.25 million shares of PPL common stock. Under the forward sale agreements, PPL was obligated to settle these forward sale agreements no later than November 2019. The forward sale agreements were classified as equity transactions. 

In September 2018, PPL settled a portion of the initial forward sale agreements by issuing 20 million shares of PPL common stock, resulting in net cash proceeds of $520 million. In November 2019, PPL settled the remaining 43.25 million shares of PPL common stock, resulting in net cash proceeds of $1.1 billion. The net proceeds received will be used for general corporate purposes. See Note 5 for information on the forward sale agreements impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

ATM Program

In February 2018, PPL entered into an equity distribution agreement, pursuant to which PPL may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate of $1.0 billion of its common stock through an at-the-market offering program, including a forward sales component. The compensation paid to the selling agents by PPL may be up to 2% of the gross offering proceeds of the shares. There were no issuances under the ATM program for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. PPL issued 42 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $119 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Forecasted Sources of Cash

(All Registrants)

The Registrants expect to continue to have adequate liquidity available from operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and commercial paper issuances. Additionally, subject to market conditions, the Registrants and their 

59
subsidiaries may access the capital markets, and PPL Electric, LG&E and KU anticipate receiving equity contributions from their parent or member in 2020.

Credit Facilities

The Registrants maintain credit facilities to enhance liquidity, provide credit support and provide a backstop to commercial paper programs. Amounts borrowed under these credit facilities are reflected in "Short-term debt" on the Balance Sheets. At December 31, 2019, the total committed borrowing capacity under credit facilities and the borrowings under these facilities were:

External

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)The syndicated credit facilities, KU's letter of credit facility and PPL Capital Funding's bilateral facility, each contain a financial covenant requiring debt to total capitalization not to exceed 70% for PPL Capital Funding, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU, as calculated in accordance with the facility, and other customary covenants.

The commitments under the domestic credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group, with no one bank and its affiliates providing an aggregate commitment of more than the following percentages of the total committed capacity: PPL - 8%, PPL Electric - 6%, LKE - 6%, LG&E - 6% and KU - 6%.

(b)Each company pays customary fees under its respective syndicated credit facility. Borrowings generally bear interest at LIBOR-based rates plus an applicable margin.

(c)The facilities contain financial covenants to maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 times consolidated earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization and total net debt not in excess of 85% of its RAV, calculated in accordance with the credit facility.

The amounts borrowed at December 31, 2019, include a USD-denominated borrowing of $200 million and GBP-denominated borrowings of £88 million, which equated to $113 million. At December 31, 2019, the USD equivalent of unused capacity under the U.K. committed credit facilities was approximately $1.0 billion.

The commitments under the U.K.'s credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group with no one bank providing more than 13% of the total committed capacity.

In addition to the financial covenants noted in the table above, the credit agreements governing the above credit facilities contain various other covenants. Failure to comply with the covenants after applicable grace periods could result in acceleration of repayment of borrowings and/or termination of the agreements. The Registrants monitor compliance with the covenants on a regular basis. At December 31, 2019, the Registrants were in compliance with these covenants. At this time, the Registrants believe that these covenants and other borrowing conditions will not limit access to these funding sources.

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of the Registrants' credit facilities.

Intercompany (LKE, LG&E and KU) 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

60
(a)LG&E and KU participate in an intercompany agreement whereby LKE, LG&E and/or KU make available funds up to $500 million at an interest rate based on a market index of commercial paper issues. However, the FERC has authorized a maximum aggregate short-term debt limit for each utility at $500 million from all covered sources.

See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of intercompany credit facilities.

Commercial Paper (All Registrants)

PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU maintain commercial paper programs to provide an additional financing source to fund short-term liquidity needs, as necessary. Commercial paper issuances, included in "Short-term debt" on the Balance Sheets, are supported by the respective Registrant's credit facilities. The following commercial paper programs were in place at:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Long-term Debt and Equity Securities

Contributions from Parent/Member (PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

From time to time, LKE's member or the parents of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU make capital contributions to subsidiaries. The proceeds from these contributions are used to fund capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes and, in the case of LKE, to make contributions to its subsidiaries.

61
Forecasted Uses of Cash

(All Registrants)

In addition to expenditures required for normal operating activities, such as purchased power, payroll, fuel and taxes, the Registrants currently expect to incur future cash outflows for capital expenditures, various contractual obligations, payment of dividends on its common stock, distributions by LKE to its member, and possibly the purchase or redemption of a portion of debt securities.

Capital Expenditures 

The table below shows the Registrants' current capital expenditure projections for the years 2020 through 2024. Expenditures for the domestic regulated utilities are expected to be recovered through rates, pending regulatory approval.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)Construction expenditures include capitalized interest and AFUDC, which are expected to total approximately $93 million for PPL and $77 million for PPL Electric over the five-year period.

62
(b)The 2020 total excludes amounts included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2019.

Capital expenditure plans are revised periodically to reflect changes in operational, market and regulatory conditions. For the years presented, this table includes PPL Electric's asset optimization program to replace aging transmission and distribution assets.

(a)Reflects principal maturities based on stated maturity or earlier put dates. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of variable-rate remarketable bonds issued on behalf of LG&E and KU. The Registrants do not have any significant finance lease obligations.

(b)Assumes interest payments through stated maturity or earlier put dates. For PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU the payments herein are subject to change, as payments for debt that is or becomes variable-rate debt have been estimated and for PPL, payments denominated in British pounds sterling have been translated to U.S. dollars at a current foreign currency exchange rate.

(c)See Note 9 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(d)The amounts include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Primarily includes, as applicable, the purchase obligations of electricity, coal, natural gas and limestone, as well as certain construction expenditures, which are also included in the Capital Expenditures table presented above.

(e)The amounts for PPL include WPD's contractual deficit pension funding requirements arising from actuarial valuations performed in March 2016. The U.K. electricity regulator currently allows a recovery of a substantial portion of the contributions relating to the plan deficit. The amounts also include contributions made or committed to be made in 2020 for PPL's and LKE's U.S. pension plans (for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU includes their share of these amounts). Based on the current funded status of these plans, except for WPD's plans, no cash contributions are required. See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of expected contributions.

(f)Represents contracts to purchase coal, natural gas and natural gas transportation. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information. 

(g)Represents future minimum payments under OVEC power purchase agreements through June 2040. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

(h)Represents construction commitments, which are also reflected in the Capital Expenditures table presented above.

Dividends/Distributions

(PPL)

PPL views dividends as an integral component of shareowner return and expects to continue to pay dividends in amounts intended to maintain a capitalization structure that supports investment grade credit ratings. In November 2019, PPL declared its quarterly common stock dividend, payable January 2, 2020, at 41.25 cents per share (equivalent to $1.65 per annum). On February 14, 2020, PPL announced an increase of its quarterly common stock dividend to 41.5 cents per share (equivalent to $1.66 per annum). Future dividends, declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors, will depend upon future earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements and other factors.

Subject to certain exceptions, PPL may not declare or pay any cash dividend or distribution on its capital stock during any period in which PPL Capital Funding defers interest payments on its 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes due 2067 or 2013 Series B Junior Subordinated Notes due 2073. At December 31, 2019, no interest payments were deferred.

(PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU)

From time to time, as determined by their respective Board of Directors, the Registrants pay dividends or distributions, as applicable, to their respective shareholders or members. Certain of the credit facilities of PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU include minimum debt covenant ratios that could effectively restrict the payment of dividends or distributions.

(All Registrants)

See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for these and other restrictions related to distributions on capital interests for the Registrants and their subsidiaries.

64
Purchase or Redemption of Debt Securities

The Registrants will continue to evaluate outstanding debt securities and may decide to purchase or redeem these securities in open market or privately negotiated transactions, in exchange transactions or otherwise, depending upon prevailing market conditions, available cash and other factors, and may be commenced or suspended at any time. The amounts involved may be material.

Rating Agency Actions

Moody's and S&P periodically review the credit ratings of the debt of the Registrants and their subsidiaries. Based on their respective independent reviews, the rating agencies may make certain ratings revisions or ratings affirmations.

A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the creditworthiness associated with an issuer and particular securities that it issues. The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries are based on information provided by the Registrants and other sources. The ratings of Moody's and S&P are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any securities of the Registrants or their subsidiaries. Such ratings may be subject to revisions or withdrawal by the agencies at any time and should be evaluated independently of each other and any other rating that may be assigned to the securities.

The credit ratings of the Registrants and their subsidiaries affect their liquidity, access to capital markets and cost of borrowing under their credit facilities. A downgrade in the Registrants' or their subsidiaries' credit ratings could result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets. The Registrants and their subsidiaries have no credit rating triggers that would result in the reduction of access to capital markets or the acceleration of maturity dates of outstanding debt.

The following table sets forth the Registrants' and their subsidiaries' credit ratings for outstanding debt securities or commercial paper programs as of December 31, 2019.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The rating agencies have taken the following actions related to the Registrants and their subsidiaries.

(PPL)

In September 2019, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of Baa1 and A- to WPD (East Midlands) £250 million of 1.75% Senior Notes due 2031.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In September 2019, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to PPL Electric's $400 million 3.00% First Mortgage Bonds due 2049.

65
(PPL, LKE and LG&E)

In March 2019, Moody’s and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to LG&E’s $400 million 4.25% First Mortgage Bonds due 2049. The bonds were issued April 1, 2019.

In March 2019, Moody’s and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to the County of Jefferson, Kentucky’s $128 million 1.85% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 2001 Series A, due 2033, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. The bonds were remarketed April 1, 2019.

In May 2019, Moody's assigned a rating of A1, and in June 2019, S&P assigned a rating of A to the County of Jefferson, Kentucky's $31 million 1.65% Series A Environmental Facilities Revenue Refunding Bonds, due 2033, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. The bonds were remarketed June 1, 2019.

In May 2019, Moody's assigned a rating of A1, and in June 2019, S&P assigned a rating of A to the County of Jefferson, Kentucky's $35 million 1.65% Series B Environmental Facilities Revenue Refunding Bonds, due 2033, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. The bonds were remarketed June 1, 2019.

In September 2019, Moody's and S&P assigned ratings of A1 and A to the County of Jefferson, Kentucky's $40 million 1.75% Pollution Control Revenue Bonds, 2005 Series A, due 2035, previously issued on behalf of LG&E. The bonds were remarketed September 17, 2019.

(PPL, LKE and KU) 

In March 2019, Moody’s assigned a rating of A1 and S&P assigned a rating of A to KU’s $300 million 4.375% First Mortgage Bonds due 2045. The bonds were issued April 1, 2019.

In August 2019, Moody's assigned a rating of A1, and in September 2019, S&P assigned a rating of A to the County of Carroll, Kentucky's $96 million 1.55% Pollution Control Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2016 Series A (Kentucky Utilities Company Project), due 2042, previously issued on behalf of KU. The bonds were remarketed September 3, 2019.

In August 2019, Moody's assigned a rating of A1, and in September 2019, S&P lowered its rating to A to the following bonds: 

•County of Carroll, Kentucky’s $50 million 1.75% Environmental Facilities Revenue Bonds, 2004 Series A due 2034; 

•County of Carroll, Kentucky’s $54 million 1.20% Environmental Facilities Revenue Refunding Bonds, 2006 Series B due 2034; 

•County of Carroll, Kentucky’s $78 million 1.20% Environmental Facilities Revenue Bonds, 2006 Series B due 2032; 

•County of Mercer, Kentucky’s $13 million 1.30% Solid Waste Disposal Facility Revenue Bonds, 2000 Series A due 2023. 

The bonds, previously issued on behalf of KU, were remarketed September 3, 2019. S&P and Moody’s lowered their ratings as a result of KU's termination of the letters of credit that previously provided credit enhancement for these bonds. See Note 8 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Ratings Triggers

(PPL)

As discussed in Note 8 to the Financial Statements, certain of WPD's senior unsecured notes may be put by the holders to the issuer for redemption if the long-term credit ratings assigned to the notes are withdrawn by any of the rating agencies (Moody's or S&P) or reduced to a non-investment grade rating of Ba1 or BB+ or lower in connection with a restructuring event. A restructuring event includes the loss of, or a material adverse change to, the distribution licenses under which WPD (East Midlands), WPD (South West), WPD (South Wales) and WPD (West Midlands) operate and would be a trigger event for each company. These notes totaled £5.4 billion (approximately $6.9 billion) nominal value at December 31, 2019.

(PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

Various derivative and non-derivative contracts, including contracts for the sale and purchase of electricity and fuel, commodity transportation and storage, interest rate and foreign currency instruments (for PPL), contain provisions that require the posting of additional collateral, or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract, if PPL's, LKE's, LG&E's or KU's or their subsidiaries' credit rating, as applicable, were to fall below investment grade. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for a 

66
discussion of "Credit Risk-Related Contingent Features," including a discussion of the potential additional collateral requirements for PPL, LKE and LG&E for derivative contracts in a net liability position at December 31, 2019.

Guarantees for Subsidiaries (PPL)

PPL guarantees certain consolidated affiliate financing arrangements. Some of the guarantees contain financial and other covenants that, if not met, would limit or restrict the consolidated affiliates' access to funds under these financing arrangements, accelerate maturity of such arrangements or limit the consolidated affiliates' ability to enter into certain transactions. At this time, PPL believes that these covenants will not limit access to relevant funding sources. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for additional information about guarantees.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements (All Registrants)

The Registrants have entered into certain agreements that may contingently require payment to a guaranteed or indemnified party. See Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of these agreements.

Risk Management

Market Risk

(All Registrants)

See Notes 1, 16 and 17 to the Financial Statements for information about the Registrants' risk management objectives, valuation techniques and accounting designations.

The forward-looking information presented below provides estimates of what may occur in the future, assuming certain adverse market conditions and model assumptions. Actual future results may differ materially from those presented. These are not precise indicators of expected future losses, but are rather only indicators of possible losses under normal market conditions at a given confidence level.

Interest Rate Risk

The Registrants and their subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. The Registrants and their subsidiaries utilize various financial derivative instruments to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of their debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under the risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolios due to changes in the absolute level of interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.

The following interest rate hedges were outstanding at December 31:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

67
(a)Includes accrued interest, if applicable.

(b)Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability. Sensitivities represent a 10% adverse movement in interest rates, except for cross-currency swaps which also includes a 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates.

(c)Changes in the fair value of these instruments are recorded in equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the item being hedged affects earnings.

(d)Realized changes in the fair value of such economic hedges are recoverable through regulated rates and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities.

The Registrants are exposed to a potential increase in interest expense and to changes in the fair value of their debt portfolios. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on interest expense at December 31, 2019 and 2018 was insignificant for PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU. The estimated impact of a 10% adverse movement in interest rates on the fair value of debt at December 31 is shown below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Foreign Currency Risk (PPL)

PPL is exposed to foreign currency risk primarily through investments in and earnings of U.K. affiliates. Under its risk management program, PPL may enter into financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency exposures, including translation risk of expected earnings, firm commitments, recognized assets or liabilities, anticipated transactions and net investments.

The following foreign currency hedges were outstanding at December 31:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Effects of adverse movements decrease assets or increase liabilities, as applicable, which could result in an asset becoming a liability.

(b)To economically hedge the translation of expected earnings denominated in GBP.

(All Registrants)

Commodity Price Risk

PPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its domestic subsidiaries as described below.

•PPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is insignificant and mitigated through its PUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.

•LG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply expenses. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these expenses.

Volumetric Risk

Volumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below.

68
•WPD is exposed to volumetric risk which is significantly mitigated as a result of the method of regulation in the U.K. Under the RIIO-ED1 price control regulations, recovery of such exposure occurs on a two year lag. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information on revenue recognition under RIIO-ED1.

•PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases.

Defined Benefit Plans - Equity Securities Price Risk

See "Application of Critical Accounting Policies - Defined Benefits" for additional information regarding the effect of equity securities price risk on plan assets.

Credit Risk

(All Registrants)

Credit risk is the risk that the Registrants would incur a loss as a result of nonperformance by counterparties of their contractual obligations. The Registrants maintain credit policies and procedures with respect to counterparty credit (including requirements that counterparties maintain specified credit ratings) and require other assurances in the form of credit support or collateral in certain circumstances in order to limit counterparty credit risk. However, the Registrants, as applicable, have concentrations of suppliers and customers among electric utilities, financial institutions and energy marketing and trading companies. These concentrations may impact the Registrants' overall exposure to credit risk, positively or negatively, as counterparties may be similarly affected by changes in economic, regulatory or other conditions.

(PPL and PPL Electric)

In January 2017, the PUC issued a Final Order approving PPL Electric's PLR procurement plan for the period June 2017 through May 2021, which includes a total of eight semi-annual solicitations for electricity supply in April and October. To date, PPL Electric has conducted six of its planned eight competitive solicitations.

Under the standard Supply Master Agreement (the Agreement) for the competitive solicitation process, PPL Electric requires all suppliers to post collateral if their credit exposure exceeds an established credit limit. In the event a supplier defaults on its obligation, PPL Electric would be required to seek replacement power in the market. All incremental costs incurred by PPL Electric would be recoverable from customers in future rates. At December 31, 2019, most of the successful bidders under all of the solicitations had an investment grade credit rating from S&P and were not required to post collateral under the Agreement. A small portion of bidders were required to post an insignificant amount of collateral under the Agreement. There is no instance under the Agreement in which PPL Electric is required to post collateral to its suppliers.

See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for additional information on credit risk.

Foreign Currency Translation (PPL)

The value of the British pound sterling fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. In 2019, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $106 million, which reflected a $181 million increase to PP&E, $34 million increase to goodwill and $12 million decrease to other net liabilities partially offset by a $121 million increase to long-term debt. In 2018, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation loss of $453 million, which reflected a $754 million decrease to PP&E and $150 million decrease to goodwill partially offset by a $445 million decrease to long-term debt and a decrease of $6 million to other net liabilities. In 2017, changes in this exchange rate resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of $537 million, which reflected a $935 million increase to PP&E and $198 million increase to goodwill partially offset by a $549 million increase to long-term debt and an increase of $47 million to other net liabilities.

(All Registrants)

Related Party Transactions

The Registrants are not aware of any material ownership interests or operating responsibility by senior management in outside partnerships, including leasing transactions with variable interest entities, or other entities doing business with the Registrants. See Note 14 to the Financial Statements for additional information on related party transactions for PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU.

69
Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures

The Registrants from time to time evaluate opportunities for potential acquisitions, divestitures and development projects. Development projects are reexamined based on market conditions and other factors to determine whether to proceed with, modify or terminate the projects. Any resulting transactions may impact future financial results.

Capacity Needs (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

As a result of environmental requirements and energy efficiency measures, KU retired two older coal-fired electricity generating units at the E.W. Brown plant in February 2019 with a combined summer rating capacity of 272 MW. Despite the retirement of these units, LG&E and KU maintain sufficient generating capacity to serve their anticipated load.

Environmental Matters

(All Registrants)

Extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations are applicable to PPL's, PPL Electric's, LKE's, LG&E's and KU's air emissions, water discharges and the management of hazardous and solid waste, as well as other aspects of the Registrants' businesses. The costs of compliance or alleged non-compliance cannot be predicted with certainty but could be significant. In addition, costs may increase significantly if the requirements or scope of environmental laws or regulations, or similar rules, are expanded or changed. Costs may take the form of increased capital expenditures or operating and maintenance expenses, monetary fines, penalties or other restrictions. Many of these environmental law considerations are also applicable to the operations of key suppliers, or customers, such as coal producers and industrial power users, and may impact the costs for their products or their demand for the Registrants' services. Increased capital and operating costs are subject to rate recovery. PPL, PPL Electric, LKE, LG&E and KU can provide no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of future environmental or rate proceedings before regulatory authorities.

See "Legal Matters" in Note 13 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of the more significant environmental claims. See "Financial Condition - Liquidity and Capital Resources - Forecasted Uses of Cash - Capital Expenditures" in "Item 7. Combined Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information on projected environmental capital expenditures for 2020 through 2024. See Note 19 to the Financial Statements for information related to the impacts of CCRs on AROs.

Sustainability

Increasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of “sustainability”, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer’s business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “’34 Act”), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their ’34 Act reports. To date, no new reporting requirements have been adopted or proposed by the SEC.

As has been PPL’s practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at www.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric utility industry. Additionally, PPL publicly discloses its corporate political contributions and responds to the CDP climate survey.

70
Cybersecurity

See “Cybersecurity Management” in “Item 1. Business” and “Item 1A. Risk factors” for a discussion of cybersecurity risks affecting the Registrants and the related strategies for managing these risks.

Competition

See "Competition" under each of PPL's reportable segments in "Item 1. Business - General - Segment Information" and "Item 1A. Risk Factors" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants.

New Accounting Guidance

See Notes 1 and 21 to the Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption.

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

Financial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.

Defined Benefits

(All Registrants)

Certain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 7 and 11 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.

A summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Does not sponsor or participate in other postretirement benefits plans.

(b)The pension plans sponsored by LKE and LG&E were merged effective January 1, 2020 into the LG&E and KU Pension Plan. The merged plan is sponsored by LKE. LG&E and KU participate in this plan.

Management makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are:

•Discount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for U.S. defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and expected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.

71
In selecting the discount rate for its U.K. pension plans, WPD starts with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for its plans. These plan-specific cash flows are matched against a spot-rate yield curve to determine the assumed discount rate. The spot-rate yield curve uses an iBoxx British pounds sterling denominated corporate bond index as its base. From this base, those bonds with the lowest and highest yields are eliminated to develop an appropriate subset of bonds. WPD uses the single weighted-average discount rate derived from the spot rates to discount the benefit obligation. In addition, the spot rates that match the cash flows associated with the service cost and interest cost are used to discount those components of net periodic defined benefit cost.

•Expected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.

•Rate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.

See Note 11 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. 

The following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary defined benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

72
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Income Taxes (All Registrants)

Significant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, as well as whether the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested.

Additionally, significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit recognized related to an uncertain tax position. On a quarterly basis, uncertain tax positions are reassessed by considering information known as of the reporting date. Based on management's assessment of new information, a tax benefit may subsequently be recognized for a previously unrecognized tax position, a previously recognized tax position may be derecognized, or the benefit of a previously recognized tax position may be remeasured. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.

The need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets also requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers a number of factors in assessing the realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy utilized in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria utilized to account for an uncertain tax position. Management also considers the uncertainty posed by political risk and the effect of this uncertainty on the various factors that management takes into account in evaluating the need for valuation allowances. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.

See Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures, including the impact of the TCJA and management's conclusion that the undistributed earnings of WPD are considered indefinitely reinvested. Based on this conclusion, PPL Global does not record deferred U.S. federal income taxes on WPD's undistributed earnings.

Regulatory Assets and Liabilities

(All Registrants)

PPL Electric, LG&E and KU are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.

Management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based 

73
on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.

See Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2019 and 2018, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.

(PPL)

WPD's operations are regulated by Ofgem. Ofgem has adopted a price control regulatory framework focused on outputs and performance in contrast to traditional U.S. utility ratemaking that operates under a cost recovery model. Because the regulatory model is incentive-based, WPD is not subject to accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP for entities subject to cost-based rate regulation and does not record regulatory assets and liabilities. See "General - Regulation" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional information.

Price Risk Management (PPL)

See "Financial Condition - Risk Management" above.

Goodwill Impairment (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU) 

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. PPL has determined its reporting units to be primarily at the same level as its reportable segments. LKE, LG&E and KU are individually single operating and reportable segments. A goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill is tested for impairment after a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed of.

PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a two-step quantitative test. See “Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)” in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of qualitative and quantitative goodwill impairment tests. See Note 18 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances at December 31, 2019.

PPL elected to perform the two-step quantitative impairment test of goodwill for the U.K. Regulated segment reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2019. Management used both discounted cash flows and market multiples including implied RAV premiums, which required significant assumptions, to estimate the fair value of the reporting units. Significant assumptions used in the discounted cash flows include discount and growth rates, outcomes of future rate filings, and projected operating and capital cash flows. Projected operating and capital cash flows is based on the Registrants' internal business plan, which assumes the occurrence of certain future events. Significant assumptions used in the market multiples include utility sector market performance and comparable transactions.

Application of an appropriate weighting to both the discounted cash flow and market multiple valuations for the most recent impairment test performed as of October 1, 2019 did not require the second-step assessment and did not result in any impairment. 

A high degree of judgment is required to develop estimates related to fair value conclusions. A decrease in the forecasted cash flows of 10%, an increase in the discount rate of 0.25%, or a 10% decrease in the market multiples would not have resulted in an impairment of goodwill for this reporting unit.

PPL (for its Kentucky Regulated segment), and individually, LKE, LG&E and KU elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill, as of October 1, 2019. Based on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying values. As such, the two-step quantitative impairment test was not performed.

Asset Retirement Obligations (PPL, LKE, LG&E and KU)

ARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense over the asset's useful life.

In determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.

See “Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations” in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 19 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.

At December 31, 2019, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. At December 31, 2019, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $33 million. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $2 million. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.

Revenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues (LKE, LG&E and KU)

Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. For LG&E and KU, such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue estimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. See "Unbilled revenues" on the Registrants' Balance Sheets for balances at December 31, 2019 and 2018.
