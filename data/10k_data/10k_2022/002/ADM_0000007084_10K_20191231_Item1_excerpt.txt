Company Overview

Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (the Company or ADM) unlocks the power of nature to provide access to nutrition worldwide. ADM is a global leader in human and animal nutrition and one of the world’s premier agricultural origination and processing companies. The Company's breadth, depth, insights, facilities, and logistical expertise give it exceptional capabilities to meet needs for food, beverages, health and wellness, and more. From the seed of the idea to the outcome of the solution, ADM enriches the quality of life the world over. 

ADM was incorporated in Delaware in 1923, successor to the Daniels Linseed Co. founded in 1902. Today, it is one of the world’s leading producers of ingredients for human and animal nutrition, and other products made from nature. The Company works with customers to bring a wide array of natural products – including proteins, flavors, colors, flours, fibers, and more – together into unique and innovative solutions to meet consumer needs. In addition, ADM offers a deep portfolio of plant-based products for other uses, such as replacing petroleum-based plastics.

In order to meet consumer needs, ADM has an expansive origination, transportation, and production footprint. The Company operates an extensive global grain elevator and transportation network to procure, store, clean, and transport agricultural raw materials, such as oilseeds, corn, wheat, milo, oats, and barley, as well as products derived from those inputs. ADM’s production facilities around the globe produce a wide array of products, ingredients, and solutions. In addition, ADM has significant investments in joint ventures that aim to expand or enhance the market for its products or offer other benefits including, but not limited to, geographic or product-line expansion.

Segment Descriptions

Effective July 1, 2019, the Company changed its segment reporting to reflect the creation of the combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment. The former Origination and Oilseeds businesses were merged into a combined Ag Services and Oilseeds segment which enables the Company to better respond to market changes by integrating the supply and value chains and risk management, while delivering significant simplification and efficiency to the day-to-day business. As part of the Company’s efforts for a streamlined management structure, the combined segment is led by the former President of Oilseeds expanding his role to President of Ag Services and Oilseeds. 

The Company’s operations are organized, managed, and classified into three reportable business segments: Ag Services and Oilseeds, Carbohydrate Solutions, and Nutrition. Each of these segments is organized based upon the nature of products and services offered. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable business segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Other. Financial information with respect to the Company’s reportable business segments is set forth in Note 17 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8 herein, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (Item 8).

Methods of Distribution

The Company’s products are distributed mainly in bulk from processing plants or storage facilities directly to customers’ facilities. The Company has developed a comprehensive transportation capability to efficiently move both commodities and processed products virtually anywhere in the world. The Company owns or leases a significant portion of the trucks, trailers, railroad tank and hopper cars, river barges, towboats, and ocean-going vessels used to transport the Company’s products to its customers.

Concentration of Revenues by Product

The following products accounted for 10% or more of revenues for the following periods:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Status of New Products

The Company continues to expand the size and global reach of its business through the development of new products. Acquisitions, especially in the Nutrition segment, expand the Company’s ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers’ evolving and expanding nutritional needs through its offering of natural flavor and ingredient products. The Company does not expect any individual new product to have a significant impact on the Company’s revenues in 2020. 

Source and Availability of Raw Materials

A significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities. In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis. The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials.

Trademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property

The Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $948 million as of December 31, 2019. The Company does not consider any segment of its business to be dependent upon any single or group of trademarks, brands, recipes, or other intellectual property. 

Seasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers

Since the Company is widely diversified in global agribusiness markets, there are no material seasonal fluctuations in overall global processing volumes and the sale and distribution of its products and services. There is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains.

Item 1.BUSINESS (Continued)

The prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements. Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months. Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels. No material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world. Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.

Competition

The Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company. Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio.

Research and Development 

Research and development expense during the year ended December 31, 2019, net of reimbursements of government grants, was $154 million.

The Company’s laboratories and technical innovation centers around the world enhance its ability to interact with customers globally, not only to provide flavors, but also to support the sales of other food ingredients. The acquisition of Wild Flavors in October 2014 approximately doubled the number of scientists and technicians in research and development. Since that time, additional laboratories have been added, including food & beverages applications laboratories in Fort Collins, Colorado, and Bergamo, Italy as well as expanded laboratories in Decatur, Illinois and Shanghai, China. 

 The Company expanded its human health and nutrition portfolio in February 2017 with the acquisition of a controlling interest in Biopolis SL (Biopolis), a leading provider of probiotics and genomic services. Biopolis provides genomic sequencing capabilities for the Company's customers as well as for its internal use. Biopolis also has high through-put biological functionality testing capabilities that can be used to discover new probiotics and nutraceuticals. In January 2018, the Company announced a joint development agreement with Vland Biotech to develop and commercialize enzymes for animal feed. In April 2018, the Company opened its new enzyme development laboratory in Davis, California to advance the research and development of feed enzyme as well as enzymes for internal use. In August 2018, the Company further expanded its probiotics business with the acquisition of Probiotics International Limited. With the acquisition of Neovia in early 2019, ADM further expanded its R&D capabilities in Animal Nutrition, globally. In December 2019, the Company opened a new Animal Nutrition Technology Center in Decatur, Illinois, to further expand its animal nutrition capabilities to support customer innovation in pet and aqua food production in North America. 

ADM Ventures, which was launched by the Company in 2016, continues to select high-potential, new product development projects from within its business units. The first internal venture funded project, a new sweetener, has been fully commercialized and is being sold in the United States by our Carbohydrate Solutions team. Through the acquisition of Neovia, ADM Ventures further expanded its equity investments in promising, early-stage start-up companies from three to six, and is looking at several others in which the Company may choose to invest.

The Company is continuing to invest in research to develop a broad range of sustainable materials with an objective to produce key intermediate materials that serve as a platform for producing a variety of sustainable packaging products. Conversion technologies include utilizing expertise in both fermentation and catalysis. The Company’s current portfolio includes products that are in the early development phase and those that are close to pilot plant demonstration. The Company’s project with DuPont to develop sustainable packaging solutions with improved barrier properties has progressed to a pilot production facility that opened in April 2018. This facility provides samples for customers as well as engineering data for a full-scale plant. In 2019, the Company announced a joint venture with LG Chem, Ltd. to develop biobased acrylic acid using ingredients from the Company's corn processing. Acrylic acid is a key element required in the manufacture of superabsorbent polymers used in a range of hygiene products, including diapers.

Environmental Compliance

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company spent $48 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and compliance with the requirements of various environmental agencies.

There have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment.

A number of jurisdictions where the Company has operations have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions including, but not limited to, the U.S., Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and its member states, and China. The Company's operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet their obligations in this regard with no significant impact on the earnings and competitive position of the Company. The Company’s business could be affected in the future by additional global, regional, national, and local regulation, pricing of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change legislation, regulation or agreements. It is difficult at this time to estimate the likelihood of passage, or predict the potential impact, of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements. Potential consequences of new obligations could include increased energy, transportation, raw material, and administrative costs, and may require the Company to make additional investments in its facilities and equipment.

Number of Employees

The number of full-time employees of the Company was approximately 38,100 at December 31, 2019 and 31,600 at December 31, 2018. The net increase in the number of full-time employees is primarily related to acquisitions net of the early retirement and reorganization initiatives.
