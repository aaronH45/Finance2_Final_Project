ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the "Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" included below the Table of Contents, "Risk Factors" included herein Item 1A, "Selected Financial Data" included herein this Item 6, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in Item 8.

Executive Summary

2019 Operating Performance and Capital Management 

For 2019, we reported net income of $1,100.3 million, or $5.24 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $523.4 million, or $2.38 per diluted common share, in 2018. Net income includes net realized investment gains and losses. Included in our results for 2019 are costs related to the early retirement of debt of $27.3 million before tax and $21.6 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted common share. Included in our 2018 results is a reserve increase related to our long-term care block of business of $750.8 million before tax and $593.1 million after tax, or $2.70 per diluted common share. Adjusting for these items, after-tax adjusted operating income for 2019 was $1,140.6 million, or $5.44 per diluted common share compared to $1,145.0 million, or $5.20 per diluted common share for 2018. See "Long-term Care Reserve Increase, "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures," and "Consolidated Operating Results" contained herein in this Item 7 for further discussion and a reconciliation of these items.

Our Unum US segment reported an increase in adjusted operating income of 1.6 percent in 2019 compared to 2018, with growth in premium income, partially offset by lower net investment income and higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs. The benefit ratio for our Unum US segment for 2019 was 66.9 percent, compared to 67.2 percent in 2018. Unum US sales decreased 0.4 percent in 2019 compared to 2018. Persistency in our group product lines was stable while persistency in our supplemental and voluntary product lines was less favorable. 

Our Unum International segment reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 5.3 percent in 2019 compared to 2018, as measured in U.S. dollars. Our Unum UK line of business reported a decrease in adjusted operating income of 4.3 percent compared to 2018, as measured in local currency, due primarily to unfavorable benefits experience, partially offset by an increase in premium income and net investment income. The benefit ratio for our Unum UK line of business was 76.7 percent in 2019 compared to 74.4 percent in 2018. Unum International sales, as measured in U.S. dollars, increased 14.9 percent in 2019 compared to 2018. Unum UK sales, as measured in local currency, increased 8.5 percent in 2019 compared to 2018. Persistency was higher overall relative to the prior year. 

Our Colonial Life segment reported an increase in adjusted operating income of 2.8 percent in 2019 compared to 2018 due to growth in premium income, partially offset by higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs and lower net investment income. The 2019 benefit ratio for Colonial Life was 51.3 percent, which was generally consistent with 51.4 percent in 2018. Colonial Life sales increased 0.8 percent in 2019 compared to 2018. Persistency was lower relative to the prior year. 

Our Closed Block segment reported adjusted operating income of $137.7 million in 2019. In 2018, our Closed Block segment reported a loss of $625.3 million. Excluding the 2018 long-term care reserve increase, adjusted operating income for this segment was $125.5 million in 2018. The increase in adjusted operating income in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to an increase in net investment income and overall favorable benefits experience, partially offset by lower premium income. The long-term care interest adjusted loss ratio for 2019 was not comparable to 2018 due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was within our range of expectations. Benefits experience for individual disability was favorable in 2019 compared to 2018 and remains within our expectations. 

Our net investment income yields continue to be pressured by the low interest rate environment as we maintain consistent credit quality in our invested asset portfolio. The net unrealized gain on our fixed maturity securities was $6.4 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.7 billion at December 31, 2018, with the increase due primarily to a decline in U.S. Treasury rates and credit spreads during 2019. The earned book yield on our investment portfolio was 5.00 percent for 2019 compared to a yield of 5.15 percent for 2018. 

We believe our capital and financial positions are strong. At December 31, 2019, the RBC ratio for our traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, calculated on a weighted average basis using the NAIC Company Action Level formula, was approximately 365 percent, which is in line with our expectations. During 2019, we repurchased 12.3 million shares of Unum Group common stock under our share repurchase program, at a cost of approximately $400 million. Our weighted average 

33

common shares outstanding, assuming dilution, equaled 209.9 million for 2019 compared to 220.1 million for 2018, reflecting our capital management strategy of returning capital to shareholders through repurchases of our common stock. As of December 31, 2019, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies held fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, and cash of $863 million.

2018 Long-term Care Reserve Increase

Policy reserves for our long-term care block of business are determined using the gross premium valuation method and, prior to the third quarter of 2018, were valued based on assumptions established as of December 31, 2014, the date of our last assumption update under loss recognition. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. We undertake a review of policy reserve adequacy annually during the fourth quarter of each year, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the review.

During the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions. The review utilized internal and external data and outside consulting firms for quality assurance and industry benchmarking. Based on our analysis, during the third quarter of 2018, we updated our reserve assumptions and determined that our policy and claim reserves should be increased by $750.8 million, or $593.1 million after-tax, to reflect our current estimate of future benefit obligations. This increase was primarily driven by the update to our liability and interest rate assumptions, particularly claims incidence and claim termination rates, which resulted in an increase to reserves of approximately $2.2 billion. Partially offsetting the increase was the update to our assumptions for premium rate increases which decreased reserves approximately $1.4 billion, resulting in the net increase to reserves of $750.8 million. See "Trends in Key Assumptions" contained herein in the "Critical Accounting Estimates" of this Item 7 for further discussion of the assumptions used in our long-term care reserve update.

2018 Acquisitions of Business

In November 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Jaimini Health, Inc. (Jaimini Health), a dental health maintenance organization. The acquisition of Jaimini Health will broaden our employee benefit dental offerings in the U.S., particularly in the state of California and is reported in our Unum US segment. 

In October 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Pramerica Zycie TUiR S.A. (which we have subsequently renamed Unum Zycie TUiR S.A. and refer to as Unum Poland), a financial protection benefits provider in Poland. This acquisition will expand our European presence, which we believe to be an attractive market for financial protection benefits. 

In January 2018, we acquired 100 percent of the shares and voting interests in Leavelogic, Inc (Leavelogic), a leave management technology provider. The acquisition of Leavelogic will enhance our current leave management offerings by providing tools for employers and employees to better manage the family leave process and is reported in our Unum US segment. 

See Note 13 of the " Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements‚Äù contained herein in Item 8 for further details.

Unclaimed Death Benefits (UDB) Reserve Increase

Similar to other insurers, we were the subject of an examination by a third party acting on behalf of a number of state treasurers concerning our compliance with the unclaimed property laws of the participating states. We cooperated fully with this examination and in the fourth quarter of 2017, we started the process to reach a Global Resolution Agreement with the third party regarding settlement of the examination, which we finalized in January of 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, the third party acting on behalf of the signatory states compared insured data to the Social Security Administration's Death Master File to identify deceased insureds and contract holders where a valid claim has not been made. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we established reserves which reflected our estimate of the liability expected to be paid as we execute on the terms of the settlement. Claim reserves were increased $18.5 million for Unum US group life, $8.1 million for Unum US voluntary life, and $12.4 million for Colonial Life voluntary life, for a total reserve increase of $39.0 million before tax and $25.4 million after tax.

U.S. Tax Reform

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Federal government enacted a tax bill, H.R.1, An Act to Provide Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, more commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). The TCJA, among other things, included a reduction to the U.S. corporate statutory tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits (Deemed Repatriation Tax) at reduced rates. As a result of these changes, we recognized a tax benefit of $97.9 million in 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with our U.S. operations to the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate and a tax expense of $66.4 million resulting from the Deemed Repatriation Tax. See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1 and Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further details. 

U.K. Referendum

On January 31, 2020, an official bill was passed formalizing the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU. The bill gives approval to an 11- month transition period, until December 31, 2020, to allow for further negotiations regarding the details of the future relationship. We do not expect that the underlying operations of our U.K. business to be significantly impacted by the withdrawal but we may see some continued dampening of growth in the U.K. as well as earnings volatility due to the current disruption and uncertainty in the U.K. economy. We may also experience volatility in the fair values of our investments in U.K. and EU-based issuers, but we do not expect a material increase in other-than-temporary impairments or defaults, nor do we believe this volatility will impact our ability to hold these investments. There are currently no indications that capital requirements for our U.K. operations will change, but economic conditions may cause volatility in our solvency ratios. Our reported consolidated financial results may continue to be impacted by fluctuations in the British pound sterling to dollar exchange rate. See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1, "Risk Factors" contained herein Item 1A, and "Unum International Segment" contained herein this Item 7.

Consolidated Company Outlook for 2020 

We believe our disciplined approach to providing financial protection products at the workplace puts us in a position of strength as we seek to capitalize on the growing and largely unfilled need for our products and services. We believe the need for our products and services remains strong, and we intend to continue protecting our solid margins and returns through our pricing and risk management actions. Our strategy is centered on growing our existing business, expanding our reach, and investing in our operations and technology to anticipate and respond to new market demands to meet the changing needs of our customers.

We expect a continuation of the positive operating trends in our core businesses during 2020, with solid premium growth, consistent risk management, and a continued focus on operational efficiencies. 

The low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields as well as discount rates on our insurance liabilities. Our reported consolidated financial results may also continue to be unfavorably impacted by political and economic uncertainty in the U.K., specifically lower interest rates, wage inflation, employer spending, and claims volatility. 

We continue to analyze and employ strategies that we believe will help us navigate the current environment and allow us to maintain solid operating margins and significant financial flexibility to support the needs of our businesses, while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders and exploring merger and acquisition opportunities to enhance our business lines. The continued strong labor market in the U.S. and the high level of consumer confidence will have positive impacts on our business. We have substantial leverage to rising interest rates and an improving economy which generates payroll growth and wage inflation. We believe that consistent operating results, combined with the implementation of strategic initiatives and the effective deployment of capital, will allow us to meet our long-term financial objectives.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures

We analyze our performance using non-GAAP financial measures. A non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measure of "after-tax adjusted operating income" differs from net income as presented in our consolidated operating results and income statements prepared in accordance with GAAP due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. We believe after-tax adjusted operating income is a better performance measure and better indicator of the profitability and underlying trends in our business. 

Realized investment gains or losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments. Our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains or losses. Although we may experience realized investment gains or losses which will affect future earnings levels, a long-term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business since our underlying business is long-term in nature, and we need to earn the interest rates assumed in calculating our liabilities. 

We may at other times exclude certain other items from our discussion of financial ratios and metrics in order to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals. We exclude these items as we believe them to be infrequent or unusual in nature, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur and does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of our overall profitability. 

See "Executive Summary" contained herein in Item 7 and Notes 6, 7, 8, and 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion regarding the impacts of the long-term care reserve increase, the TCJA, the unclaimed death benefit reserve increase, cost related to the early retirement of debt, and the loss from a guaranty fund assessment, respectively.

A reconciliation of GAAP financial measures to our non-GAAP financial measures is as follows:

36

We measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items as specified in the reconciliations below. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income. 

A reconciliation of total revenue to "adjusted operating revenue" and income before income tax to "adjusted operating income" is as follows:

Critical Accounting Estimates

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known, which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements. The accounting estimates deemed to be most critical to our financial position and results of operations are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits, deferred acquisition costs, valuation of investments, pension and postretirement benefit plans, income taxes, and contingent liabilities. For additional information, refer to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Reserves for Policy and Contract Benefits

Reserves for policy and contract benefits are our largest liabilities and represent claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders. The two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us. Reserves for policy and contract benefits equaled $43.7 billion and $43.3 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, or approximately 76.6 percent and 81.3 percent of our total liabilities, respectively. Reserves ceded to reinsurers were $7.2 billion at both December 31, 2019 and 2018 and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets. 

Policy Reserves 

Policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums, allowing a margin for expenses and profit. These reserves relate primarily to our non-interest sensitive products, including our individual disability and voluntary benefits products in our Unum US segment; individual disability and life products in our Unum International segment; disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our Colonial Life segment; and individual disability, long-term care, and other products in our Closed Block segment. The reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate (i.e. loss recognition occurs). 

‚Ä¢Persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations. 

‚Ä¢Claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations. 

‚Ä¢Discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns. 

In establishing policy reserves, we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience, which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation. We do not, however, establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions.

We perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually, or more frequently if appropriate, using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test, without a provision for adverse deviation. We group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests. If the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance, the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency. Thereafter, the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing, referred to as the gross premium valuation method, wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation (loss recognition) date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive. 

Because the key policy reserve assumptions for policy persistency, mortality and morbidity, and discount rates are all locked in at policy issuance based on assumptions appropriate at that time, policy reserve assumptions are generally not changed due to a change in claim status from active to disabled subsequent to policy issuance. Depending on the funding mechanism, a full policy reserve is held during disability reflecting continued funding of the full policy reserve during a disability claim, or a fractional policy reserve is held reflecting that the individual policyholder would need to recover before he or she can again generate future claims for a separate occurrence. The policy reserves build up and release over time based on assumptions made at the time of policy issuance such that the reserve is eliminated as policyholders either reach the terminal age for coverage, die, or voluntarily lapse the policy. Policy reserves for Unum US, Unum International, and Colonial Life products are determined using the net 

38

level premium method as prescribed by GAAP. In applying this method, we use, as applicable by product type, morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions, claim resolution rate assumptions, and policy persistency assumptions, among others, to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income. We then apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims and claim expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive, with a provision for profit allowed. 

Policy reserves for our Closed Block segment include certain older policy forms for individual disability, individual and group long-term care, and certain other products, all of which are no longer actively marketed. The reserves for individual disability and individual and group long-term care are determined using the gross premium valuation method. Key assumptions are persistency, mortality and morbidity, claim incidence, claim resolution rates, commission rates, and maintenance expense rates. For long-term care, premium rate increases are also a key assumption. We apply an interest, or discount, rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims, commissions, and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive, with no provision for future profit. The interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for these blocks of business. Under the gross premium valuation method, we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions. Gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient in the future.

Policy reserves for certain other products, excluding individual disability and individual and group long-term care, which are no longer actively marketed and are reported in our Closed Block segment represent $5.8 billion on a gross basis. We have ceded $5.1 billion of reserves related to the other products, which are primarily comprised of policy reserves, to reinsurers. The ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable. We continue to service a block of group pension products, which we have not ceded, and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates. Expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities.

Claim Reserves

Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) to us and, as prescribed by GAAP, equals our long-term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. A claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim, such as the benefits available under the applicable policy, the covered benefit period, the age, and, as appropriate, the occupation and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets, including those for social security and other government-based welfare benefits. Reserves for IBNR claims, similar to incurred claim reserves, include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates, but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims, these reserves are also established based on historical incidence rate assumptions, including claim reporting patterns, the average cost of claims, and the expected volumes of incurred claims. Our incurred claim reserves and IBNR claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions.

Claim reserves, unlike policy reserves, are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change. Each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate. If we believe, based on our actual experience and our view of future events, that our long-term assumptions need to be modified, we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income.

Multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities, with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages. Available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method, the paid loss development method, the incurred loss development method, the count and severity method, and the expected claim cost method. No single method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines. The estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves.

We use a tabular reserve methodology on reported claims for our Unum US group long-term disability and individual disability claims as well as for our Closed Block individual disability and group and individual long-term care claims. Under the tabular reserve methodology, reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants, such as age, length of time disabled, and medical diagnosis, as well as assumptions regarding claim duration, discount rate, and policy benefit offsets. We believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long-term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim. IBNR claim reserves for our long-term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs. For Unum US group short-term disability products, an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted, as well as on 

39

IBNR claims, is determined in aggregate using a paid loss development method rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for reported claims on long-term products. The average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long-term liabilities and results in less estimation variability. 

Claim reserves for Unum US group life and accidental death and dismemberment products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid, IBNR death claims, and a liability for waiver of premium benefits. The death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid, the IBNR reserve is calculated using the paid loss development method, and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology. 

Claim reserves supporting the group and individual dental and vision products reported in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments have a short claim payout period. As a result, the reserves, which primarily represent IBNR and a small amount of claims pending payment, are calculated using the paid loss development method.

Claim reserves supporting our Unum International segment are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for Unum US disability and group term life reserves. Claim reserves for our Unum UK group dependent life product are calculated using discounted cash flows, based on our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates. The assumptions used in calculating claim reserves for this segment are based on standard country-specific industry experience, adjusted for our own experience. 

The majority of the Colonial Life segment lines of business have short-term benefits, which generally have less estimation variability than our long-term products because of the shorter claim payout period. Our claim reserves for Colonial Life's lines of business are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience. The incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date. Where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate, we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure. The key assumptions for claim reserves for the Colonial Life segment lines of business are the timing, rate, and amount of estimated future claim payments; and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims. 

40

The following table displays policy reserves, incurred claim reserves, and IBNR claim reserves by major product line, with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable. Incurred claim reserves represent the expected benefits payable under each incurred claim, along with other expenses associated with the payment of the claims. IBNR claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products. The IBNR and reopened claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring. Impacting year over year comparability of policy and claim reserves in the following chart is the 2018 long-term care reserve increase. See "Executive Summary" contained herein in this Item 7 and Note 6 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Key Assumptions

The calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions, but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are (1) the discount rate, (2) the claim resolution rate, and (3) the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves. Of these assumptions, our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time. 

1.The discount rate, which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value. A higher discount rate produces a lower reserve. If the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns, our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments. In this case, the reserves may eventually be insufficient. We set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves, considering current and expected future market conditions. If the investment yield on new investments that are purchased differs from the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio, the discount rate assumption on claims may be adjusted to reflect the impact of the new investment yield.

2.The claim resolution rate, used for both policy reserves and incurred and IBNR claim reserves, is the probability that a disability or long-term care claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured. It is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim. Estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time. Claim resolution assumptions involve many factors, including the cause of disability, the policyholder's age, the type of contractual benefits provided, and the time since initial disability. We primarily use our own 

42

claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions. These assumptions are established for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability. Our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years, with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years. We also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience. 

3.The incidence rate, used for policy reserves and IBNR claim reserves, is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us. The incidence rate is affected by many factors, including the age of the insured, the insured's occupation or industry, the benefit plan design, and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment. We establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations. 

Establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors. Reserves, particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long-term disabilities and long-term care, are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion. The impact of internal and external events, such as changes in claims operational procedures, economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence, the emergence of new diseases, new trends and developments in medical treatments, and legal trends and legislative changes, including changes to social security and other government-based welfare benefits programs which provide policy benefit offsets, among other factors, will influence claim incidence rates, claim resolution rates, and claim costs. In addition, for policies offering coverage for disability or long-term care at advanced ages, the level and pattern of mortality rates at advanced ages will impact overall benefit costs. Reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line. Additionally, in any period and over time, our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long-term assumptions, either singularly or collectively, and these variances may offset each other. We test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long-term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time. Therefore, while it is possible to evaluate the sensitivity of overall adequacy results in our reserves based upon a change in each individual assumption, the actual impacts of changes to a variety of underlying assumptions must be considered in the aggregate by product line in order to judge the overall potential implications to reserve adequacy. The following section presents an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions, in aggregate, for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for, either favorable or unfavorable.

Trends in Key Assumptions

Generally, we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time. We have historically experienced an increase in our group long-term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period and believe claim incidence trends may continue to somewhat follow general economic conditions and demographics of the general workforce. 

Claim incidence rates for Unum US group long-term disability were generally consistent in 2019 compared to the prior year.

In 2019, both short-term and long-term interest rates decreased. The long-term interest rates supporting the majority of our lines of business remain below historical norms. The assumptions we used to discount reserves during this period were slightly lower for certain of our product lines. Reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims are periodically adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns. Changes in our average discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long-duration investment portfolios which support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business. 

Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period, both favorably and unfavorably. Claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions. These rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately. Claim resolution rates in our Unum US group long-term disability product line and in our Closed Block individual disability product line have exhibited some variability over the last several years. Relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business, actual quarterly rates during 2018 and 2019 have varied between +8 and -12 percent in our Closed Block individual disability line of business. Actual quarterly rates during 2018 and 2019 have varied by +3 and -3 percent in our Unum US group long-term disability line of business. Claim resolution rates 

43

for our group long-term disability product line have generally exhibited an increasing trend. On an annual basis for the years 2017 to 2019, our overall claim resolution rates were fairly consistent with or slightly favorable to our long-term assumptions. 

We monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate. In our estimation, scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions, when modeled together in aggregate, could produce potential results as illustrated in the chart below. The major contributor to the variance for both the Unum US group long-term disability line of business and the Closed Block individual disability line of business is the claim resolution rate. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition to our Unum US group long-term disability and Closed Block individual disability lines of business, we consider variability in our reserve assumptions related to long-term care policy reserves. These reserves are held under the gross premium valuation method with assumptions established during the third quarter of 2018, the date of the latest loss recognition. Assumptions for policy reserves do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient. As such, positive developments will result in the accumulation of reserve margin, while adverse developments would result in an additional reserve charge. Policy reserves for long-term care are based upon a number of key assumptions, and each assumption has various factors which may impact the long-term outcome. Key assumptions with respect to morbidity, mortality, claims incidence and resolutions, persistency, interest rates, and future premium rate increases must incorporate extended views of expectations for many years into the future. Reserves are highly sensitive to these estimates. 

During the third quarter of 2018, we completed our annual review of policy reserve adequacy for our long-term care line of business, which incorporated our most recent experience and included a review of all assumptions. The review utilized internal and external data and outside consulting firms for quality assurance and industry benchmarking. Based on our analysis, we updated our reserve assumptions as discussed in the following paragraphs. In addition, we have also included a sensitivity analysis for these assumptions for both favorable and unfavorable deviations applied throughout the entire life of the block. This sensitivity analysis was completed as of the date of our assumption update announcement in the third quarter of 2018 and will not be updated unless reserves are again determined to be deficient in the future. 

‚Ä¢We updated our active policy termination assumptions, which are affected by both policyholder mortality and lapses. We aligned our mortality assumptions with industry data based on a 2012 individual annuitant mortality industry table, adjusted for our experience in earlier policy durations. We also lowered our lapse assumptions for individual policies based on emerging company experience, which resulted in an ultimate lapse rate of 0.25 percent. A six percent unfavorable change in the active policy termination assumption would result in approximately a $330 million decrease to reserve margin and a six percent favorable change would result in approximately a $320 million increase to reserve margin.

‚Ä¢We updated our claims incidence assumptions to consider both the elevated claim levels that we have recently experienced as well as longer term experience based on our analysis of numerous claim factors, including variations by age, gender, product, premium funding method, and other factors. A 2.5 percent unfavorable change in the claim incidence assumption would result in approximately a $290 million decrease to reserve margin and a 2.5 percent favorable change would result in approximately a $300 million increase to reserve margin. 

‚Ä¢We updated our claim termination assumptions, which are primarily affected by the death, and to a lesser extent, the recovery of the insured to largely reflect our experience. A three percent unfavorable change in the claim termination assumption would result in approximately a $370 million decrease to reserve margin and a three percent favorable change would result in approximately a $360 million increase to reserve margin. 

‚Ä¢We have observed morbidity improvement in our own claims experience over a ten year period of approximately three percent per year, normalized for variables such as age and claim type. However, we believe that a longer-term view is the best way to evaluate this type of improvement. Accordingly, we updated our morbidity assumptions reflect minor improvement, one percent per year, including a partially offsetting assumption of 0.6 percent per year mortality improvement. If no improvement occurs in the morbidity and mortality assumptions, reserve margin would decrease by approximately $1 billion. If a three percent per year improvement in the morbidity and mortality assumptions occurs, reserve margin would increase by approximately $1.6 billion. 

44

‚Ä¢We updated our premium rate increase assumptions to reflect both our estimate of previously filed rate increases, informed by our historical approval rates, and our anticipated future rate filings. The impact of the update to the premium rate increase assumptions resulted in approximately a $1.4 billion decrease to reserves, of which approximately $700 million relates to currently outstanding requests pending approval with the remaining $700 million related to future rate increase submissions, with a focus on group policies, that will be completed and filed during the next several quarters. A ten percent change in the remaining premium rate increase success rate assumption would result in an approximately $140 million change in reserve margin depending on whether the change was favorable or unfavorable.

‚Ä¢We updated our discount rate assumption to reflect our expectation for the low interest rate environment to persist and our expected impact on future long-term care new money yield rates. Our updated expectation for long-term care new money yield rates assumes a rate of 5.5 percent through 2021 and then a gradual increase to 6.25 percent by 2025, when we assume no further increase. A 0.25 percent change in the new money yield rate assumption would result in an approximately $250 million change in reserve margin depending on whether the change was favorable or unfavorable. Alternatively, a 0.25 percent change in the overall assumed discount rate, which includes the new money yield rate assumption, would impact the reserve margin within an approximate range of $450 million to $500 million, assuming all other factors held constant. 

Key assumptions and related impacts are also heavily interrelated in both their outcome and in their effects on reserves. For example, changes in the view of morbidity and mortality might be mitigated by either potential future premium rate increases and/or morbidity improvements due to general improvement in health and/or medical breakthroughs. There is potentially a wide range of outcomes for each assumption and in totality. 

We believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions, in the aggregate, could result in a material impact on our reserve levels, but we record our reserves based on our long-term best estimate. Because these product lines have long-term claim payout periods, there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs, either positive or negative. We closely monitor emerging experience and use these results to inform our view of long-term assumptions. 

Deferred Acquisition Costs (DAC) 

We defer incremental direct costs associated with the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts and amortize these costs over the life of the related policies. Deferred costs include certain commissions, other agency compensation, selection and policy issue expenses, and field expenses. Acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business, such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy, are excluded from deferral. 

Approximately 89.4 percent of our DAC relates to non-interest sensitive products, and we amortize DAC for these products in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies. DAC related to interest sensitive policies is amortized over the lives of the policies in relation to the present value of estimated gross profits from surrender charges, mortality margins, investment returns, and expense margins. Key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of DAC are persistency, premium income, and for our interest sensitive products, mortality margins and investment returns. We use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining our assumptions. For non-interest sensitive products, the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to the anticipated cumulative effect of policy persistency in the early years, which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy. Our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization of acquisition costs deferred during 2019 did not change materially from those used in 2018. Generally, we do not expect our key assumptions to change significantly in the short-term, and to the extent that these trends do change, we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time. 

45

The following are our current assumptions regarding the length of our amortization periods, the approximate DAC balance that remains at the end of years 3, 10, and 15 as a percentage of the cost initially deferred, and our DAC balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amortization of DAC is adjusted to reflect actual experience for assumptions which deviate compared to the anticipated experience. Any deviations from projections may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. As an example, for our non-interest sensitive products, we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected, or we may experience a slower rate of amortization if policies persist longer than projected. Our actual experience has not varied materially from our assumptions during the last three years. 

See Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our DAC accounting policy. 

Fair Value of Investments 

All of our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, and all of our unrestricted equity securities are reported at fair value. Our derivative financial instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, are reported as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. We report our investments in private equity partnerships at our share of the partnerships' net asset value per share or its equivalent (NAV), as a practical expedient for fair value. 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and therefore represents an exit price, not an entry price. The exit price objective applies regardless of our intent and/or ability to sell the asset or transfer the liability at the measurement date. We generally use valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, and to a lesser extent, the income approach. The market approach 

46

uses prices and other relevant information from market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities and the income approach converts future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount, or a discounted amount. We believe the market approach valuation technique provides more observable data than the income approach, considering the types of investments we hold. 

The degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability. Financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment utilized in measuring fair value. The market sources from which we obtain or derive the fair values of our assets and liabilities carried at market value include quoted market prices for actual trades, price quotes from third party pricing vendors, price quotes we obtain from outside brokers, discounted cash flow, and observable prices for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer. Our fair value measurements could differ significantly based on the valuation technique and available inputs.

Inputs to valuation techniques refer broadly to the assumptions that market participants use in pricing assets or liabilities, including assumptions about risk, for example, the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique used to measure fair value and/or the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. We use observable and unobservable inputs in measuring the fair value of our financial instruments. Observable inputs are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances.

Certain of our investments do not have readily determinable market prices and/or observable inputs or may at times be affected by the lack of market liquidity. For these securities, we use internally prepared valuations, including valuations based on estimates of future profitability, to estimate the fair value. We consider key assumptions, such as risk-free interest rates and risk premium adjustments, in the valuation of these types of securities. Additionally, we may obtain prices from independent third-party brokers to aid in establishing valuations for certain of these securities. Key assumptions used by us to determine fair value for these securities include risk-free interest rates, risk premiums, performance of underlying collateral (if any), and other factors involving significant assumptions which may or may not reflect those of an active market.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 9.9 percent of our fixed maturity securities were categorized as Level 1, 88.6 percent as Level 2, and 1.5 percent as Level 3. Level 1 is the highest category of the three-level fair value hierarchy classification wherein inputs are unadjusted and represent quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Level 2 category includes assets or liabilities valued using inputs (other than those included in the Level 1 category) that are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument's anticipated life. The Level 3 category is the lowest category of the fair value hierarchy and reflects the judgment of management regarding what market participants would use in pricing assets or liabilities at the measurement date using unobservable inputs to extrapolate an estimated fair value.

Rapidly changing credit and equity market conditions can materially impact the valuation of securities, and the period to period changes in value can vary significantly. 

See Note 2 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Investment Impairments

One of the significant estimates related to investments is our impairment valuation. In determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary, we evaluate the following factors: 

‚Ä¢Whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security

‚Ä¢Whether we intend to sell the security or will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis

‚Ä¢Whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments

‚Ä¢The significance of the decline in value

‚Ä¢The time period during which there has been a significant decline in value

‚Ä¢Current and future business prospects and trends of earnings

‚Ä¢The valuation of the security‚Äôs underlying collateral

‚Ä¢Relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles

‚Ä¢Market conditions

‚Ä¢Rating agency and governmental actions

‚Ä¢Bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity

‚Ä¢Adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments

‚Ä¢Changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date

‚Ä¢Any other key measures for the related security 

We evaluate available information, including the factors noted above, both positive and negative, in reaching our conclusions. In particular, we also consider the strength of the issuer‚Äôs balance sheet, its debt obligations and near term funding requirements, cash flow and liquidity, the profitability of its core businesses, the availability of marketable assets which could be sold to increase liquidity, its industry fundamentals and regulatory environment, and its access to capital markets. Although all available and applicable factors are considered in our analysis, our expectation of recovering the entire amortized cost basis of the security, whether we intend to sell the security, whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost, and whether the security is current on principal and interest payments are the most critical factors in determining whether impairments are other than temporary. The significance of the decline in value and the length of time during which there has been a significant decline are also important factors, but we generally do not record an impairment loss based solely on these two factors, since often other more relevant factors will impact our evaluation of a security.

While determining other-than-temporary impairments is a judgmental area, we utilize a formal, well-defined, and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio, supported by issuer specific research and documentation as of the end of each period. The process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other-than-temporary impairment.

We use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of our mortgage loans and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation. Mortgage loans are considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. We establish an allowance for probable losses on mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans, considering the value of the underlying collateral, the value of which is periodically assessed. Mortgage loans are not reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets unless the mortgage loan is considered impaired, in which case the impairment is recognized as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income.

48

There are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our investments for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary. These risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities:

‚Ä¢The assessment of a borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations will change. 

‚Ä¢The economic outlook, either domestic or foreign, may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated, and as such, the investment may not recover in value. 

‚Ä¢New information may become available concerning the security, such as disclosure of accounting irregularities, fraud, or corporate governance issues. 

‚Ä¢Significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry.

‚Ä¢Significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased.

‚Ä¢Adverse rating agency actions may occur.

See Notes 1 and 3 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans

We sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans for our employees, including non-qualified pension plans. The U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and benefit cost. We maintain a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees in our U.K. operation. The U.S. defined benefit pension plans were closed to new entrants on December 31, 2013, the OPEB plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2012, and the U.K. plan was closed to new entrants on December 31, 2002.

Assumptions

Our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience. Major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount (interest) rate, the long-term rate of return on plan assets, and mortality rates. We also use, as applicable, expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits, which reflects a health care cost trend rate, and the U.K. pension plan also uses expected cost of living increases to plan benefits.

The assumptions chosen for our pension and OPEB plans are reviewed annually, using a December 31 measurement date for each of our plans unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement. The discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, and mortality rate assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans. In addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions, the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and OPEB plans may change due to factors such as plan amendments, actual experience being different from our assumptions, special benefits to terminated employees, and/or changes in benefits provided under the plans. 

‚Ä¢Discount rate - This interest assumption is based on the yield derived from a portfolio of high quality fixed income corporate debt instruments that reasonably match the timing and amounts of projected future benefits for each of our retirement-related benefit plans. The rate is determined at the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our net periodic benefit cost.

‚Ä¢Long-term rate of return - This assumption is selected from a range of probable return outcomes from an analysis of the asset portfolio. The market-related value as it relates to our estimate of long-term rate of return equals the fair value of plan assets, determined as of the measurement date. The return on plan assets recognizes all asset gains and losses, including changes in fair value, through the measurement date. Our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance, evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists, and current market yields. The expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan's strategic asset allocation. The actual rate of return on plan assets is determined based on the fair value of the plan assets at the beginning and the end of the period, adjusted for contributions and benefit payments. A lower long-term rate of return on plan assets increases our net periodic benefit cost. 

Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition. We believe our investment portfolios are well 

49

diversified by asset class and sector, with no undue risk concentrations in any one category. See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of the investment portfolios for our plans.

‚Ä¢Mortality rate - This assumption reflects our best estimate, as of the measurement date, of the life expectancies of plan participants in order to determine the expected length of time for benefit payments. We derive our assumptions from industry mortality tables. 

The weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs for the years ended December 31 are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following illustrates the sensitivity of the below items to a 50 basis point change in the discount rate or the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Benefit Obligation and Fair Value of Plan Assets

During 2019, the fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan increased $145.1 million, or 10.0 percent due to a favorable return on assets which resulted in a gain of approximately 19.4 percent, partially offset by the payment of benefits and expenses. The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan increased ¬£20.5 million, or 12.1 percent, due primarily to a favorable return on assets which resulted in a gain of approximately 14.2 percent. Although our rate of return on plan assets for 2019 exceeded our assumptions used in the measurement of our net periodic benefit costs, we believe our assumptions appropriately reflect the impact of the current economic environment and our expectations for the future investment returns based on the plan's asset allocation.  

As of December 31, 2019, our pension and OPEB plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss of $747.4 million and an unrecognized prior service credit of $2.1 million, which together represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses as well as the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense. The unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans, which is $758.5 million at December 31, 2019, will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of the plan, which is approximately 26 years for the U.S. plan and 32 years for the U.K. plan, to the extent that it exceeds the 10 percent corridor, as described below. The unrecognized net actuarial gain of $11.1 million for our OPEB plan will be amortized over the average future working life of OPEB plan participants, estimated at three years, to the extent the gain is outside of the corridor. The corridor for the pension and OPEB plans is established based on the greater of 10 percent of the plan assets or 10 percent of the benefit obligation. At December 31, 2019, $484.8 million of the actuarial loss was outside of the corridor for the U.S. plans and ¬£28.3 million was outside of the corridor for the U.K. plan. At December 31, 2019, none of the actuarial gain was outside of the corridor for the OPEB plan.

The amortization of the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss and the unrecognized prior service credit is a component of our net periodic benefit cost and equaled $18.4 million, $22.1 million, and $19.6 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

50

The fair value of plan assets in our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan was $1,600.0 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $1,454.9 million at December 31, 2018. The plan was in an underfunded position of $300.8 million and $294.2 million at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. This year-over-year change was due primarily to the increase in period benefit obligations due to the decrease in discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns. 

The fair value of plan assets in our U.K. pension plan was ¬£190.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to ¬£170.2 million at December 31, 2018. The U.K. pension plan was in an underfunded position of ¬£3.1 million at December 31, 2019 and an overfunded position of ¬£4.7 million at December 31, 2018. This year-over-year change was due primarily to the increase in period benefit obligations due to the decrease in discount rate, partially offset by higher than expected asset returns. 

The fair value of plan assets in our OPEB plan was $9.9 million and $10.1 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These assets represent life insurance contracts to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our OPEB plan. Our OPEB plan represents a non-vested, non-guaranteed obligation, and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits, which are comprised of retiree life, medical, and dental benefits. It is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our OPEB plan. 

See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Income Taxes 

We provide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Our accounting for income taxes represents our best estimate of various events and transactions. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions, both domestic and foreign. The amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability.

We record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Significant judgment is required in determining valuation allowances. In evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we determine that we most likely will not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an increase to the valuation allowance is charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. Likewise, if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets will be realized, the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed.

In establishing a liability for unrecognized tax benefits, assumptions are made in determining whether, and to what extent, a tax position may be sustained. GAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. The evaluation of a tax position is a two step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. The second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met.  If a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured, the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective.

Changes in tax laws, tax regulations, or interpretations of such laws or regulations, could have an impact on our provision for income tax and our effective tax rate, which could significantly affect the amounts reported in our financial statements. The TCJA did not significantly change our process for evaluating the above items. 

In connection with the TCJA, we recognized a tax benefit of $97.9 million in 2017 related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities associated with our U.S. operations to the newly enacted U.S. corporate tax rate and a tax expense of $66.4 million resulting from the tax on undistributed and previously untaxed foreign earnings and profits. During 2018, we continued to refine our calculations during the one-year measurement period after the enactment date as allowed by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 and increased our provisional Repatriation Tax estimate by $11.5 million to $77.9 million.

See "Regulation" contained herein in Item 1. See Note 7 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 

Contingent Liabilities

On a quarterly basis, we review relevant information with respect to litigation and contingencies to be reflected in our consolidated financial statements. An estimated loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. It is possible that our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period could be materially affected by an ultimate unfavorable outcome of pending litigation or regulatory matters depending, in part, on our results of operations or cash flows for the particular period. See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Accounting Developments

For information on new accounting standards and the impact, if any, on our financial position or results of operations, see Note 1 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8.

Consolidated Operating Results 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fluctuations in exchange rates, particularly between the British pound sterling and the U.S. dollar for our U.K. operations, have an effect on our consolidated financial results. In periods when the pound weakens relative to the preceding period, translating pounds into dollars decreases current period results relative to the prior period. In periods when the pound strengthens, translating pounds into dollars increases current period results relative to the prior period. 

The weighted average pound/dollar exchange rate for our Unum UK line of business was 1.279, 1.336, and 1.290 for the years ended 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. If the 2018 and 2017 results for our U.K. operations had been translated at the 2019 exchange rate, our adjusted operating revenue by segment would have been lower by approximately $28 million and $5 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Additionally, our adjusted operating income would have been lower by approximately $5 million and $1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. However, it is important to distinguish between translating and converting foreign currency. Except for a limited number of transactions, we do not actually convert pounds into dollars. As a result, we view foreign currency translation as a financial reporting item and not a reflection of operations or profitability in the U.K. 

We continued to report year-over-year premium growth in 2019 and 2018 in each of our principal operating business segments, driven by growth in the in-force block resulting from higher prior period sales growth, the continued expansion of our dental and vision products, the addition of our Unum Poland product, and generally stable persistency. Premium income continues to decline, as expected, in our Closed Block segment. 

Net investment income was slightly lower in 2019 relative to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in the yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. Net investment income in 2018 was generally consistent with 2017, with an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, offset by a decline in the yield on invested assets.

We recognized $25.3 million of other-than-temporary impairment losses on fixed maturity securities in net realized investment gains and losses in 2019 compared to $17.5 million and $8.1 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Also included in net realized investment gains and losses were changes in the fair value of an embedded derivative in a modified coinsurance arrangement, which resulted in realized gains (losses) of $8.3 million, $(15.2) million, and $30.8 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion.

Other income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to growth in our fee-based service products in our Unum US segment, which include leave management services and administrative services only (ASO) business.

Overall benefits experience was favorable in 2019 relative to the prior periods, with a consolidated benefit ratio of 80.0 percent in 2019 compared to 89.3 percent in 2018 and 82.1 percent in 2017. Excluding the 2018 long term care reserve increase and the 2017 unclaimed death benefits reserve increase, the benefit ratios for 2018 and 2017 were 80.9 percent and 81.6 percent, respectively. The underlying benefits experience for each of our operating business segments is discussed more fully in "Segment Results" contained herein in this Item 7. 

Commissions increased year-over-year in 2019 and 2018 driven primarily by sales growth. The deferral of acquisition costs was lower during 2019 relative to 2018 due primarily to a shift in product mix that resulted in lower first-year commissions and a lower corresponding deferral of acquisition costs in the Unum US supplemental and voluntary product line. The deferral of acquisition costs was higher in 2018 relative to 2017 driven primarily by overall sales growth. Growth in the level of the deferred asset in our Unum US and Colonial Life segments resulted in higher amortization of deferred acquisition costs year-over-year in 2019 and 2018. Also contributing to the increase in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2019 was a higher level of policy terminations experienced in the Unum US voluntary benefits product line and the impact of the prospective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions in certain of our Colonial life products. 

Cost related to early retirement of debt includes costs associated with the purchase and retirement of $433.1 million aggregate liquidation/principal amount of our outstanding capital and debt securities. Interest and debt expense increased year-over-year in 2019 and 2018 due primarily to a higher level of outstanding debt. See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion. 

Other expenses, including compensation expense, increased in each of the years presented above due to operational investments in our business which was balanced with our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies. Included in other expenses for 2017 is a $20.6 million loss from a guaranty fund assessment related to an unaffiliated insurer that was declared insolvent. 

Our effective income tax rate for 2019 was 20.4 percent, compared to 16.6 percent in 2018 and 29.2 percent in 2017. Our 2019 and 2018 effective tax rates differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21 percent due to favorable tax credits, with additional favorable adjustments in 2018 related to our prior year tax return. The TCJA was enacted in December 2017 and stipulated a reduction of the U.S. statutory rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective in 2018. Our effective tax rate for 2017 was favorably impacted by the enactment of the TCJA, which reduced the net deferred tax liability and was partially offset by the Deemed Repatriation Tax.

Consolidated Sales Results

Shown below are sales results for our three principal operating business segments. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Sales shown in the preceding chart generally represent the annualized premium income on new sales which we expect to receive and report as premium income during the next 12 months following or beginning in the initial quarter in which the sale is reported, depending on the effective date of the new sale. Sales do not correspond to premium income reported as revenue in accordance with GAAP. This is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium income over a 12 month period, while premium income reported in our financial statements is reported on an "as earned" basis rather than an annualized basis and also includes renewals and persistency of in-force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales.

Sales, persistency of the existing block of business, employment and salary growth, and the effectiveness of a renewal program are indicators of growth in premium income. Trends in new sales, as well as existing market share, also indicate the potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price levels and new product offerings. Sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions.

See "Segment Results" as follows for a discussion of sales by segment.

Segment Results

Our reporting segments are comprised of the following: Unum US, Unum International, Colonial Life, Closed Block, and Corporate. Financial information for each of our reporting segments is as follows. 

In describing our results, we may at times note certain items and exclude the impact on financial ratios and metrics to enhance the understanding and comparability of our operational performance and the underlying fundamentals, but this exclusion is not an indication that similar items may not recur. We also measure and analyze our segment performance on the basis of "adjusted operating revenue" and "adjusted operating income" or "adjusted operating loss", which differ from total revenue and income before income tax as presented in our consolidated statements of income due to the exclusion of net realized investment gains and losses and certain other items. These performance measures are in accordance with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, but they should not be viewed as a substitute for total revenue, income before income tax, or net income. See "Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures" contained herein in this Item 7.

Unum US Segment

The Unum US segment is comprised of group long-term and short-term disability insurance, which includes our medical stop-loss product as well as our fee-based leave management services and ASO business, group life and accidental death and dismemberment products, and supplemental and voluntary lines of business, which are comprised of individual disability, voluntary benefits, and dental and vision products.

We had goodwill of $8.9 million at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment. 

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017, driven primarily by growth in the in-force block due to higher prior period sales and improved persistency.

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for Unum US supplemental and voluntary product lines.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

62

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income increased compared to 2018 driven by prior period sales growth and the continued expansion of our dental and vision product line, partially offset by unfavorable persistency. Net investment income was lower compared to 2018 due to lower miscellaneous investment income and a decline in yield on invested assets, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets. 

Benefits experience for the individual disability product line was slightly less favorable compared to 2018 due to less favorable mortality experience, mostly offset by lower claims incidence and favorable claim recovery experience. Benefits experience for voluntary benefits was favorable compared to 2018 due primarily to the release of active life reserves resulting from a higher level of policy terminations during 2019. Benefits experience for the dental and vision product line was unfavorable compared to 2018 driven by higher claims utilization.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a shift in product mix that resulted in lower first-year commissions and a lower corresponding deferral of acquisition costs, partially offset by higher sales in the dental and vision product line. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased in 2019 relative to 2018 due primarily to the impact of a higher level of policy terminations, particularly in the voluntary benefits product line. Our other expense ratio improved relative to 2018 due to growth in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies balanced with operational investments in our business.

We had goodwill of $271.1 million at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment. 

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Premium income increased compared to 2017 driven by higher sales, including dental and vision where we continue to expand its distribution, partially offset by unfavorable persistency. Net investment income was slightly lower compared to 2017 due to a decline in yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets. Other income declined relative to 2017 due to the expected decline in surrender fees as our interest sensitive life products mature.

Benefits experience for the individual disability product line compared to 2017 was less favorable due to a reserve release of $19.5 million resulting from our 2017 annual reserve adequacy update that did not recur and unfavorable 2018 claims activity, partially offset by favorable mortality experience. Benefits experience for voluntary benefits was favorable compared to 2017 due primarily to the previously discussed 2017 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. Excluding this reserve increase, benefits experience was favorable across most of our voluntary product lines. Benefits experience for the dental and vision product line was favorable compared to 2017 and was within our expectations.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher compared to 2017 due primarily to sales growth. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased year over year due to growth in the level of the deferred asset.

Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018 

Group sales declined slightly compared to 2018 due to lower new customer sales in both the core market, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 2,000 employees, and the large case market, partially offset by higher sales to existing customers in both the core and large case markets and growth in our medical stop-loss product. The sales mix in the group market sector for 2019 was approximately 56 percent core market and 44 percent large case market.

Individual disability sales, which are primarily concentrated in the multi-life market, decreased compared to 2018 due to lower sales to new customers. Voluntary benefits sales decreased slightly compared to 2018, primarily driven by lower sales to new customers in the core market, partially offset by higher sales to new customers in the large case market. Dental and vision sales increased compared to 2018 driven by higher sales to both new and existing customers.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Group sales decreased compared to 2017 due to lower sales to new and existing customers in both the core and large case market segments. The sales mix in the group market sector for 2018 was approximately 59 percent core market and 41 percent large case market. 

Individual disability sales increased compared to 2017 due to higher sales to both new and existing customers. Voluntary benefits sales increased compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher sales to existing customers in both the core and large case markets, partially offset by lower sales to new customers in the large case market. Dental and vision sales increased compared to 2017 driven by higher sales to both new and existing customers resulting from continued expansion.

Segment Outlook

We remain committed to offering consumers a broad set of financial protection benefit products at the worksite. During 2020, we will continue to invest in a unique customer experience defined by simplicity, empathy, and deep industry expertise through the re-design of our processes and the increased utilization of digital capabilities and technology to enhance enrollment, underwriting, and claims processing. In addition, we will continue to focus on the expansion of our portfolio of products. In particular, we believe our significant investment in leave management services will allow for substantial growth opportunities, particularly with larger employers, and stronger persistency in our core products. With respect to smaller employers, we will continue to enhance our distribution model and provide comprehensive consumer-focused products. We believe our active client management and differentiated integrated customer experience across our product lines, underpinned by strong risk management, will continue to enable us to grow our market.

We anticipate stable adjusted operating income growth and continued underlying profitability in 2020, with disciplined sales and premium growth, consistent risk management, and a continued focus on operational efficiency. The low interest rate environment continues to place pressure on our profit margins by impacting net investment income yields as well as discount rates on our insurance liabilities. Our net investment income may continue to be unfavorably impacted by fluctuations in miscellaneous investment income. As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving methodology, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate. We expect that our underwriting results in 2020 will continue at a level generally consistent with 2019. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.

Unum International Segment 

The Unum International segment is comprised of our operations in both the United Kingdom and Poland. Our Unum UK products include insurance for group long-term disability, group life, and supplemental lines of business, which includes dental, individual disability, and critical illness products. Our Unum Poland products include insurance for individual and group life with accident and health riders. Unum International's products are sold primarily through field sales personnel and independent brokers and consultants. 

Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Unum International segment. Certain prior year amounts were reclassified to conform to current year presentation. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Foreign Currency Translation

The functional currencies of Unum UK and Unum Poland are the British pound sterling and Polish zloty, respectively. Premium income, net investment income, claims, and expenses are received or paid in the functional currency, and we hold functional currency-denominated assets to support functional currency-denominated policy reserves and liabilities. We translate functional currency-denominated financial statement items into dollars for our consolidated financial reporting. We translate income statement items using an average exchange rate for the reporting period, and we translate balance sheet items using the exchange rate at the end of the period. We report unrealized foreign currency translation gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income in our consolidated balance sheets.

Fluctuations in exchange rates have an effect on Unum International's reported financial results and our consolidated financial results. In periods when the functional currency strengthens relative to the preceding period, translation increases current period

results relative to the prior period. In periods when the functional currency weakens, translation decreases current period results relative to the prior period. 

Goodwill

We had total goodwill of $44.0 million for the Unum International segment at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment.

Unum UK Operating Results

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

67

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018 

Premium income was higher compared to 2018 due to higher overall persistency, sales growth, and the impact of rate increases in the group long-term disability product line.

Net investment income was higher compared to 2018 due to higher miscellaneous investment income resulting from a higher than normal level of bond calls, and a higher level of invested assets, partially offset by a lower yield on fixed-rate bonds and lower investment income from inflation index-linked bonds, which we invest in to support the claim reserves associated with certain of our group policies that provide for inflation-linked increases in benefits. The decrease in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds was offset by a decrease in the reserves for future claim payments related to the inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies.

Benefits experience was unfavorable relative to 2018 due to unfavorable mortality experience and a reduction in the claim reserve discount rate to recognize the impact on future portfolio yields from the higher than normal level of bond calls experienced during 2019, partially offset by lower inflation-linked increases in benefits related to our group products.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher relative to 2018 due to higher sales. The amortization of acquisition costs was lower in 2019 compared to 2018 due to a decline in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was lower relative to 2018 due to higher premiums and our continued focus on expense management.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Premium income increased compared to 2017 due primarily to growth in the in-force block driven by higher persistency and rate increases in our group long-term disability product line.

Net investment income decreased compared to 2017 due primarily to a lower yield on our fixed-rate bonds, partially offset by a higher level of invested assets and higher investment income from inflation index-linked bonds. The increase in net investment income attributable to these index-linked bonds was offset by an increase in the reserves for future claim payments related to inflation index-linked group long-term disability and group life policies.

Benefits experience was consistent with 2017 as favorable claims recoveries in our group long-term disability product line were offset by unfavorable claims activity in our group life and supplemental product lines and the impact of inflation-linked increases in benefits.

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs decreased relative to 2017 due to lower sales. The amortization of acquisition costs was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 due to a decline in the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was lower relative to 2017 due to higher premiums and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

The following discussion of sales results relates only to our Unum UK product lines and is based on functional currency.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018 

Group long-term disability sales were generally consistent with 2018, with higher sales to new customers in the core market, which we define as employee groups with fewer than 500 employees, mostly offset by a decline in sales to both new and existing customers in our large case market. 

Group life sales were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due to an increase in sales to new and existing customers in both our core and large case markets. 

Supplemental sales were higher in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to higher sales in the group critical illness product line.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Group long-term disability sales decreased compared to 2017 due to lower sales to new customers in the large case market, partially offset by higher sales to both new and existing customers in our core market and higher sales to existing customers in our large case market.

Group life sales decreased compared to 2017 due to lower sales to new and existing customers in our large case market, partially offset by an increase in sales to new and existing customers in our core market.

Supplemental sales increased compared to 2017 due primarily to an increase in the group critical illness product line, partially offset by a decline in dental product sales.

Segment Outlook

We are committed to driving growth in the Unum International segment and will build on the capabilities that we believe will generate growth and profitability in our businesses. Within our Unum UK line of business, expanding our group long-term disability market position remains a priority. In addition, we will continue to focus on increasing participation levels in the large case segment while also developing new distribution and services to reach new small case clients. We will also continue the implementation of price increases and will maintain our disciplined sales approach. Within our Unum Poland line of business, we will leverage our U.S. and U.K. expertise to grow existing distribution channels and expand our current product offerings. We continue to invest in digital capabilities, technology, and product enhancements which we believe will drive sustainable growth.

Negotiations following the recent withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU will continue to generate uncertainty in the U.K. economy. This uncertainty may continue to pressure our growth expectations in the near-term and may also lead to a higher rate of claim incidence, lower levels of claim recoveries, or lower claim discount rates, however, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities as these negotiations are resolved and the operating environment improves. As part of our continued pricing discipline and our reserving strategy, we continuously monitor emerging interest rate experience and adjust our pricing and reserve discount rates, as appropriate. We will likely continue to experience volatility in net investment income and our benefit ratio due to fluctuations in the level of inflation in the U.K., however, we do not expect this to have a significant impact on adjusted operating income. There are no indications currently that capital requirements for our U.K. operations will change due to the recent withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU, but economic conditions may in the near term cause volatility in our solvency ratios. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly to respond to external challenges.

Colonial Life Segment 

The Colonial Life segment includes insurance for accident, sickness, and disability products, which includes our dental and vision products, life products, and cancer and critical illness products issued primarily by Colonial Life & Accident Insurance Company and marketed to employees, on both a group and an individual basis, at the workplace through an independent contractor agency sales force and brokers.

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018

Premium income increased compared to 2018 as a result of growth in the in-force block resulting from prior period sales growth, which includes the expansion of our dental and vision products, offset partially by lower persistency. Net investment income decreased relative to the prior year due to a lower yield on invested assets and lower miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by an increase in the level of invested assets.

Benefits experience was generally consistent with 2018, with favorable experience in the life line of business mostly offset by unfavorable experience in the accident, sickness, and disability and cancer and critical illness product lines. 

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were generally consistent with 2018 due to stable sales results relative to the prior year. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased compared to the prior year due primarily to overall growth in the level of the deferred asset and the impact of the prospective unlocking for future experience relative to assumptions for our interest-sensitive voluntary life products. The other expense ratio improved relative to 2018 due to an increase in premium income and our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

We had goodwill of $27.7 million at December 31, 2019, none of which is currently believed to be at risk for future impairment. 

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017

Premium income increased compared to 2017 as a result of sales growth. Net investment income increased relative to 2017 due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets.

Benefits experience was favorable compared to 2017 due to the previously discussed 2017 reserve increase for unclaimed death benefits. Excluding this reserve increase, benefits experience was consistent with 2017. 

Commissions and the deferral of acquisition costs were higher relative to 2017 due to sales growth. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs increased compared to 2017 due primarily to growth in the level of the deferred asset. The other expense ratio was higher relative to 2017 due to costs related to our territory expansion initiatives, investments in our business, and the roll-out of our dental and vision products.

Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018 

Commercial market sales decreased primarily due to lower new customer account sales in both the core market, which we define as accounts with fewer than 1,000 employees, and the large case market, partially offset by higher existing customer account sales in the core market and the continued expansion of our dental and vision products. The increase in our public sector market for 2019 was driven by an increase in both new and existing customer account sales. The number of new accounts and average new case size decreased 4.5 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Sales were higher in 2018 compared to 2017 due to growth in both new and existing customer account sales and the expansion of our dental and vision products. Commercial market sales increased primarily due to higher new and existing customer account sales in the core market and higher existing sales in the large case market. The slight increase in our public sector market for 2018 was primarily driven by an increase in existing customer account sales, partially offset by a decrease in new account sales. The number of new accounts increased 9.8 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, while the average new case size decreased 4.0 percent.

Segment Outlook

We remain committed to providing employees and their families with simple, modern, and personal benefit solutions. During 2020, we will continue to focus on expanding our distribution system through the growth and development of our agency sales force and establishing effective broker partnerships. We will also continue to invest in new solutions and digital capabilities to enhance the customer experience for our business partners and further improve productivity. We will continue to focus on accelerating growth in our business through territory growth, persistency investments, and increased participation rates. We believe our distribution system, customer service capabilities, the continued expansion of our new dental products, and ability to serve all market sizes position us well for future growth. 

We expect stable adjusted operating income growth in 2020, with sales and premium growth, consistent benefits experience, and a continued focus on operational efficiency balanced with our continued investments in future growth. The lower interest rate environment will continue to have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins, and volatility in miscellaneous investment income is likely to continue. While we believe our underlying profitability will remain strong, current economic conditions and increasing competition in the voluntary workplace market are seen as external risks to achievement of our business plans. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.

Closed Block Segment

The Closed Block segment consists of group and individual long-term care, individual disability, and other insurance products no longer actively marketed. We discontinued offering individual long-term care in 2009 and group long-term care in 2012. Individual disability in this segment generally consists of policies we sold prior to the mid-1990s and entirely discontinued selling in 2004. Other insurance products include group pension, individual life and corporate-owned life insurance, reinsurance pools and management operations, and other miscellaneous product lines. 

Operating Results

Shown below are financial results and key performance indicators for the Closed Block segment. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

74

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018 

Premium income for long-term care was generally consistent with the prior year, with rate increases offsetting policy terminations. We continue to file requests with various state insurance departments for premium rate increases on certain of our individual and group long-term care policies which reflect assumptions as of the date of filings. In states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved, we routinely provide customers options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs. Premium income for individual disability decreased compared to 2018 due to policy terminations and maturities. 

Net investment income was higher relative to 2018 primarily due to an increase in the level of invested assets, partially offset by lower miscellaneous investment income. Other income, which includes the underlying results and associated net investment income of certain blocks of individual disability reinsured business, continues to decline due to expected terminations and maturities.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care, excluding the previously discussed reserve increase, was not comparable to 2018 due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was generally consistent with our expectations during 2019. Individual disability benefits experience was favorable relative to 2018 driven by overall favorable claims activity. 

The other expense ratio was higher than 2018 due to the expected decline in premium income for individual disability, partially offset by our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Premium income for long-term care was generally consistent with the prior year, with rate increases offsetting policy terminations. Premium income for individual disability decreased compared to 2017 due to policy terminations and maturities. 

Net investment income was higher relative to 2017 primarily due to an increase in the level of invested assets and higher miscellaneous investment income, partially offset by a decline in yield on invested assets. Other income declined due to expected terminations and maturities.

The interest adjusted loss ratio for long-term care, excluding the previously discussed reserve increase, was not comparable to 2017 due to the update in our assumptions during the third quarter of 2018, but was generally consistent with our expectations in the second half of 2018, with an interest adjusted loss ratio of 85.4 percent. Individual disability benefits experience was favorable relative to 2017 due primarily to lower claims incidence and a lower average size of new claims. 

The other expense ratio was slightly higher than 2017 due to the expected decline in premium income for individual disability, partially offset by our continued focus on expense management and operating efficiencies.

Segment Outlook

During 2020, we will continue to execute on our well-defined strategy of implementing long-term care premium rate increases, efficient capital management, improved financial analysis, and operational effectiveness. We will continue to explore structural options to enhance financial flexibility. Despite continued anticipated premium rate increases in our long-term care business, we expect overall premium income and adjusted operating revenue to decline over time as these closed blocks of business wind down. We will likely experience volatility in net investment income due to fluctuations of miscellaneous investment income and the increased allocation towards alternative assets in the long-term care product line portfolio. We continuously monitor key indicators to assess our risks and attempt to adjust our business plans accordingly.

Profitability of our long-tailed products is affected by claims experience related to mortality and morbidity, resolutions, investment returns, premium rate increases, and persistency. We believe that the interest adjusted loss ratios for long-term care and the individual disability lines of business will be relatively flat over the long term, but these product lines may continue to experience quarterly volatility, particularly in the near term for our long-term care product lines as our claim block matures and as we continue the implementation of premium rate increases. Specific to our long-term care line of business, which is in loss recognition and should report levels of benefits plus operating expenses that equal the gross premium reported, we expect the long term interest adjusted loss ratio to be in the 85 to 90 percent range with some quarterly volatility. Claim resolution rates, which measure the resolution of claims from recovery, deaths, settlements, and benefit expirations, are very sensitive to operational and external factors and can be volatile. Our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period. It is possible that variability in any of our reserve assumptions, including, but not limited to, interest rates, mortality, morbidity, resolutions, premium rate increases, benefit change elections, and persistency, could result in a material impact on the adequacy of our reserves, including adjustments to reserves established under loss recognition.

Corporate Segment

The Corporate segment includes investment income on corporate assets not specifically allocated to a line of business, interest expense on corporate debt other than non-recourse debt, and certain other corporate income and expenses not allocated to a line of business. 

Operating Results 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2018 

Net investment income was lower in 2018 due primarily to both a lower yield and a lower level of invested assets. 

Interest, debt, and other expenses were higher in 2019 relative to 2018, driven primarily by costs related to the early retirement of debt, higher pension costs, and a higher level of outstanding debt, partially offset by acquisition and restructuring costs in 2018 that did not recur. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Debt‚Äù contained herein in Item 7 for further discussion.

Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2017 

Net investment income was higher relative to 2017 due primarily to an increase in the level of invested assets and a higher yield. 

Interest and other expenses were higher relative to 2017 due primarily to a higher level of outstanding debt, a higher overall rate of interest, increased acquisition-related expenses, and certain restructuring costs. Interest and other expenses for 2017 includes a $20.6 million loss incurred in 2017 from a guaranty fund assessment related to an unaffiliated insurer that was declared insolvent. See Note 14 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion on the loss from a guaranty fund assessment.

Segment Outlook

We expect to continue to generate excess capital on an annual basis through the statutory earnings in our insurance subsidiaries and believe we are well positioned with flexibility to preserve our capital strength while also continuing to return capital to our shareholders. 

77

Investments

Overview

Our investment portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector. We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations and allow us to hold our securities through periods where significant decreases in fair value occur. We believe our emphasis on risk management in our investment portfolio, including credit and interest rate management, has positioned us well and generally reduced the volatility in our results. 

We have a formal investment policy that includes overall quality and diversification objectives and establishes limits by asset class, investment rating, and single issuer. The majority of our investments are in investment-grade publicly traded securities. This ensures the desired liquidity and preserves the capital value of our portfolios, although due to the long-term nature of our insurance liabilities we are also able to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns within the limits of our investment policy. Our asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us, reviewed by the risk and finance committee of Unum Group's board of directors, and approved by the boards of directors of our insurance subsidiaries. We review our policies and guidelines annually, or more frequently if deemed necessary, and recommend adjustments as appropriate. 

See "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained herein in this Item 7 for further discussion of our valuation of investments.

Fixed Maturity Securities

The fair values and associated unrealized gains and losses of our fixed maturity securities portfolio, by industry classification, are as follows:

Fixed Maturity Securities - By Industry Classification

As of December 31, 2019

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

78

The following two tables show the length of time our investment-grade and below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities had been in a gross unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2019 and at the end of the prior four quarters. The relationships of the current fair value to amortized cost are not necessarily indicative of the fair value to amortized cost relationships for the securities throughout the entire time that the securities have been in an unrealized loss position nor are they necessarily indicative of the relationships after December 31, 2019. The decrease in the unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities during 2019 was due to a decrease in both U.S. Treasury rates and credit spreads.

Unrealized Loss on Below-Investment-Grade Fixed Maturity Securities

Length of Time in Unrealized Loss Position

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

At December 31, 2019, we held two below-investment grade fixed maturity securities with a gross unrealized loss greater than $10.0 million. One security is related to a global pharmaceutical company and had a fair value of $65.3 million and a gross unrealized loss of $11.7 million. The other security is related to a global business process automation company and had a fair value of $8.1 million and a gross unrealized loss of $11.9 million. We intend to and have the ability to continue to hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost and believe that the declines in fair value are temporary.

During the third quarter of 2019, we recognized an other-than-temporary impairment loss of $20.8 million on fixed maturity securities issued by a specialty pharmaceutical company. The company has a high level of debt, has experienced some operational issues, and is facing fines and potentially a large litigation expense, which led to our decision to no longer hold these securities to recovery of amortized cost. At the time of the impairment loss, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of more than three years. 

During the second quarter of 2019, we recognized a realized loss of $15.6 million on the sale of securities of a U.S. based oil and natural gas producer. The company has been impacted by the significant decline in energy prices, a high level of debt, and an inability to complete certain asset sales. At the time of disposition, these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years. 

We had no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from other-than-temporary impairments during 2018 or 2017 and no individual realized investment losses of $10.0 million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during 2018 or 2017. 

80

At December 31, 2019, our mortgage/asset-backed securities had an average life of 6.30 years, effective duration of 4.13 years, and a weighted average credit rating of AAA. The mortgage/asset-backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services. One of the risks involved in investing in mortgage/asset-backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment. We use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates. The timing of prepayment cash flows may also cause volatility in our recognition of investment income. We recognize investment income on these securities using a constant effective yield based on projected prepayments of the underlying loans and the estimated economic life of the securities. Actual prepayment experience is reviewed periodically, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between prepayments originally projected and the actual prepayments received and currently projected. The effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis, and the adjustment is reflected in net investment income.

As of December 31, 2019, the amortized cost and fair value of our below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities was $3,071.4 million and $3,188.5 million, respectively. Below-investment-grade securities are inherently riskier than investment-grade securities since the risk of default by the issuer, by definition and as exhibited by bond rating, is higher. Also, the secondary market for certain below-investment-grade issues can be highly illiquid. Additional downgrades may occur, but we do not anticipate any liquidity problems resulting from our investments in below-investment-grade securities, nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity. 

Fixed Maturity Securities - Foreign Exposure

Our investments in issuers in foreign countries are chosen for specific portfolio management purposes, including asset and liability management and portfolio diversification across geographic lines and sectors to minimize non-market risks. In our approach to investing in fixed maturity securities, specific investments within approved countries and industry sectors are evaluated for their market position and specific strengths and potential weaknesses. For each security, we consider the political, legal, and financial environment of the sovereign entity in which an issuer is domiciled and operates. The country of domicile is based on consideration of the issuer's headquarters, in addition to location of the assets and the country in which the majority of sales and earnings are derived. We do not have exposure to foreign currency risk, as the cash flows from these investments are either denominated in currencies or hedged into currencies to match the related liabilities. We continually evaluate our foreign investment risk exposure.

Mortgage Loans

Our mortgage loan portfolio was $2,397.0 million and $2,295.0 million on an amortized cost basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our mortgage loan portfolio is comprised entirely of commercial mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types. The incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity continues to be low. Due to conservative underwriting, we expect the level of problem loans to remain low. We held no impaired mortgage loans at December 31, 2019. We held one impaired mortgage loan at December 31, 2018 with a net realizable value of $3.4 million, net of a valuation allowance of $0.2 million. During the first quarter of 2019, the impaired mortgage loan was settled, and we recognized an additional loss of $0.1 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments

We use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage reinvestment, duration, foreign currency, and credit risks. Historically, we have utilized current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps and U.S. Treasury rates, current and forward currency swaps, forward treasury locks, currency forward contracts, forward contracts on specific fixed income securities, and credit default swaps. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held. At December 31, 2019, we had no credit exposure on derivatives. We held $24.0 million of cash collateral from our counterparties at December 31, 2019. The carrying value of fixed maturity securities posted as collateral to our counterparties was $28.6 million at December 31, 2019. We had no cash collateral posted to our counterparties at December 31, 2019. We believe that our credit risk is mitigated by our use of multiple counterparties, all of which have an investment-grade credit rating, and by our use of cross-collateralization agreements.

81

Other

Our exposure to non-current investments, defined as foreclosed real estate and invested assets which are delinquent as to interest and/or principal payments, totaled $30.5 million and $36.0 million on a fair value basis at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our investments and our derivative financial instruments.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Overview 

Our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations, principally in our insurance subsidiaries. Premium and investment income, as well as maturities and sales of invested assets, provide the primary sources of cash. Debt and/or securities offerings provide additional sources of liquidity. Cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits, costs of acquiring new business (principally commissions), operating expenses, and taxes, as well as purchases of new investments. 

We have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations. We attempt to match our asset cash flows and durations with expected liability cash flows and durations to meet the funding requirements of our business. However, deterioration in the credit market may delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner and adversely impact the price we receive for such securities, which may negatively impact our cash flows. Furthermore, if we experience defaults on securities held in the investment portfolios of our insurance subsidiaries, this will negatively impact statutory capital, which could reduce our insurance subsidiaries' capacity to pay dividends to our holding companies. A reduction in dividends to our holding companies could force us to seek external financing to avoid impairing our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders or meet our debt and other payment obligations. 

Our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments, and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities. A decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations. However, our historical pattern of benefits paid to revenues is generally consistent, even during cycles of economic downturns, which serves to minimize liquidity risk.

The liquidity requirements of the holding company Unum Group include common stock dividends, interest and debt service, acquisitions, and ongoing investments in our businesses. Unum Group's liquidity requirements are met by assets held by Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies, dividends from primarily our insurance subsidiaries, and issuance of common stock, debt, or other capital securities and borrowings from existing credit facilities, as needed. As of December 31, 2019, Unum Group and our intermediate holding companies held fixed maturity securities, short-term investments, and cash of $863 million. Fixed maturity securities consisted primarily of mortgage/asset-backed securities with an average maturity of 4.4 years. Short-term investments consisted primarily of commercial paper. No significant restrictions exist on our ability to use or access funds in any of our U.S. or foreign intermediate holding companies. Dividends repatriated from our foreign subsidiaries are eligible for 100 percent exemption from U.S. income tax but may be subject to withholding tax and/or tax on foreign currency gain or loss. 

As part of our capital deployment strategy, we repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock, as authorized by our board of directors. Our current share repurchase program was approved by our board of directors in May 2019 and authorizes the repurchase of up to $750 million of common stock through November 2020, with the pace of repurchase activity to depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash, alternative uses for cash, and our stock price. This new authorization replaced the previous authorization of $750 million that was scheduled to expire in November 2019. During 2019, we repurchased 12.3 million shares at a cost of approximately $400 million. The dollar value of shares remaining under the current repurchase program was approximately $516 million at December 31, 2019. See Note 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8. 

Cash Available from Subsidiaries 

Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries depend on payments from subsidiaries to pay dividends to stockholders, to pay debt obligations, and/or to pay expenses. These payments by our insurance and non-insurance 

82

subsidiaries may take the form of dividends, operating and investment management fees, and/or interest payments on loans from the parent to a subsidiary. 

Restrictions under applicable state insurance laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to a parent company from its insurance subsidiaries in any 12-month period without prior approval by regulatory authorities. For life insurance companies domiciled in the U.S., that limitation generally equals, depending on the state of domicile, either ten percent of an insurer's statutory surplus with respect to policyholders as of the preceding year end or the statutory net gain from operations, excluding realized investment gains and losses, of the preceding year. The payment of dividends to a parent company from a life insurance subsidiary is generally further limited to the amount of unassigned funds. 

Certain of our domestic insurance subsidiaries cede blocks of business to Northwind Reinsurance Company (Northwind Re) and Fairwind Insurance Company (Fairwind), both of which are affiliated captive reinsurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States with Unum Group as the ultimate parent. The ability of Northwind Re and Fairwind to pay dividends to their respective parent companies will depend on their satisfaction of applicable regulatory requirements and on the performance of the business reinsured by Northwind Re and Fairwind. 

The ability of Unum Group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries also depends on additional factors such as RBC ratios and capital adequacy and/or solvency requirements, funding growth objectives at an affiliate level, and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings. The RBC ratios for our U.S. insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2019 are in line with our expectations and are significantly above the level that would require state regulatory action.

Unum Group and/or certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries may also receive dividends from our U.K. subsidiaries, the payment of which may be subject to applicable insurance company regulations and capital guidance in the U.K. Unum Limited is subject to the requirements of Solvency II, an EU directive, which prescribes capital requirements and risk management standards for the European insurance industry. Our European holding company is also subject to the Solvency II requirements relevant to insurance holding companies, while its subsidiaries (the Unum European Economic Area (EEA) Group), which includes Unum Limited, are subject to group supervision under Solvency II. The Unum EEA Group received approval from the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority to use its own internal model for calculating regulatory capital and also received approval for certain associated regulatory permissions including transitional relief as the Solvency II capital regime continues to be implemented. There are currently no indications that capital requirements for the Unum EEA Group will change as a result of the U.K.'s exit from the EU, but economic conditions may in the near term cause volatility in our solvency ratios.

The payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary's board of directors.

The amount available during 2019 for the payment of ordinary dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers, was approximately $995 million, of which $956.1 million was declared and paid. The amount available during 2019 from Unum Limited was approximately ¬£140 million, of which ¬£25.0 million was declared and paid to one of our U.K. holding companies. During 2019, Northwind Re paid dividends of $52.8 million to Northwind Holdings. Fairwind paid no dividends during 2019.

During 2020, we intend to maintain a level of capital in our insurance subsidiaries above the applicable capital adequacy requirements and minimum solvency margins. Although we may not utilize the entire amount of available dividends, based on applicable restrictions under current law, approximately $1,035 million is available, without prior approval by regulatory authorities, during 2020 for the payment of dividends from Unum Group's traditional U.S. insurance subsidiaries, which excludes our captive reinsurers. Approximately ¬£180 million is available for the payment of dividends from Unum Limited during 2020, subject to regulatory approval.

Insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non-insurance subsidiaries except where the non-insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by Unum Group.

83

Funding for Employee Benefit Plans

We made contributions of $68.2 million and ¬£3.4 million to our U.S. and U.K. defined contribution plans, respectively, in 2019 and expect to make contributions of approximately $75 million and ¬£4 million during 2020. We made a de minimis amount of contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and no contribution to our U.K. defined benefit pension plan during 2019. We do not expect to make any contributions to either plan during 2020. We have met all minimum pension funding requirements set forth by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act. We have estimated our future funding requirements under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and under applicable U.K. law and do not believe that any future funding requirements will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity. See Note 9 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further discussion of our employee benefit plans. 

Debt

There are no significant financial covenants associated with any of our outstanding debt obligations. We continually monitor our debt covenants to ensure we remain in compliance. We have not observed any current trends that would cause a breach of any debt covenants. 

Maturities, Purchases, and Retirement of Debt

Northwind Holdings made principal payments on its floating rate, senior secured non-recourse notes of $60.0 million in each of 2019, 2018, and 2017. 

During 2019 we purchased and retired (i) $22.8 million aggregate liquidation amount of our 7.405% capital securities due 2038; (ii) $30.3 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.190% medium-term notes due 2028; (iii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.250% senior notes due 2028; and (iv) $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.000% senior notes due 2021.

In 2018, our $200.0 million 7.00% senior unsecured notes matured.

In 2017, we purchased and retired the remaining $3.4 million of principal on our senior secured floating rate notes acquired through our purchase of Starmount.

Issuance of Debt 

In September 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.500% senior notes due 2049. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt. 

In June 2019, we issued $400.0 million of 4.000% senior notes due 2029. The notes are callable at or above par and rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated debt.

In 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.25% junior subordinated notes due 2058. The notes are redeemable at or above par on or after June 15, 2023 and rank equally in the right of payment with our other junior subordinated debt securities.

Credit Facilities

In April 2019, we amended the terms of our existing five-year unsecured revolving credit facility, increasing it from $400.0 million to $500.0 million. The credit facility, which was previously set to expire in 2021, was extended through April 2024. Under the terms of the amended agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $700.0 million, up from the previous amount of $600.0 million. We also may request, on up to two occasions, that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At December 31, 2019, letters of credit totaling $0.6 million had been issued from the credit facility, but there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Also in April 2019, we separately entered into a three-year, $100.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a different syndicate of lenders, which is set to expire in April 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, we may request that the credit facility be increased up to $140.0 million. We also may request that the lenders' commitment termination dates be extended by one year. The credit facility provides for the issuance of letters of credit subject to certain terms and limitations. At 

84

December 31, 2019, there have been no letters of credit issued from the credit facility and there were no borrowed amounts outstanding.

Borrowings under the credit facilities are for general corporate uses and are subject to financial covenants, negative covenants, and events of default that are customary. The two primary financial covenants include limitations based on our leverage ratio and consolidated net worth. We are also subject to covenants that limit subsidiary indebtedness. The credit facilities provide for borrowings at an interest rate based either on the prime rate or LIBOR.

Shelf Registration

We filed a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2017 to issue various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, depository shares, stock purchase contracts, units and warrants. The shelf registration enables us to raise funds from the offering of any securities covered by the shelf registration as well as any combination thereof, subject to market conditions and our capital needs.

See Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our debt.

Commitments

The following table summarizes contractual obligations and our reinsurance recoverable by period as of December 31, 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Short-term and long-term debt includes contractual principal and interest payments and therefore exceeds the amount shown in the consolidated balance sheets.

Policyholder liability maturities and the related reinsurance recoverable represent the projected payout of the current in-force policyholder liabilities and the expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties 

85

as to the timing and amount of claim payments. We utilize extensive liability modeling to project future cash flows from the in-force business. The primary assumptions used to project future cash flows are claim incidence rates for mortality and morbidity, claim resolution rates, persistency rates, and interest rates. These cash flows are discounted to determine the current value of the projected claim payments. The timing and amount of payments on policyholder liabilities may vary significantly from the projections above.

Pensions and OPEB commitments relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans for our employees, including our non-qualified pension plan. Pension plan obligations, other than the non-qualified plan, represent our contributions to the pension plans and are projected based on the expected future minimum contributions as required under current U.S. and U.K. legislative funding requirements. Non-qualified pension plan and other postretirement benefit obligations represent the expected benefit payments related to these plans which we expect to pay, as incurred, from our general assets.

Miscellaneous liabilities include commissions due and accrued, deferred compensation liabilities, contingent considerations, state premium taxes payable, amounts due to reinsurance companies, legally binding commitments to fund investments, obligations to return unrestricted cash collateral to our securities lending and derivative counterparties, and various other liabilities that represent contractual obligations. Obligations where the timing of the payment is uncertain are included in the one year or less category. 

See "Critical Accounting Estimates" contained herein in this Item 7 and Notes 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 15 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information on our various commitments and obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Purchase obligations include commitments of $629.8 million to fund certain of our investments. These are included in the preceding table based on the expiration date of the commitments. The funds are due upon satisfaction of contractual notice from appropriate external parties and may or may not be funded. Also included are obligations with outside parties for computer data processing services, software maintenance agreements, and consulting services. The aggregate obligation remaining under these agreements was $54.2 million at December 31, 2019. 

As part of our regular investing strategy, we receive collateral from unaffiliated third parties through transactions which include both securities lending and short-term agreements to purchase securities with the agreement to resell them at a later specified date. For both types of transactions, we require that a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the securities loaned or securities purchased under repurchase agreements be maintained as collateral. Generally, cash is received as collateral under these agreements. In the event that securities are received as collateral, we are not permitted to sell or re-post them. We also post our fixed maturity securities as collateral to unaffiliated third parties through transactions including both securities lending and short-term agreements to sell securities with the agreement to repurchase them at a later specified date. See "Transfers of Financial Assets" as follows for further discussion. 

To help limit the credit exposure of derivatives, we enter into master netting agreements with our counterparties whereby contracts in a gain position can be offset against contracts in a loss position. We also typically enter into bilateral, cross-collateralization agreements with our counterparties to help limit the credit exposure of the derivatives. These agreements require the counterparty in a loss position to submit acceptable collateral with the other counterparty in the event the net loss position meets or exceeds an agreed upon amount. Credit exposure on derivatives is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position, including accrued interest receivable less collateral held. At December 31, 2019, we had no credit exposure on derivatives. We held cash collateral from our counterparties of $24.0 million at December 31, 2019 and had posted fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of $28.6 million as collateral to our counterparties. 

See Notes 3 and 4 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for additional information. 

Transfers of Financial Assets 

Our investment policy permits us to lend fixed maturity securities to unaffiliated financial institutions in short-term securities lending agreements, which increases our investment income with minimal risk. We account for all of our securities lending agreements and repurchase agreements as secured borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we did not hold cash collateral from securities lending agreements. The average balance for securities lending agreements which were collateralized by cash during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.9 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $5.9 million. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had $186.5 million of off-balance sheet securities lending agreements which were collateralized by securities that we were neither permitted to sell nor control. The average balance of these off-balance sheet 

86

transactions during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $189.5 million, and the maximum amount outstanding at any month end was $274.5 million.

To manage our cash position more efficiently, we may enter into repurchase agreements with unaffiliated financial institutions. We generally use repurchase agreements as a means to finance the purchase of invested assets or for short-term general business purposes until projected cash flows become available from our operations or existing investments. We had no repurchase agreements outstanding at December 31, 2019, nor did we utilize any repurchase agreements during 2019. Our use of repurchase agreements and securities lending agreements can fluctuate during any given period and will depend on our liquidity position, the availability of long-term investments that meet our purchasing criteria, and our general business needs. 

Certain of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are members of regional Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB). As of December 31, 2019, we owned $18.5 million of FHLB common stock and had no outstanding advances from the regional FHLBs.

Consolidated Cash Flows

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Cash Flows

Operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income, offset by payments of claims, commissions, expenses, and income taxes. Premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales, but on policy renewals and growth of existing business, renewal price increases, and persistency. Investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and capital and on the earned yield. The level of commissions and operating expenses is attributable to the level of sales and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business as well as the maintenance of existing business. The level of paid claims is affected partially by the growth and aging of the block of business and also by the general economy, as previously discussed in the operating results by segment.

The variance in the change in insurance reserves and liabilities to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows for 2018 was due primarily to the 2018 reserve increase for our long-term care line of business.

Investing Cash Flows 

Investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments. Investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments. Our investment strategy is to match the cash flows and durations of our assets with the cash flows and durations of our liabilities to meet the funding requirements of our business. When market opportunities arise, we may sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the yield and credit quality of our portfolio. We may at times also sell selected securities and reinvest the proceeds to improve the duration matching of our assets and liabilities and/or re-balance our portfolio. As a result, sales before maturity may vary from period to period. The sale and purchase of short-term investments is influenced by proceeds received from issuance of debt, our securities lending program, and by the amount of cash which is at times held in short-term investments to facilitate the availability of cash to fund the purchase of appropriate long-term investments, repay maturing debt, and/or to fund our capital deployment program. Our cash flows for 2018 include cash outflows, net of cash acquired, of $145.4 million related to all of our acquisitions during the year. 

See Notes 3 and 13 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.

Financing Cash Flows

Financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt, repurchase of common stock, and dividends paid to stockholders. 

During 2019, we purchased and retired $433.1 million aggregate liquidation/principal amount of our outstanding capital and debt securities, including debt repurchase costs of $25.9 million for a total cash outflow of $459.0 million. During 2018, our $200.0 million 7.00% senior unsecured notes matured. During 2017, we purchased and retired the remaining $3.4 million of principal on our senior secured floating rate notes acquired through our purchase of Starmount. During each of the years 2019, 2018, and 2017 we made principal payments of $60.0 million on our senior secured non-recourse notes issued by Northwind Holdings.

During 2019, we issued $450.0 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2049 and $400.0 million of 4.00% senior notes due 2029 and received total proceeds of $841.9 million. During 2018, we issued $300.0 million of 6.25% junior subordinated notes due 2058 and received total proceeds of $290.7 million.

Cash used to repurchase shares of Unum Group's common stock during 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $400.3 million, $356.2 million, and $401.8 million, respectively. During 2019, 2018, and 2017 we paid dividends of $229.2 million, $215.6 million, and $196.0 million, respectively, to holders of Unum Group's common stock.

See "Debt" contained herein in this Item 7, and Notes 8 and 10 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" contained herein in Item 8 for further information.

Ratings 

AM Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P are among the third parties that assign issuer credit ratings to Unum Group and financial strength ratings to our insurance subsidiaries. We compete based in part on the financial strength ratings provided by rating agencies. A downgrade of our financial strength ratings can be expected to adversely affect us and could potentially, among other things, adversely affect our relationships with distributors of our products and services and retention of our sales force, negatively impact persistency and new sales, particularly large case group sales and individual sales, and generally adversely affect our ability to compete. A downgrade in the issuer credit rating assigned to Unum Group can be expected to adversely affect our cost of capital or our ability to raise additional capital.

The table below reflects the outlook as well as the issuer credit ratings for Unum Group and the financial strength ratings for each of our traditional insurance subsidiaries as of the date of this filing.

NR = not rated

We maintain an ongoing dialogue with the four rating agencies that evaluate us in order to inform them of progress we are making regarding our strategic objectives and financial plans as well as other pertinent issues. A significant component of our 

88

communications involves our annual review meeting with each of the four agencies. We hold other meetings throughout the year regarding our business, including, but not limited to, quarterly updates. 

AM Best, Fitch, Moody's, and S&P affirmed their ratings for our domestic insurance subsidiaries and issuer credit ratings for Unum Group during 2019. There have been no other changes in any of the rating agencies' outlooks or ratings during 2019 or in 2020 prior to the date of this filing.

Agency ratings are not directed toward the holders of our securities and are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities. Each rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be regarded as an independent assessment, not conditional on any other rating. Given the dynamic nature of the ratings process, changes by these or other rating agencies may or may not occur in the near-term. Based on our ongoing dialogue with the rating agencies concerning our insurance risk profile, our financial flexibility, our operating performance, and the quality of our investment portfolio, we do not expect any negative actions from any of the four rating agencies related to either Unum Group's current issuer credit ratings or the financial strength ratings of our insurance subsidiaries. However, in the event that we are unable to meet the rating agency specific guideline values to maintain our current ratings, including but not limited to maintenance of our capital management metrics at the threshold values stated and maintenance of our financial flexibility and operational consistency, we could be placed on a negative credit watch, with a potential for a downgrade to both our issuer credit ratings and our financial strength ratings.
