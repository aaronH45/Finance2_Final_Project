Corporate Investments

Hemlock Semiconductor Group (“HSG”)

In 2016, Corning realigned its ownership interest in Dow Corning, exchanging its 50% interest in the joint venture between Corning and Dow Chemical for a newly formed company that holds a 49.9% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor LLC and a 40.25% interest in Hemlock Semiconductor Operations LLC which are recorded as equity method investments of Corning and are affiliated companies of HSG. HSG manufactures polysilicon products for the semiconductor and solar industries. HSG’s solar business primarily serves the solar power panel industry. 

In prior years, HSG’s solar and semiconductor customers entered into long-term “take or pay” contracts which included up-front cash payments to secure capacity. During the last few years, and more significantly in 2019, the solar power panel industry experienced significant over-capacity in the market, resulting in declining sales volumes and market prices. As a result, HSG’s solar business experienced lower market penetration, overall price declines, and settled contracts with customers that had committed volume and fixed pricing above the current market price. While

Index

these settlements positively impacted HSG’s cash flow in 2019, they reduced expectations for future sales in HSG’s solar business.

Due to the adverse change in HSG’s solar business, HSG was required to assess the recoverability of its long-lived assets in the fourth quarter. Based on this assessment, HSG determined that the carrying values of HSG’s solar asset group significantly exceeded its fair values. HSG engaged a third-party appraiser to assist in determining the fair value of the assets within in the solar asset group based on the highest and best use of the asset group. As a result of the fair value determination, HSG recognized a pre-tax asset impairment charge of $916 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Corning’s share of the pre-tax impairment was $369 million. 

Due to the adverse changes above, the carrying values of HSG’s solar business inventories were also affected resulting in an inventory write-down of $257 million for the year. Corning’s pre-tax share of the provision was $105 million. 

HSG adopted the new revenue standard on January 1, 2019 and the timing of HSG’s revenue recognition for certain remaining performance obligations measured at January 1, 2019 was deferred for recognition. This deferral reduced the carrying amount of Corning’s investment in HSG by $239 million. During the fourth quarter, a significant number of the performance obligations were satisfied and $434 million was recognized into HSG’s net income. Corning’s share of the equity earnings was $208 million.

In addition, HSG settled certain revenue contracts in the fourth quarter, resulting in settlement gains of $383 million in net income. Corning’s share of the settlement gains was $185 million. 

Additional information about corporate investments is presented in Note 6 (Investments) to the consolidated financial statements.
