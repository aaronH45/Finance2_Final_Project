ITEM 7A.QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices. To mitigate these risks, we utilize derivative financial instruments, such as foreign currency hedges. All of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position as of June 30, 2020. Actual results may differ materially.

As of June 30, 2020, we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities of $717.5 million These securities, as with all fixed income instruments, are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 bps from levels as of June 30, 2020, the fair value of the portfolio would have declined by $4.7 million.

In February 2020, March 2019 and November 2014, we issued $750.0 million, $1.20 billion and $2.50 billion, respectively, (each, a “2020 Senior Notes”, “2019 Senior Notes”, a “2014 Senior Notes”, and collectively the “Senior Notes”) aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior, unsecured long-term notes. The fair market value of long-term fixed interest rate notes is subject to interest rate risk. Generally, the fair market value of fixed interest rate notes will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise. As of June 30, 2020, the fair value and the book value of our Senior Notes were $4.01 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively, due in various fiscal years ranging from 2024 to 2050. The interest expense for the 2014 Senior Notes was subject to interest rate adjustments following downgrade of our credit ratings below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. In February 2020, S&P upgraded its credit rating of the Company to “BBB+” and revised its outlook to stable, which permanently removed interest rate adjustments and the interest rate on the 2014 Senior Notes became fixed. Unlike the 2014 Senior Notes, the interest rate for each series of the 2019 Senior Notes are not subject to such adjustments.

In November 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) for a $750.0 million five-year unsecured Revolving Credit Facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), which replaced our prior Credit Agreement. Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased in an amount up to $250.0 million in the aggregate. In November 2018, we entered into an Incremental Facility, Extension and Amendment Agreement (the “Amendment”), which amends the Credit Agreement to (a) extend the Maturity Date (the “Maturity Date”) from November 30, 2022 to November 30, 2023, (b) increase the total commitment by $250.0 million and (c) effect certain other amendments to the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Amendment. After giving effect to the Amendment, the total commitments under the Credit Agreement are $1.00 billion. As of June 30, 2020, we had outstanding $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of June 30, 2020, we elected to pay interest on the borrowed amount under the Revolving Credit Facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a spread. The spread ranges from 100 bps to 175 bps based on the adjusted credit rating. The fair value of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility is subject to interest rate risk only to the extent of the fixed spread portion of the interest rates which does not fluctuate with changes in interest rates. We are also obligated to pay an annual commitment fee of 12.5 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility which is subject to an adjustment in conjunction with our credit rating downgrades or upgrades. The annual commitment fee ranges from 10 bps to 25 bps on the daily undrawn balance of the Revolving Credit Facility, depending upon the then-effective credit rating. As of June 30, 2020, if LIBOR-based interest rates increased by 100 bps, the change would increase our annual interest expense annually by approximately $0.5 million as it relates to our borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Additionally as of June 30, 2020, if our credit ratings were downgraded to be below investment grade, the maximum potential increase to our annual commitment fee for the Revolving Credit Facility, using the highest range of the ranges discussed above, is estimated to be approximately $0.9 million. 

See Note 5 “Marketable Securities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources,” in Part II, Item 7; and Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recent market events that may affect the value of the investments in our portfolio that we held as of June 30, 2020.

As of June 30, 2020, we had net forward and option contracts to sell $89.4 million in foreign currency in order to hedge certain currency exposures (see Note 17 “Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). If we had entered into these contracts on June 30, 2020, the U.S. dollar equivalent would have been $88.7 million. A 10% adverse move in all currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by $39.0 million. However, if this occurred, the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount. Accordingly, we believe that, as a result of the hedging of certain of our foreign currency exposure, changes in most relevant foreign currency exchange rates should have no material impact on our results of operations or cash flows.
