Item 1. Business 

Overview 

Company Overview 

Incorporated in 1989, Stericycle protects people, safeguards communities and reduces risk through highly specialized medical and hazardous waste management and secure information services. Our team of more than 19,500 employees serves customers in the U.S. and 18 other countries with a concentration on the growing healthcare industry. We are a world-leading services company with the scale, expertise, and experience to handle complicated and behind-the-scenes essential services for waste management, regulatory compliance and information security. To our customers, team members and the communities we serve, Stericycle is a company that protects what matters. 

Segments 

Our three operating segments are North America RWCS, (formerly Domestic and Canada), (excluding Mexico prior to the divestiture of our operations there), International RWCS and Domestic CRS. 

Domestic CRS does not meet the quantitative criteria to be a separate reportable segment and therefore is included in the “All Other” reporting segment along with costs related to our corporate enabling and shared services functions. 

Financial and other information related to our reporting segments is included in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 18 - Segment Reporting.

Divestitures 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into separate arrangements to dispose of several service lines and geographies. The 2019 divestitures include: 

•  

an automated communication business in the U.K. focused on text messaging,  

•  

the North American telephone answering services business, which provided live voice and automated communication services for small healthcare providers and other small businesses,  

•  

a retail pharmaceutical returns business in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and  

•  

the regulated waste operations in Mexico and Chile. 

The 2019 revenues for these divested businesses were $114.7 million with $75.7 million from the Communication and Related Services revenue category, primarily in All Other, and $39.0 million from the Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenue category, primarily in International RWCS. 

On February 6, 2020, we entered into the Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which we have agreed to sell our Domestic Environmental Solutions business, exclusive of the Retained Business, for cash consideration of approximately $462.5 million, subject to regulatory approval and customary adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. 

The Purchase Agreement includes customary termination provisions, including if the closing of the Transaction has not occurred on or before November 6, 2020 (which may be extended until February 6, 2021, if needed, to obtain applicable regulatory approvals). Both we and Buyer have agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising from certain breaches of the Purchase Agreement and other liabilities, subject to certain limitations.

PART II 

The Domestic Environmental Solutions business generated revenue in 2019 of $559.6 million, including approximately $100.0 million related to the Retained Business, which is included in the Regulated Waste and Compliance Services revenue category within our North America RWCS segment. The ESOL Disposal Group includes approximately 2,000 employees and 60 North America locations. 

Customers 

Our offering of services appeals to a wide range of small and large business customers. The majority of our customers are healthcare businesses (hospitals, physician, and dental practices, outpatient clinics, long-term care facilities, etc.). We also provide services to retailers, manufacturers, financial services providers, professional services providers, governmental entities, and other businesses. While we manage large volumes of waste and other materials, the average volume per customer site is small.  

No single customer accounted for more than 1.4% of our total revenues, and our top ten customers collectively accounted for approximately 7.3% of total revenues. We have developed a strong and loyal customer base, with, we believe, a revenue retention rate of approximately 90% (based on our internal customer attrition analysis) and have been able to leverage these customer relationships to provide additional services. We use several different contracts across our services lines and terms vary depending upon the customer’s service requirements, types of services, and geographies. 

As of December 31, 2019, regulated waste and compliance services are provided to customers in the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal, the Republic of Korea, Romania, Spain, and the U.K. Secure information destruction services under the Shred-it® brand are provided in the U.S., Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Singapore, and the U.K. Secure information destruction service are also provided in the United Arab Emirates through a joint venture. Manufacturing and industrial hazardous waste services are predominately provided in the U.S., Canada, and Latin America. The vast majority of services for CRS are provided within the U.S. and Canada. 

Facilities and Fleet  

Our worldwide network includes a fleet of more than 7,200 trucks and properties both leased and owned as described below:

In addition to the above we have one landfill, located in Argentina and we retained an inactive landfill in Mexico.  We are currently headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois, having occupied our new corporate headquarters during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Our Key Business Priorities 

Following its founding in 1989, Stericycle grew rapidly as the medical waste industry developed and largely through inorganic acquisitions. Growth from medical waste acquisitions helped us achieve scale of infrastructure, route density, and a leadership position in the U.S. We also leveraged acquisitions to enter new geographies or add additional services to our portfolio. As we grew and evolved, we operated without centralization and the efficiencies that come from an integrated, modern corporate structure and associated information systems. 

At the end of 2017, we began advancement of a business transformation, including the development and implementation of an ERP system, focused on driving long-term growth, improving profitability, and enhancing shareholder value. During 2019, we refocused our transformation efforts and aligned around five key business priorities. 

1.  

Portfolio rationalization – As we look to the future, we continue to pursue the divestiture of service lines or geographies that are not profitable, have limited growth potential, are not vertically integrated, are not essential to our regulated waste and compliance services and secure information destruction service categories, and/or present the opportunity to reduce debt. 

2.  

Quality of revenue – The services we offer help our customers meet complex regulations. Our expertise, infrastructure and service levels provide a differentiated and premium brand value to the customers we serve. As such, we are focused on improving the quality of revenue we deliver. During 2019, we added a Chief Commercial Officer and began implementing changes in our commercial operations. We realigned our sales organization around customer channels; implemented best practices for sales management and training; reorganized our marketing teams to focus functional area of expertise across services; and improved our contracting processes with customers. 

3.  

Operational cost efficiencies – Our day-to-day operations are shifting toward a standardized operating model to optimize processes, drive efficiencies and improve both safety and service. During 2019, we added a Chief Engineer and have begun centralizing operational decision making under a corporate engineering group. Additionally, we are focused on driving cost efficiencies through work measurement, asset optimization, use of technology, and expanded strategic sourcing. 

4.  

Debt reduction and leverage improvement – As a result of the debt accumulated from our historic acquisition strategy, debt structure and debt leverage improvement were a key focus in 2019. In June 2019, we raised $600 million from the issuance of our Senior Notes and $365 million from an incremental Term Loan. Combined with an additional draw from our Senior Credit Facility, Stericycle paid off its more restrictive $1.075 billion private placement notes. Additionally, in 2019, we applied cash flow from operations and proceeds from the divestitures discussed above, to enable a net debt reduction of approximately $100.0 million.

PART II 

5.  

ERP implementation – Over our 30-year history, Stericycle had acquired more than 500 companies without fully integrating certain acquisitions onto centralized information technology platforms.  The disparate operating and information systems have resulted in significant operational inefficiencies.  With the implementation of an ERP, we expect to improve daily decision making via real-time information insights, simplify and enhance forecast accuracy, provide transparency for greater accountability, aid in the development of strategic planning, and make it easier for our customers to do business with us. The “go-live” of the ERP system began in January 2020 with the global roll-out of the human-resources performance management solution. During 2020, the additional ERP capabilities, including commercial, operational and financial, will be implemented in a staged approach across our North America RWCS reportable segment, excluding the ESOL Disposal Group. 

Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data; Note 4 – Restructuring and Divestitures and Note 9 - Debt. 

Regulated Waste and Compliance Services 

Collection and Transportation  

The collection process for regulated waste streams or secure information destruction begins at the customer location with segregation. To assure regulatory compliance, we will not accept material from customers unless it complies with our waste acceptance protocols and is properly stored or packaged in containers that we have either supplied or approved. 

Our fleet of vehicles then collects containers at the customer location. The majority of collected waste or information for destruction is then transported directly to one of our processing facilities or to one of our transfer stations until it’s transported to a processing facility. Our use of transfer stations in a "hub and spoke" configuration improves the efficiency of our collection and transportation operations by expanding the geographic area that a particular processing facility can serve, thereby increasing the utilization of the facility and the volume of waste that it processes. 

Processing and Disposal of Regulated Medical Waste 

Upon arrival at a processing facility, containers or boxes of regulated waste undergo a quality control process to verify that they do not contain any unacceptable substances. Any container or box that is discovered to contain unacceptable waste goes through a corrective action process which could include  

2019 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 10   

PART II 

redirecting the waste, returning the waste to the customer, and/or notifying the appropriate regulatory authorities.  From there, regulated medical waste is processed using one of several treatments or processing technologies, predominantly at one of our wholly owned facilities: 

•  

Autoclaving: Autoclaving is the primary method of medical waste treatment. This process relies on steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens and render materials non-infectious. 

•  

Alternative Technologies: We use several different non-incineration alternatives to autoclaves, predominantly outside of the U.S. The processes used by these technologies are similar, as the regulated waste is heated to a specified temperature for a required time to kill the pathogens. This is not always under pressure. Depending on local requirements, the waste may be shredded before or after treatment to render it unrecognizable. 

•  

Incineration: Incineration burns regulated waste at elevated temperatures and reduces it to ash. Incineration reduces the volume of waste, and it is the recommended treatment and disposal option for some types of regulated waste such as anatomical waste, residues from chemotherapy procedures, and non-hazardous pharmaceutical waste. Air emissions from incinerators can contain certain byproducts that are subject to federal, state, and in some cases, local regulation. In some circumstances, the ash byproduct of incineration may be regulated. 

Upon completion of the particular treatment process, the resulting waste or incinerator ash is transported to for disposal in a landfill owned by unaffiliated third parties. In some countries, where permitted by regulation, the treated waste is recovered, including recovery as fuel in waste-to-energy processes. 

Processing and Disposal of Hazardous Wastes 

Our technicians receive hazardous wastes either as expired goods requiring deconstruction or as defined hazardous wastes that were generated by healthcare, retail or manufacturing and industrial organizations. Expired goods are deconstructed to recover metals and plastics for recycling, thereby minimizing the total volume of waste disposed of as hazardous waste. Materials that are predefined as hazardous upon collection are bulked together or consolidated at treatment storage and disposal facilities for more efficient transport to the final disposal or processing destination. Whenever possible, we seek sustainable solutions for managing materials including alternative uses, recovery processes, recycling options, fuel blending, or energy recovery. When sustainable options do not exist, these wastes are sent to third parties for incineration, landfill, or water treatment. 

Destruction and Recycling of Secure Information 

We leverage a combination of off-site and on-site shredding methods. Approximately 63% of collected documents for secure destruction in 2019 were sent off-site to a regional shredding facility for secure destruction. The remainder of collected documents are shredded on-site in a Shred-it® truck with proprietary information destruction technology. For both methods, documents are cross-cut shredded to enhance the security level of destruction. 

Shredded paper is then baled to be sold as SOP for recycling. SOP consists of paper typically generated by offices that contains primarily white paper. It’s a higher value recyclable than mixed paper, old newspapers or magazines. Stericycle collected and delivered approximately 750,000 tons of SOP for recycling into paper products to be used in the hospitality industry including napkins, paper towels, and bathroom tissue. During 2019, prices for SOP declined consecutively each month of the year resulting in an average annual SOP price of $132 per ton in 2019 as reported by Fastmarkets RISI, a decline of 30.5% over 2018.

PART II 

Communication and Related Services  

During the year ended December 31, 2019 we divested of our North American telephone answering services business, which provided live voice and automated communication services for small healthcare providers and other small businesses. 

Our remaining Communication Solutions provides live voice and automated services to assist hospitals and IDNs in communications with their patients. Our team serves as a client representative providing appointment scheduling, appointment reminders, event registration, and other communications. Providing this service requires information management systems to redirect calls, store and quickly retrieve live voice protocols or client data, send automated communications, or provide easily accessible reporting and activity details to our customers. Beyond the information management system infrastructure, call center staffing and proper education levels are critical to our success. 

Our Expert Solutions specializes in partnering with automotive, food/beverage, medical device, pharmaceutical, consumer goods manufacturers, and others to support them through critical recalls, retrievals, or audit processes to ensure brand protection. Services could include notification services to impacted customers, call center services to support a recall or retrieval, removing impacted product from distribution, processing recalled product and supporting remedy requirements, and compliance reporting. These solutions are highly customized based on the product being recalled or retrieved and the specific needs of the client. 

Our Business Model and Key Business Attributes 

Regulated Business-to-Business Operations 

We focus on providing business-to-business services in areas of operations that are highly regulated. By helping our customers maintain compliance with complex regulations, we protect people and brands, promote health, and safeguard the environment. Governmental legislation and regulation increasingly require the proper handling and disposal of items such as medical waste, hazardous waste, pharmaceutical waste, and personal confidential information. Regulated waste can be defined as any material with government-imposed guidelines for handling the material for transportation or disposal. 

•  

Medical waste, such as needles, syringes, gloves, cultures, blood and blood products, and material potentially contaminated by infectious agents, can potentially cause an infectious disease. 

•  

Hazardous waste is designated and governed by federal and local environmental protection agencies. It generally includes waste that is considered dangerous or potentially harmful to our health or the environment during transportation and disposal. 

•  

Pharmaceutical waste may be hazardous or nonhazardous and consists of expired, recalled, or otherwise unused pharmaceuticals. 

•  

Personal confidential information includes documents and e-media containing protected healthcare information, financial information, or other confidential information. 

Growing Markets 

The services we offer, especially core services of regulated medical waste and secure information destruction, are growing. This growth is driven by multiple factors:  

•  

Aging Population: The average age of the population in the countries where we operate is rising, driving increases in healthcare and the quantity of regulated medical wastes generated. 

•  

Enforcement of Waste Regulations: Enforcement of regulations relating to the management of regulated waste is increasing. Penalties for violations can be costly and high profile, thereby  

2019 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 12   

PART II 

impacting a business’ overall reputation. We believe that many businesses are unaware either of the need for proper training of employees or of applicable regulatory requirements and we seek to help businesses fill this gap. 

•  

Regulation of Privacy and Information Security and Concerns over Data Breaches: The continued development and growth of the secure information destruction industry has been driven, in part, by the need for compliance with increasing government regulation with respect to privacy and information security, including the European Global Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. 

•  

Market Expansion Due to Increased Outsourcing: With regard to secure information destruction services and communication services, we believe significant market growth will come from increased reliance on outsourcing services by those businesses within the marketplace that currently do not use an outside vendor. 

•  

Increased Business Focus on Sustainability: Businesses large and small are continuing to realize that a focus on sustainability is now essential to operating efficiently and meeting the increasing demands of customers for environmental responsibility. Such pressures are driving proper disposal of pharmaceuticals, recycling efforts, creative disposal efforts for unused inventory, shred-all policies for paper, and other initiatives supported by our services. 

Stable and Recurring Customer Needs Supported by Long-term Contracts  

The services we provide most often require service on a routine and scheduled basis. Historically, our revenues have not been significantly affected by economic downturns. The majority of our customer relationships include long-term contracts ranging from two to five years in length. We have developed a strong and loyal customer base, with, we believe, a revenue retention rate of approximately 90% (based on our internal customer attrition analysis). 

Strong Service Relationships with Customers 

We are a trusted provider of outsourced services that address complex, regulated, or compliance-based business needs and do so with high customer service levels. Our U.S. net promoter scores, an index ranging from -100 to 100 that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company's products or services, were over 69% for regulated medical waste and over 75% for secure information destruction. Based on the global Net Promoter Score standards, any score above 0 would be considered “good”, 50 and above being “excellent” while 70 and above is considered "world class". 

Established Network of Processing and Transportation Locations 

We believe that our infrastructure network results in an expansive operational network with alternate treatment or destruction options for our customers. The scale of our network also provides us the ability to be the single-source provider for customers with multiple locations across the country and gives us the flexibility to quickly redirect services or operations to another location if the need arises due to severe weather, power outages, or other disruptions. 

Routing Logistics 

While we manage large volumes of waste or secure information for destruction, the average volume per customer site is small and the resulting revenue per stop is low. As such, route logistics and route efficiency are a core focus. This vast transportation network provides us with an advantage compared to our competition. Additionally, we have continued to make route density and technological investments to optimize routing at both the individual truck and geographic market level. We believe that our ERP  

2019 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 13   

PART II 

implementation will further improve our routing efficiencies by providing the opportunity to leverage our infrastructure across services lines and driving standard work across the network. 

Industry Leadership and Expertise 

Based on our infrastructure and revenues, we maintain a global leadership position across our various services lines, including regulated medical waste, retail and healthcare hazardous waste, secure information destruction, and product recalls and returns. We attract and retain highly experienced team members who have a deep understanding of the industries they serve, the regulatory climate, and the evolving needs of the customers we serve. We collaborate regularly with a wide range of stakeholders and interest groups. We proactively work with organizations like the CDC, DEA, OSHA, EPA, and many other government and regulatory bodies, including law enforcement. Our experts are frequent speakers at hospital networks, industry trade associations, and actively engage in numerous community meetings each year.  

Over the course of 2019, we significantly elevated the importance of safety across the organization and executed against multiple initiatives to improve our safety performance. We established safety metrics and tracking that are shared across the organization and kicked off a behavior-based safety program designed to influence our team members’ actions toward safer outcomes. To reduce vehicle accidents, we began the roll-out of a new driver camera safety program, installing cameras in our North American RWCS trucks. We also initiated a Toolbox Talk program for transportation teams in North America to promote routine conversations targeting driver safety. These efforts and others resulted in a 22% reduction in lost time days and a 13% reduction in vehicle related accident claims in 2019. 

Competition 

The industries and markets in which we operate are highly competitive on pricing, and barriers to entry are low. Our competitors consist of many different types of service providers, including national, regional, and local companies. Some of these companies provide only a portion of the services of Stericycle, for example just collection and transportation but not treatment of medical waste or medical waste service but not a sharps management program. In the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, another source of competition is on-site management. 

For regulated medical waste, some large-quantity waste generators, particularly hospitals, may choose an onsite autoclave or other treatment process. For secure information destruction, many businesses may choose to use small, on-site shredders for their documents. In both medical waste and secure information destruction, there is no other competitor in North America with Stericycle’s overall scale, breadth of services, national transportation network, and comprehensive treatment network. 

Governmental Regulation 

The regulated medical waste, hazardous waste, secure information destruction, and recall industries are subject to numerous regulations. In many countries there are multiple regulatory agencies at the local and national level that oversee our customers or our services. This regulatory framework imposes a variety of compliance requirements, including requirements to obtain and maintain government permits. We maintain numerous governmental permits, registrations, and licenses to conduct our business in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our permits vary by jurisdiction based upon our activities within that jurisdiction and on the applicable laws and regulations of that jurisdiction. These permits grant us the authority, among other things: 

•  

to construct and operate collection, transfer, and processing facilities; 

2019 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 14   

PART II 

•  

to transport regulated waste within and between relevant jurisdictions; and 

•  

to handle particular regulated substances. 

Our permits, registrations, and licenses may be subject to modification or revocation by the issuing authority and, in some jurisdictions, are subject to periodic renewal. Periodic renewals may be subject to public participation and can lead to additional regulatory oversight. We are also subject to regulations that govern the definition, generation, segregation, handling, packaging, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of regulated waste. In addition, we are subject to extensive regulations to ensure public and employee health and safety at the federal, state and local levels. 

We are subject to substantial regulations enacted and enforced by the U.S. government and by the governments of the foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct regulated waste and secure information destruction operations. The regulatory requirements with which we must comply vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The laws governing our domestic and international operations generally consist of statutes, legislation, and regulations concerning environmental protection, employee health and welfare, transportation, document management, ethical business conduct, and proper handling and management of regulated waste streams, and controlled substances. 

Environmental Protection 

Certain services within our business are subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations in all of the geographies in which we operate. Generally, the environmental laws we are subject to regulate the handling, transporting, and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, the release or potential release of hazardous substances into the environment, the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, and other surface waters, and the emission of pollutants into the air. The principal environmental laws that govern our operations in the U.S. are state environmental regulatory agencies as they provide the specific legislative and/or regulatory frameworks which require the management and treatment of regulated medical waste. Additionally, the RCRA, the CERCLA, and the Clean Air Act of 1970 are the federal regulations that affect management of certain aspects of regulated medical waste and all RCRA hazardous wastes. CERCLA and state laws similar to it may impose strict, joint and several liabilities on the current and former owners and operators of facilities from which release of hazardous substances has occurred and on the generators and transporters of the hazardous substances that come to be located at these facilities. The 10 HMIW incinerators, located at 7 sites, we currently operate in the U.S. must comply with the emissions standards imposed by the applicable states permitting authorities pursuant to regulations promulgated under the Clean Air Act as well as state and/or municipal waste permit requirements. 

Examples of environmental laws applicable to our international operations include the Waste Framework Directive, Environmental Liabilities Directive, Industrial Emissions Directive and the Shipments of Waste Regulations in the EU, Ley 154 (Residuos Patogenicos) in Argentina, Lei 12.305/2010 (Lei Ordinária) Institui A Política Nacional De Resíduos Sólidos in Brazil, and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and related regulations in Canada. Additional environmental laws at the federal and/or local levels apply to regulated waste management in other markets in which we conduct business. 

Employee Health and Welfare 

We are subject to numerous regulations promulgated to protect and promote worker health and welfare through the implementation and enforcement of standards designed to prevent illness, injury and death in the workplace. The primary U.S. federal laws relating to employee health and welfare applicable to our business are in OSHA, which establishes specific employer responsibilities including engineering controls,  

2019 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 15   

PART II 

administrative controls, training, policies and programs complying with the regulations, and recordkeeping and reporting, all in an effort to ensure a safe workplace. Various OSHA standards apply to almost all aspects of our operations and govern such matters as exposure to blood-borne pathogens, hazard communication, personal and protective equipment. 

Examples of employee health and welfare laws applicable to our international operations include the European Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work (Directive 89/391 EEC), and various provisions of the Canada Labour Code and related occupational safety and health regulations in the provinces and territories of Canada. 

Transportation 

Various laws regulating the transportation of waste and other potentially hazardous materials also apply to the services we provide. In the U.S., the DOT has established regulations which deal with two different aspects of transportation: hazardous materials transport and safety in transportation. These regulations are defined within the PHMSA and the FMCSA. Due to our fleet size we are regularly subject to roadside inspections. These inspections have a cumulative effect on our compliance history and require us to remain in good standing so as not to jeopardize our permits. 

Examples of transportation laws applicable to our international operations include the Directive on the Inland Transportation of Dangerous Goods in the EU and the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act and related regulations in Canada, and globally the International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code and the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. 

Document Management 

Numerous laws and regulations require proper protection of confidential customer information by business parties that have access to such information. In the U.S., the most cited regulations include the FACTA Final Disposal Rule, the FACTA Red Flag Rule, HIPAA, and the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act. Furthermore, the GDPR provides the framework for data privacy and data protection for companies that conduct business in Europe. 

For the transportation of secure information for destruction, we are regulated by the DOT as a commercial motor carrier. The processes for the destruction of secure information destruction processes are not regulated by any government agency. However, the NAID maintains a certification to ensure that destruction processes support the needs of organizations to meet laws and regulations relating to the protection of confidential information. We currently hold the NAID AAA Certification for our operations in North America. Further, the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council has developed Data Security Standards which are imposed upon merchants utilizing credit cards and require destruction of documents and media in accordance with their standards. 

Ethical Business Conduct 

Various international regulations governing ethical business practices apply to our business, including but not limited to, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act, and the Brazilian Clean Companies Act. These laws may apply to our business on both a global and local basis, and ban unethical behavior such as the payment of bribes to government officials for the purpose of gaining an improper business advantage, improper maintenance of our books and records, as well as other financial transparency requirements. 

Controlled Substances 

Our service offerings for the recall, return and/or destruction of controlled substance pharmaceuticals are subject to numerous laws and regulations under various international federal agencies, such as the DEA in  

2019 10-K Annual Report   

Stericycle, Inc. • 16   

PART II 

the U.S. and the Home Office Drugs and Firearm Licensing Unit in the U.K. These regulations apply to both the closed loop management of controlled substances as well as the return of unused controlled substances from consumers. These regulations typically require facilities to obtain a controlled substance registration in addition to other pharmaceutical licenses and meet certain criteria in order to collect, process, and dispose of controlled substances. These regulations have very strict requirements for the management of employees, the type of security within facilities, recordkeeping, and the reporting of all controlled substances managed at the facility. Much like our other permitting, the registration must be updated regularly and subjects us to inspection and enforcement. 

U.S. and Foreign Local Regulation for Waste Management 

We conduct business in all 50 U.S. States and Puerto Rico. Because the EPA does not promulgate regulations for regulated medical waste at a national level, each state has its own regulations related to the handling, treatment, and storage of regulated medical waste. Many states have followed requirements similar to the Medical Waste Tracking Act of 1988 or have placed medical waste regulations under solid waste regulations. Hazardous waste in the U.S. is regulated under the RCRA. In addition, certain states may have their own regulations for handling, treatment and storage of hazardous wastes. Regulated garbage (sometimes referred to as “APHIS waste” taken from the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service) is another area of regulatory requirements we are subject to pursuant to regulations promulgated by the USDA and Customers and Border Patrol. The USDA typically inspects our facilities receiving such APHIS waste on a quarterly basis. 

In each state where we operate a processing facility or a transfer station, we are required to comply with varying state and local laws and regulations which may also require a specific operating plan. In addition, many local governments have ordinances and regulations, such as zoning or wastewater regulations that affect our operations. Similarly, our international operations are subject to regulations enacted and enforced at the provincial, municipal, and local levels of government in addition to the national regulations with which we must comply. 

Potential Liability and Insurance 

The regulated waste industry involves potentially significant risks of statutory, contractual, tort, and common law liability claims. Potential liability claims could involve, for example: 

•  

cleanup costs; 

•  

personal injury; 

•  

damage to the environment; 

•  

employee matters; 

•  

property damage; or 

•  

alleged negligence or professional errors or omissions in the planning or performance of work. 

We could also be subject to fines or penalties in connection with violations of regulatory requirements. 

We carry several insurance coverages including property, workers compensation, general liability, employer’s liability, pollution liability, privacy and security liability, event management, cyber-liability, directors and officers, and miscellaneous professional services errors and omissions coverages. We also carry umbrella policies that cover general liability, auto and employers liability. We regularly evaluate other lines of coverage to respond to specific business needs but consider our current insurance coverage
