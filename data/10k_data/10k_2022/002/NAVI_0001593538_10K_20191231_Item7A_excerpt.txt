Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis  

Our interest rate risk management seeks to limit the impact of short-term movements in interest rates on our results of operations and financial position. The following tables summarize the potential effect on earnings over the next 12 months and the potential effect on fair values of balance sheet assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, based upon a sensitivity analysis performed by management assuming a hypothetical increase and decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points. The earnings sensitivities assume an immediate increase and decrease in market interest rates of 100 basis points and are applied only to financial assets and liabilities, including hedging instruments, that existed at the balance sheet date and do not take into account any new assets, liabilities or hedging instruments that may arise over the next 12 months. In prior years our interest rate sensitivity analysis assumed a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of 100 basis points and 300 basis points. We changed to a hypothetical increase and decrease of 100 basis points primarily due to (1) interest rates increasing from historical low levels in the previous years which results in the revised presentation aligning with what we think reasonably possible changes in interest rates over the next year could be and (2) the scenario better aligns and makes us more comparable with how other financial institutions prepare their disclosures.

A primary objective in our funding is to minimize our sensitivity to changing interest rates by generally funding our floating rate education loan portfolio with floating rate debt and our fixed rate education loan portfolio with fixed rate debt. However, we can have a mismatch in the index (including the frequency of reset) of floating rate debt versus floating rate assets. In addition, due to the ability of some FFELP Loans to earn Floor Income, we can have a fixed versus floating mismatch in funding if the education loan earns at the fixed borrower rate and the funding remains floating. During 2019 and 2018, certain FFELP Loans were earning Floor Income and we locked in a portion of that Floor Income through the use of derivative contracts. The result of these hedging transactions was to fix the relative spread between the education loan asset rate and the variable rate liability.  

In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in pre-tax net income before the mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities is primarily due to the impact of (i) our unhedged loans being in a fixed-rate mode due to Floor Income, while being funded with variable rate debt in low interest rate environments; and (ii) a portion of our fixed rate assets being funded with variable rate liabilities. Both items will generally cause income to decrease when interest rates increase and income to increase when interest rates decrease. The decrease in income in 2019 when interest rates increase 100 basis points is due primarily to item (i) above. In particular, the primary factor relates to FFELP Stafford loans containing an annual reset floor feature that began earning floor income in the third quarter of 2019 but were not earning floor income in 2018 because of the higher rate environment at that time. If interest rates increase 100 basis point these loans will no longer earn floor income. The increase in income in 2019 when interest rates decrease 100 basis points relates in part to these same FFELP Stafford loans with the annual reset floor feature that will earn more floor income as interest rates fall further in a lower rate environment in 2019 as compared to 2018.  

In the preceding tables, under the scenario where interest rates increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the change in mark-to-market gains (losses) on derivative and hedging activities in 2019 and 2018 is primarily due to (i) the notional amount and remaining term of our derivative portfolio and related hedged debt and (ii) the interest rate environment. The increase in the mark-to-market income in 2019 as compared to 2018 when interest rates increase 100 basis points is due to additional pay fix/receive variable trading swaps that are used to economically hedge originations of fixed rate refinance loans, a smaller notional amount of receive fix/pay variable trading swaps, and the

impact of a lower interest rate environment in 2019 on derivative contracts that hedge floor income. The decrease in the mark-to-market income in 2019 as compared to 2018 when interest rates decrease 100 basis points is due to these same subsets of our derivative portfolio that will lose value in a falling rate environment.   

In addition to interest rate risk addressed in the preceding tables, we are also exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates. Foreign currency exchange risk is primarily the result of foreign currency denominated debt issued by us. When we issue foreign denominated corporate unsecured and securitization debt, our policy is to use cross currency interest rate swaps to swap all foreign currency denominated debt payments (fixed and floating) to U.S. dollar LIBOR using a fixed exchange rate. In the tables above, there would be an immaterial impact on earnings if exchange rates were to decrease or increase, due to the terms of the hedging instrument and hedged items matching. The balance sheet interest bearing liabilities would be affected by a change in exchange rates; however, the change would be materially offset by the cross-currency interest rate swaps in other assets or other liabilities. In the current economic environment, volatility in the spread between spot and forward foreign exchange rates has resulted in mark-to-market impacts to current-period earnings which have not been factored into the above analysis. The earnings impact is noncash, and at maturity of the instruments the cumulative mark-to-market impact will be zero. Navient has not issued foreign currency denominated debt since 2008.  

Asset and Liability Funding Gap  

The tables below present our assets and liabilities (funding) arranged by underlying indices as of December 31,2019. In the following GAAP presentation, the funding gap only includes derivatives that qualify as effective hedges (those derivatives which are reflected in net interest margin, as opposed to those reflected in the “gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities, net” line on the consolidated statements of income). The difference between the asset and the funding is the funding gap for the specified index. This represents our exposure to interest rate risk in the form of basis risk and repricing risk, which is the risk that the different indices may reset at different frequencies or may not move in the same direction or at the same magnitude.  

Management analyzes interest rate risk and in doing so includes all derivatives that are economically hedging our debt whether they qualify as effective hedges or not (Core Earnings basis). Accordingly, we are also presenting the asset and liability funding gap on a Core Earnings basis in the table that follows the GAAP presentation.  

GAAP Basis  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Funding (by index) includes all derivatives that qualify as hedges.  

(2)  

Funding consists of auction rate ABS and ABCP facilities.  

(3)  

Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes the obligation to return cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures.  

(4)  

Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders’ equity.  

The “Funding Gaps” in the above table are primarily interest rate mismatches in short-term indices between our assets and liabilities. We address this issue typically through the use of basis swaps that typically convert quarterly reset three-month LIBOR to other indices that are more correlated to our asset indices. These basis swaps do not qualify as effective hedges and, as a result, the effect on the funding index is not included in our interest margin and is therefore excluded from the GAAP presentation.

Core Earnings Basis  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Funding (by index) includes all derivatives that management considers economic hedges of interest rate risk and reflects how we internally manage our interest rate exposure.  

(2)  

Funding consists of auction rate ABS and ABCP facilities.  

(3)  

Assets include restricted and unrestricted cash equivalents and other overnight type instruments. Funding includes the obligation to return cash collateral held related to derivatives exposures.  

(4)  

Assets include receivables and other assets (including goodwill and acquired intangibles). Funding includes other liabilities and stockholders’ equity.  

We use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to achieve our risk management objectives. Our asset liability management strategy is to match assets with debt (in combination with derivatives) that have the same underlying index and reset frequency or, when economical, have interest rate characteristics that we believe are highly correlated. The use of funding with index types and reset frequencies that are different from our assets exposes us to interest rate risk in the form of basis and repricing risk. This could result in our cost of funds not moving in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the yield on our assets. While we believe this risk is low, as all of these indices are short-term with rate movements that are highly correlated over a long period of time, market disruptions (which have occurred in prior years) can lead to a temporary divergence between indices resulting in a negative impact to our earnings.
