History

AT&T, formerly known as SBC Communications Inc. (SBC), was formed as one of several regional holding companies created to hold AT&T Corp.’s (ATTC) local telephone companies. On January 1, 1984, we were spun-off from ATTC pursuant to an anti-trust consent decree, becoming an independent publicly-traded telecommunications services provider. At formation, we primarily operated in five southwestern states. 

Following our formation, we have expanded our footprint and operations by acquiring various businesses, most significantly: 

Our subsidiaries merged with Pacific Telesis Group in 1997, Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation in 1998 and Ameritech Corporation in 1999, thereby expanding our wireline operations as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) into a total of 13 states.

In 2005, we merged one of our subsidiaries with ATTC, creating one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers. In connection with the merger, we changed the name of our company from “SBC Communications Inc.” to “AT&T Inc.”

In 2006, we merged one of our subsidiaries with BellSouth Corporation (BellSouth) making us the ILEC in an additional nine states. With the BellSouth acquisition, we also acquired BellSouth’s 40 percent economic interest in AT&T Mobility LLC (AT&T Mobility), formerly Cingular Wireless LLC, resulting in 100 percent ownership of AT&T Mobility.

In 2014, we completed the acquisition of wireless provider Leap Wireless International, Inc. and sold our ILEC operations in Connecticut, which we had previously acquired in 1998.

In January and April 2015, we acquired wireless properties in Mexico, and acquired DIRECTV, a leading provider of digital television entertainment services in both the United States and Latin America.

In June 2018, we acquired Time Warner Inc. (Time Warner), a leader in media and entertainment that operates the Turner, Home Box Office (HBO) and Warner Bros. business units. We also acquired Otter Media Holdings August 2018 and advertising platform AppNexus in August 2018.

In late 2019, we announced the sale of wireless and wireline operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands; the sale is expected to close in mid-2020.

Areas of Focus

We are in a period of rapid growth in wireless video usage and believe that there are substantial opportunities available for next-generation converged services that combine technologies and services. Our First Responder Network Authority (FirstNet) contract and our strong spectrum position allows us to execute a different 5G deployment strategy. With our upcoming launch of HBO Max, we will capitalize on our premier network, technology and distribution capabilities to provide our premier content in this unique offering. Our recent fiber expansion allows us to respond to continuing advances in technology and changing demands from our customers. We expect our transition to software-based products with low acquisition costs will provide better economics and improve our product portfolio, including expansion into streaming TV. Our acquisitions over the past few years and our continued investment in a premier network experience make our customers’

2

AT&T Inc.

Dollars in millions except per share amounts

lives more convenient and productive and foster competition and further innovation in the communications and entertainment industry. In 2020, we plan to focus on the areas discussed below.

Communications

Our integrated telecommunications network utilizes different technological platforms, including wireless, satellite and wireline, to provide instant connectivity and at the higher speeds made possible by our fiber network expansion and wireless network enhancements. Video streaming will also drive greater demand for broadband and capitalize on our fiber deployment. These investments prepare us to meet increased customer demand for enhanced wireless and broadband services, including video streaming, augmented reality and “smart” technologies. During 2020, we will continue to develop and provide high-value integrated video, mobile and broadband solutions. We believe offering integrated services facilitates our customers’ desire to view video anywhere on demand and encourages customer retention.

Wireless Service We are experiencing rapid growth in data usage as consumers are demanding seamless access across their wireless and wired devices, and businesses and municipalities are connecting more and more equipment and facilities to the internet. We were awarded the FirstNet contract, which provides us with access to 20 MHz of nationwide low band spectrum and invested in 5G and millimeter-wave technologies with our acquisition of FiberTower Corporation, which currently holds significant amounts of spectrum in the millimeter wave bands (39 GHz) that the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reallocated for mobile broadband services. These bands will help to accelerate our entry into 5G services. At December 31, 2019, our FirstNet coverage is approximately 75 percent complete with more than 1.0 million FirstNet connections. We expect to have mobile 5G service nationwide to more than 200 million people by the second quarter 2020, and with that availability, we anticipate the introduction of 5G handsets and devices will contribute to a renewed interest in equipment upgrades. We will continue to invest in our wireless network as we look to provide future service offerings and participate in technologies, such as 5G and millimeter-wave bands. The increased speeds and network operating efficiency expected with this technology should enable massive deployment of devices connected to the internet as well as faster delivery of data services. We expect that 5G will enhance our customers’ entire connected experience and not just provide faster speeds.

Our network covers over 430 million people in North America with 4G LTE technology, and, in the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 330 million people with our LTE technology. Our 3G network provides services to customers using older handsets and connected devices. We expect to redeploy spectrum currently used for our 3G services as we transition to 5G service and project that we will discontinue service on our 3G network in early 2022; we will manage this process consistent with previous network upgrades. As of December 31, 2019, about 7 percent of our postpaid subscribers were using 3G handsets, and we expect them to transition to newer technologies. We do not expect this transition to have a material impact on our consolidated operating results.

As the wireless industry has matured, future wireless growth will increasingly depend on our ability to offer innovative data services on a wireless network that has sufficient spectrum and capacity to support these innovations. We continue to invest significant capital in expanding our network capacity, as well as obtaining additional spectrum that meets our long-term needs. We have participated in recent FCC spectrum auctions, including the 24 GHz auction in 2019, and have been redeploying spectrum previously used for more basic services to support more advanced mobile internet services.

Broadband Technology We are rapidly converting to a software-based network and managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach, of which we are a global leader in our commitment to virtualize 75 percent of our network by the end of 2020, delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network will be able to support next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently.

Media

We produce and distribute high-quality video content to take advantage of growing global demand. Our media businesses use their strong brands, distinctive intellectual property and global scale to produce and distribute quality content. As the television industry continues to evolve from a distribution system using satellite and cable offerings to internet streaming video services, we are well-positioned to address and capitalize on these changes, but we face financial risks and new sources of competition associated with these developments. We plan in 2020 to continue launching more personalized services offered directly to consumers through our own distribution and distribution partner channels, including our streaming platform HBO Max, scheduled for launch in May 2020. AT&T customers on premium video, mobile and broadband services will be offered bundles with HBO Max included at no additional charge. We also plan to add an advertising-supported HBO Max offering to take advantage of our advertising capabilities. In the future, we also plan to provide HBO Max subscribers with unique live, interactive and special event programming.

Advertising

Our Xandr segment relies on using data from our 170 million customer relationships, to deliver digital and video advertising that is more relevant to consumers. Advertisers are interested in capitalizing on our broad video distribution and ability to offer more precise marketing to customers through a digital platform. We also are expanding relationships with other video providers and digital publishers to use our platforms to reach their audiences. We believe this segment will benefit from the nationwide election cycle in 2020.

Latin America

We believe that the wireless model in the U.S., with accelerating demand for mobile internet service and the associated economic benefits, will be repeated around the world as companies invest in high-speed mobile networks. Due in part to changes in the legal and regulatory framework in Mexico in 2015, we acquired Mexican wireless operations to establish a seamless, cross-border North American wireless network covering an area with over 430 million people and businesses in the United States and Mexico. Our 4G LTE network in Mexico now covers approximately 100 million people and businesses. Our Vrio business unit provides video services to primarily residential customers using satellite technology in Latin America and the Caribbean. We have approximately 13 million video subscribers in Latin America.

BUSINESS OPERATIONS

OPERATING SEGMENTS

Our segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We analyze our operating segments based on segment contribution, which consists of operating income, excluding acquisition-related costs and other significant items, and equity in net income (loss) of affiliates for investments managed within each operating segment. We have four reportable segments: (1) Communications, (2) WarnerMedia, (3) Latin America and (4) Xandr.

Additional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading “Segment Results” in Item 7. and in Note 4 of Item 8.

COMMUNICATIONS

Our Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom, video and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&T, Cricket, AT&T PREPAID and DIRECTV brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 77% of 2019 segment operating revenues and 76% of our 2019 total segment contribution. This segment contains the Mobility, Entertainment Group and Business Wireline business units.

Mobility – Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless services to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid, connected device or reseller. At December 31,

4

AT&T Inc.

Dollars in millions except per share amounts

2019, we served 166 million Mobility subscribers, including 75 million postpaid, 18 million prepaid, 7 million reseller and 66 million connected devices. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.

Wireless Services

We offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through our FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety.

Consumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced integrated and data-centric devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer plans that include unlimited features allowing for the sharing of voice, text and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. Customers in our “connected device” category (e.g., users of monitoring devices and automobile systems) generally purchase those devices from third-party suppliers that buy data access supported by our network. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.

We also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&T PREPAIDSM brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.

Equipment 

We sell a wide variety of handsets, wirelessly enabled computers and wireless data cards manufactured by various suppliers for use with our voice and data services. We also sell accessories, such as carrying cases and hands-free devices. We sell through our own company-owned stores, agents and third-party retail stores. We provide our customers the ability to purchase handsets on an installment basis and the opportunity to bring their own device. In recent years, subscribers have been bringing their own devices or retaining their handsets for longer periods, which could continue to impact upgrade activity. Like other wireless service providers, we also provide a limited number of postpaid contract subscribers substantial equipment subsidies to initiate, renew or upgrade service.

Entertainment Group – Our Entertainment Group business unit provides video, internet/broadband, voice communication and interactive and targeted advertising services to customers in the United States by utilizing our IP-based and copper wired network and/or our satellite technology. Our Entertainment Group business unit revenue includes the following categories: video entertainment, high-speed internet, legacy voice and data services and other service and equipment.

Video Entertainment 

Video entertainment revenues are comprised of subscription and advertising revenues. We offer video entertainment services using satellite and IP-based technologies (referred to as “premium” or “linear”) as well as streaming options that do not require either satellite or wired IP services (referred to as “over-the-top” or “OTT”). Our offerings are structured to provide customers with the best video experience both inside and outside of the home by offering subscribers attractive programming and state-of-the-art technology. Due to the rising cost of programming as well as higher costs to acquire new subscribers in an increasingly competitive industry, we have discontinued long-term (e.g., two-year) price locks for subscribers, and have instead adopted a strategy of focusing on higher-value subscribers with offerings that distinguish and elevate our video entertainment experience for our new and existing customers. In trial markets, we have started bundling our fiber broadband offer with AT&T TV, which is delivered over our software-based video architecture and has a lower subscriber acquisition cost.

We provide approximately 20 million subscribers with access to hundreds of channels of digital-quality video entertainment and audio programming. In addition, our video entertainment subscribers have the ability to use the internet and/or our mobile applications from smartphones and tablets to view authorized content, search program listings and schedule DVR recordings. Our customers continue to shift, consistent with the rest of the industry, from a premium linear service to our more economically priced OTT video service, or to competitors, which has pressured our video revenues.

We believe it is critical that we extend our brand leadership as a premium pay-TV provider in the marketplace by providing a direct to consumer video experience both at home and on mobile devices. Our traditional linear business historically has generated at least $4,000, including synergies resulting from our DIRECTV acquisition. We believe that our flexible platform with a broadband and wireless connection is the most efficient way to transport that content. Through this integrated approach, we can optimize the use of storage in the home as well as in the cloud, while also providing a seamless service for

5

AT&T Inc.

Dollars in millions except per share amounts

consumers across screens and locations. We expect our upcoming streaming platform HBO Max to provide an attractive offering of video options as well as bundling opportunities for our wireless customers and will drive our direct to consumer strategy.

High-Speed Internet

We offer broadband and internet services to 13.6 million residential subscribers, with 3.9 million fiber broadband connections at December 31, 2019. Our IP-based technology provides high-speed internet services.

Legacy Voice and Data Services 

Revenues from our traditional voice services continue to decline as customers switch to wireless or VoIP services provided by us, cable companies or other internet-based providers. We have responded by offering packages of combined voice and data services, including broadband and video, and intend to continue this strategy during 2020.

Business Wireline – Our Business Wireline business unit provides services to business customers, including multinational corporations, small and mid-sized businesses, governmental and wholesale customers. Our Business Wireline business unit revenue includes the following categories: strategic and managed services, legacy voice and data services, and other services and equipment.

Strategic and Managed Services 

Strategic and managed services are our most advanced business solutions and allow our customers to create and manage their own internal networks and to access external data networks. Additionally, we provide collaboration services that utilize our IP infrastructure and allow our customers to utilize the most advanced technology to improve their productivity. Our strategic and managed services are made up of Strategic Data, Strategic Voice, Security, Cloud Solutions, Outsourcing, Managed Services and Professional Services. Strategic Data services include our Virtual Private Networks (VPN), AT&T Dedicated Internet (ADI), and Ethernet and Broadband Services. We continue to reconfigure our wireline network to take advantage of the latest technologies and services. We have developed services that rely on our SDN and NFV to enhance business customers’ digital agility in a rapidly evolving environment. We also provide state-of-the-art security solutions like Threat Management, Intrusion Detection and other business security applications. Due to developing technology, our most advanced business solutions are subject to change periodically. We review and evaluate our strategic and managed service offerings annually, which may result in an updated definition and the recast of our historical financial information to conform to the current period presentation. Any modifications will be reflected in the first quarter.

Legacy Voice and Data Services 

Voice services include services provided to business and governmental customers, either directly or through wholesale arrangements with other service providers. Our circuit-based, traditional data products include switched and dedicated transport services that allow customers to transmit data at high speeds, as well as access to the internet using a DSL connection.

Other Services and Equipment

Other service revenues include licensing of intellectual property and customer premises equipment.

Additional information on our Communications segment is the “Overview” section of Item 7.

WARNERMEDIA

Our WarnerMedia segment is comprised of leading media and entertainment businesses that principally develop, produce and distribute feature films, television content, and other content globally; operate cable networks, premium pay television and OTT services domestically and internationally; and operate digital media properties. The WarnerMedia segment provided approximately 18% of 2019 segment operating revenues and 22% of our 2019 total segment contribution. This segment consists primarily of the Turner, Home Box Office and Warner Bros. business units and will include our new HBO Max steaming platform.

Turner – The Turner business unit operates television networks and related properties that offer branded news, entertainment, sports and kids multi-platform content for consumers around the world.

Turner licenses programming to distributors that have contracted to receive and deliver the programming to subscribers, sells advertising on its networks and its digital properties owned or managed for other companies, and licenses its original

6

AT&T Inc.

Dollars in millions except per share amounts

programming and brands and characters for consumer products and other business ventures. Turner revenue includes the following categories: subscription, advertising and content and other.

Subscription

Turner’s programming is primarily delivered by distributors and is available to subscribers of the distributors for viewing live and on demand on television and on various internet-connected devices through the distributors’ services and Turner’s network apps. Turner’s license agreements with its distributors are typically multi-year arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and have fee arrangements that are generally related to the number of subscribers served by the distributor and the networks provided to the distributor.

Advertising

Advertising arrangements for its networks generally have terms of one year or less. In the U.S., the advertising revenues generally depend on the size and demographics of a network’s audience delivered to an advertiser, the number of units of time sold and the price per unit. The price per unit of advertising is determined considering factors such as the type of program or network and/or the time of day the advertising is to be run. Certain advertising inventory is sold in the “upfront” market in advance each year and other inventory in the “scatter” market closer to the time a program airs. Outside the U.S., advertising is generally sold at a fixed rate for the unit of time sold, determined by the time of day and network.

Turner’s digital properties consist of owned assets and those managed and/or operated for sports leagues where Turner holds the related programming rights. Digital properties managed or operated for sports leagues include NBA.com, NBA Mobile and NCAA.com.

Content and Other

Turner licenses certain owned original programming to international territories and to subscription VOD (referred to as “SVOD”) services. Turner also licenses its brands and characters for consumer products and other business ventures.

Home Box Office – Our Home Box Office business unit owns and operates leading multichannel premium pay television services, HBO and Cinemax. Our Home Box Office business unit revenue includes the following categories: subscription and content and other.

We also hold an 88 percent interest in HBO Latin America Group (HBO LAG), which owns and operates various television channels in Latin America. We account for this investment under the equity method of accounting. In October 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in HBO LAG, which we expect to close in the second half of 2020, pending regulatory approval.

Subscription

In the U.S., HBO and Cinemax programming is available to subscribers of traditional distributors for viewing live and on demand on television and on various internet-connected devices. Home Box Office contracts with a number of digital distributors to provide their subscribers programming on digital platforms and devices. HBO NOW, a domestic stand-alone OTT service, is provided through digital distributors, such as Apple, Google, Amazon and Roku, as well as by some affiliates. At December 31, 2019, Home Box Office had approximately 43 million domestic subscribers, including HBO NOW. We expect to launch our streaming platform HBO Max in May 2020 to provide comprehensive video options for all audience demographics.

Home Box Office’s domestic license agreements with distributors are typically multi-year arrangements that provide for annual service fee increases and marketing support. Revenues depend on the specific terms of the applicable agreement, which may include subscriber thresholds, volume discounts and other performance-based discounts.

Internationally, one or more of the following distribution models are used: premium pay and basic tier television services delivered by traditional distributors, licensing of programming to third-party providers, OTT services distributed by third parties and direct-to-consumer OTT services. HBO and Cinemax-branded premium pay, basic tier television and/or OTT services are distributed in over 70 countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia. Home Box Office had approximately 97 million international premium pay, basic tier television service and OTT service subscribers at December 31, 2019, including subscribers through Home Box Office’s unconsolidated joint ventures. The amount of its international subscription revenues depends on factors such as basic and/or pay television subscribers, performance-based or volume discounts, negotiated minimum guarantees or flat-fee arrangements.

Content and Other

Original programming is licensed to television networks and OTT services in over 150 countries, Original programming also is available to customers in both physical and digital formats in the U.S. and various international regions through a wide variety of digital storefronts and traditional retailers.

Warner Bros. – Our Warner Bros. business unit is one of the largest television and film studios in the world. Warner Bros. produces, distributes and licenses television programming and feature films and distributes home entertainment products in both physical and digital formats, as well as producing and distributing games and licensing consumer products and brands. Warner Bros. will allow us to offer an expanded library of programming available under HBO Max, our streaming platform that will launch in May 2020.

At December 31, 2019, Warner Bros.’ vast content library consists of more than 100,000 hours of programming, including over 8,600 feature films and 5,000 television programs comprised of tens of thousands of individual episodes.

The home entertainment industry is rapidly moving toward digital formats. While consumer spending on the higher-margin digital formats has increased in recent years, it has not offset decline in spending on product in physical formats, like DVDs. As such, Warner Bros. has been focusing on increasing the more profitable electronic sell-through and transactional digital VOD rentals of its film and television content while executing on opportunities to improve the operational efficiency of the physical distribution business.

Our Warner Bros. business unit revenue includes the following categories: theatrical product, television product, and games and other.

Theatrical Product

Theatrical product consists of (1) rental fees paid by movie theaters for the initial exhibition of feature films produced (or co-produced) and/or distributed by Warner Bros., (2) licensing fees paid by television networks, premium pay television services and OTT services for the exhibition of feature films produced or co-produced by Warner Bros. and (3) revenues from the distribution of Warner Bros.’ and other companies’ feature films in physical and digital formats. Our feature films also support Warner Bros.’ key brands and franchises, which helps generate consumer product and brand licensing revenues based on Warner Bros.’ films and characters.

Television Product

Television product consists of (1) fees for the initial broadcast of television programming on U.S. broadcast and cable television networks and premium pay television and OTT services, (2) fees for the airing or other distribution of television programming after the initial broadcast in secondary U.S. distribution channels (such as basic cable networks, local television stations and OTT services), (3) fees for the international distribution of television programming for free-to-air television, basic tier television services, premium pay television services and OTT services, and (4) revenues from the sale of the television programming in physical and digital formats. Our television programming also supports Warner Bros.’ key brands and franchises, which helps generate consumer product and brand licensing revenues based on the programming for years beyond the initial airing of the programming on television. Warner Bros. licenses its U.S. programming globally.

Games and Other

We develop, publishes and distribute games, including mobile and console games. The games are based on intellectual property owned or licensed by Warner Bros. (including DC Entertainment properties, Harry Potter and Mortal Kombat).

Additional information on our WarnerMedia segment is contained in the “Overview” section of Item 7.

LATIN AMERICA

Our Latin America segment provides entertainment services in Latin America and wireless services in Mexico. The Latin America segment provided approximately 4% of 2019 segment operating revenues. Our Latin America services and products are marketed under the AT&T, DIRECTV, SKY and Unefon brand names. This segment contains the Mexico and Vrio business units.

Mexico – We utilize our regional and national wireless networks in Mexico to provide consumer and business customers with wireless data and voice communication services. We divide our revenue into the following categories: wireless service and wireless equipment.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Wireless communications providers in the United States must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within defined geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as adopted by the FCC. The FCC’s rules have a direct impact on whether the wireless industry has sufficient spectrum available to support the high-quality, innovative services our customers demand. Wireless licenses are issued for a fixed time period, typically ten years, and we must seek renewal of these licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies such as us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Additionally, while wireless communications providers’ prices and service offerings are generally not subject to regulation, the federal government and various states periodically consider new regulations and legislation relating to various aspects of wireless services.

The Communications Act of 1934 and other related acts give the FCC broad authority to regulate the U.S. operations of our satellite services, which are licensed by the FCC, and some of WarnerMedia’s businesses are also subject to obligations under the Communications Act and related FCC regulations.

Our ILEC subsidiaries are subject to regulation by state governments, which have the power to regulate intrastate rates and services, including local, long-distance and network access services, provided such state regulation is consistent with federal law. Some states have eliminated or reduced regulations on our retail offerings. In addition, many states have adopted legislation that enables us to provide IP-based video service through a single statewide or state-approved franchise to offer a competitive video product. These subsidiaries are also subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC with respect to intercarrier compensation, interconnection, and interstate and international rates and services, including interstate access charges. Access charges are a form of intercarrier compensation designed to reimburse our wireline subsidiaries for the use of their networks by other carriers.

Our subsidiaries operating outside the United States are subject to the jurisdiction of national and supranational regulatory authorities in the market where service is provided.

The following discussion highlights significant regulatory issues directly affecting our operations:

Communications Segment

Wireless

The industry-wide deployment of 5G technology, which is needed to satisfy extensive demand for video and internet access, will involve significant deployment of “small cell” equipment and therefore increase the need for local permitting processes that allow for the placement of small cell equipment on reasonable timelines and terms. Federal regulations also can delay and impede broadband services, including small cell equipment. In March, August and September 2018, the FCC adopted orders to streamline the wireless infrastructure review process in order to facilitate deployment of next-generation wireless facilities. Those orders have been appealed and the various appeals remain pending in the DC Circuit and 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. In addition, to date, 28 states and Puerto Rico have adopted legislation to facilitate small cell deployment.

Internet

In February 2015, the FCC released an order classifying both fixed and mobile consumer broadband internet access services as telecommunications services, subject to Title II of the Communications Act. This order, which represented a departure from longstanding bipartisan precedent, significantly expanded the FCC’s authority to regulate broadband internet access services, as well as internet interconnection arrangements. In December 2017, the FCC reversed its 2015 decision by reclassifying fixed and mobile consumer broadband services as information services and repealing most of the rules that were adopted in 2015. In lieu of broad conduct prohibitions, the order requires internet service providers to disclose information about their network practices and terms of service, including whether they block or throttle internet traffic or offer paid prioritization. Several parties appealed the FCC’s December 2017 decision. On October 1, 2019, the D.C. Circuit issued a unanimous opinion upholding the FCC’s reclassification of broadband as an information service, and its reliance on transparency requirements and competitive marketplace dynamics to safeguard net neutrality. While the court vacated the FCC’s express preemption of any state regulation of net neutrality, it nevertheless stressed that its ruling does not prevent the FCC or ISPs from relying on conflict preemption to invalidate particular state laws that are inconsistent with the FCC’s regulatory objectives and framework. The court also concluded that the FCC failed to satisfy its obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to consider the impact of its 2017 order in three discrete areas—public safety, the Lifeline program, and pole attachment regulation—and thus remanded it to the FCC for further proceedings on those issues,

but without disturbing the operative effect of that order. A number of states have adopted legislation that would reimpose the very rules the FCC repealed, and in some cases, establish additional requirements that go beyond the FCC’s February 2015 order. Additionally, some state governors have issued executive orders that effectively re-impose the repealed requirements. Suits have recently been filed concerning laws in California and Vermont, and other lawsuits are possible. The California and Vermont suits have been stayed pursuant to agreements by those states not to enforce their laws pending resolution of appeals of the FCC’s December 2017 order. If no one seeks rehearing or Supreme Court review of the D.C. Circuit’s decision, the foregoing litigation will recommence. We expect that additional states may seek to regulate net neutrality based on the D.C. Circuit’s decision. We will continue to support congressional action to codify a set of standard consumer rules for the internet.

Privacy-related legislation has been adopted or considered in a number of states. Legislative and regulatory action could result in increased costs of compliance, claims against broadband internet access service providers and others, and increased uncertainty in the value and availability of data. Effective as of January 1, 2020, a California state law gives California consumers the right to know what personal information is being collected about them, and whether and to whom it is sold or disclosed, and to access and request deletion of this information. Subject to certain exceptions, it also gives consumers the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information.

WarnerMedia Segment

WarnerMedia creates, owns and distributes intellectual property, including copyrights, trademarks and licenses of intellectual property. To protect its intellectual property, WarnerMedia relies on a combination of laws and license agreements. Outside the U.S., laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from country to country. The European Union Commission is pursuing legislative and regulatory initiatives that could impair Warner Bros.’ current country-by-country licensing approach in the European Union. Piracy, particularly of digital content, continues to threaten revenues from WarnerMedia’s products and services, as well as revenues from our pay TV business, and we work to limit that threat through a combination of approaches, including technological and legislative solutions. Outside the U.S., various laws and regulations, as well as trade agreements with the U.S., also apply to the distribution or licensing of feature films for exhibition in theaters and on broadcast and cable networks. For example, in certain countries, including China, laws and regulations limit the number of foreign films exhibited in such countries in a calendar year.

Additional information relating to regulation of our subsidiaries is contained under the headings “Operating Environment Overview” and “Regulatory Developments” of Item 7.

IMPORTANCE, DURATION AND EFFECT OF LICENSES

Certain of our subsidiaries own or have licenses to various patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property necessary to conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries also hold government-issued licenses or franchises to provide wireline, satellite or wireless services. Additional information relating to regulation affecting those rights is contained under the heading “Operating Environment Overview,” of Item 7. We actively pursue patents, trademarks and service marks to protect our intellectual property within the United States and abroad. We maintain a significant global portfolio of patents, trademarks and service mark registrations. We have also entered into agreements that permit other companies, in exchange for fees and rights, and subject to appropriate safeguards and restrictions, to utilize certain of our patents, trademarks and service marks. As we transition our network from a switch-based network to an IP, software-based network, we have increasingly entered into licensing agreements with software developers.

We periodically receive offers from third parties to obtain licenses for patents and other intellectual rights in exchange for royalties or other payments. We also receive notices asserting that our products or services sold to customers or software-based network functions infringe on their patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims, whether against us directly, such as network functions or against third-party suppliers of products or services that we, in turn, sell to our customers, such as wireless handsets, could require us to pay damages, royalties, stop offering the relevant products or services and/or cease network functions or other activities. While the outcome of any litigation is uncertain, we do not

believe that the resolution of any of these infringement claims or the expiration or non-renewal of any of our intellectual property rights would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

MAJOR CUSTOMERS

No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenues in 2019, 2018 or 2017.

COMPETITION

Competition continues to increase for communications, media entertainment and digital services from traditional and nontraditional competitors. Technological advances have expanded the types and uses of services and products available. In addition, lack of or a reduced level of regulation of comparable legacy services has lowered costs for alternative communications service providers. As a result, we face continuing competition as well as some new opportunities in significant portions of our business.

Wireless We face substantial competition in our wireless businesses. Under current FCC rules, multiple licensees, who provide wireless services on the cellular, PCS, Advanced Wireless Services, 700 MHz and other spectrum bands, may operate in each of our U.S. service areas. Our competitors include three national wireless providers; a larger number of regional providers and resellers of those services; and specifically certain cable companies. In addition, we face competition from providers who offer voice, text messaging and other services as applications on data networks. Substantially all of the U.S. population lives in areas with at least three mobile telephone operators, with most of the population living in areas with at least four competing carriers. We are one of three facilities-based providers in Mexico, with the most significant market share controlled by América Móvil. We may experience significant competition from companies that provide similar services using other communications technologies and services. While some of these technologies and services are now operational, others are being developed or may be developed. We compete for customers based principally on service/device offerings, price, network quality, coverage area and customer service.

Video/Broadband Our subsidiaries providing communications and digital entertainment services will face continued competitive pressure in 2020 from multiple providers, including wireless, satellite, cable, online video providers, and resellers. In addition, the desire for high-speed data on demand, including video, is continuing to lead customers to terminate their traditional wired or linear services and use our or competitors’ wireless, satellite and internet-based services. We have launched our own video OTT and/or streaming options to attract or retain customers that do not want a full-scale traditional video package. In most U.S. markets, we compete for customers with large cable companies for high-speed internet, video and voice services and other smaller telecommunications companies for both long-distance and local services. In addition, in Latin American countries served by our DIRECTV subsidiary, we also face competition from other video providers, including América Móvil and Telefónica.

Legacy Voice and Data We continue to lose legacy voice and data subscribers due to competitors (e.g., wireless, cable and VoIP providers) who can provide comparable services at lower prices because they are not subject to traditional telephone industry regulation (or the extent of regulation they are subject to is in dispute), utilize different technologies or promote a different business model (such as advertising based). In response to these competitive pressures, for a number of years we have used a bundling strategy that rewards customers who consolidate their services with us. We continue to focus on bundling services, including combined packages of wireless and video service through our satellite and IP-based services. We will continue to develop innovative and integrated services that capitalize on our wireless and IP-based network and satellites.

Additionally, we provide local and interstate telephone and switched services to other service providers, primarily large internet service providers using the largest class of nationwide internet networks (internet backbone), wireless carriers, other telephone companies, cable companies and systems integrators. These services are subject to additional competitive pressures from the development of new technologies, the introduction of innovative offerings and increasing satellite, wireless, fiber-optic and cable transmission capacity for services. We face a number of international competitors, including Orange Business Services, BT, Singapore Telecommunications Limited and Verizon Communications Inc., as well as competition from a number of large systems integrators.

Media Our WarnerMedia businesses face similar shifts in consumer viewing patterns, increased competition from streaming services and the expansion by other companies, in particular, technology companies. In May 2020, we plan to launch HBO

Max, our new platform for premium content and video offered directly to consumers, as well as through our traditional distributors.

WarnerMedia competes with other studios and television production groups and independents to produce and sell programming. Many television networks and online platforms have affiliated production companies from which they are increasingly obtaining their programming, which has reduced their demand for programming from non-affiliated production companies. WarnerMedia also faces competition from other television networks, online platforms, and premium pay television services for distribution and marketing of its television networks and premium pay and basic tier television services by affiliates. 

Our WarnerMedia businesses compete with other production companies and studios for the services of producers, directors, writers, actors and others and for the acquisition of literary properties. In recent years, technology companies also have begun to produce programming and compete with WarnerMedia for talent and property rights. 

Advertising The increased amount of consumer time spent online and on mobile activities has resulted in the shift of advertising budgets away from traditional television to digital advertising. WarnerMedia’s advertising-supported television networks and digital properties compete with streaming services, other networks and digital properties, print, radio and other media. Our programmatic advertising business faces competition from a variety of technology companies. Similar to all participants in the advertising technology sector, we contend with the dominance of Google, as well as the influence of Facebook, whose practices may result in the decreased ability and willingness of advertisers and programmers to adopt programmatic solutions offered by alternative suppliers.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

AT&T scientists and engineers conduct research in a variety of areas, including IP networking, advanced network design and architecture, network and cyber security, network operations support systems, satellite technology, video platform development and data analytics. The majority of the development activities are performed to create new services and to invent tools and systems to manage secure and reliable networks for us and our customers. Research and development expenses were $1,276 in 2019, $1,194 in 2018, and $1,503 in 2017.

EMPLOYEES

As of January 31, 2020, we employed approximately 246,000 persons. Approximately 40% of our employees are represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA), the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) or other unions. After expiration of the agreements, work stoppages or labor disruptions may occur in the absence of new contracts or other agreements being reached. A contract covering approximately 7,000 traditional wireline employees in our Midwest region expired in April 2018. In August 2019, a new four-year contract was ratified by employees and will expire in April 2022. A contract covering approximately 3,000 traditional wireline employees in our legacy AT&T Corp. business expired in April 2018. In August 2019, a new four-year contract was ratified by employees and will expire in April 2022. A contract covering approximately 18,000 traditional wireline employees in our Southeast region expired in August 2019. In October 2019, a new five-year contract was ratified by employees and will expire in August 2024. Other contracts covering approximately 20,000 employees are scheduled to expire during 2020, including a contract expiring in February covering approximately 7,000 Mobility employees and a contract expiring in April covering approximately 13,000 traditional wireline employees in our West region.

At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 540,000 retirees and dependents that were eligible to receive retiree benefits.
