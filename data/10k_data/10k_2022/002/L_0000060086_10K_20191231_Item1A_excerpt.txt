Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Our business and the businesses of our subsidiaries face many risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could lead to events or circumstances that have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition or equity and/or the business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, or equity of one or more of our subsidiaries. We have described below the most significant risks facing us and our subsidiaries. There may be additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we do not currently perceive to be as significant that may also impact our business or the businesses of our subsidiaries.  

You should carefully consider and evaluate all of the information included in this Report and any subsequent reports we may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the information we make available to the public before investing in any securities issued by us. Our subsidiaries, CNA Financial Corporation, Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP, also file reports with the SEC. You are also cautioned to carefully review and consider the information contained in the reports filed by those subsidiaries with the SEC and the information they make available to the public before investing in any of their securities.  

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, CNA  

If CNA determines that its recorded insurance reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, CNA may need to increase its insurance reserves which would result in a charge to CNA’s earnings.  

CNA maintains insurance reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for reported and unreported claims. Insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex management estimates developed utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques as of a given reporting date. The reserve estimation process involves a high degree of judgment and variability and is subject to a number of factors which are highly uncertain. These variables can be affected by both changes in internal processes and external events. Key variables include frequency of claims, claim severity, mortality, morbidity, discount rates, inflation, claim handling policies and procedures, case reserving approach, underwriting and pricing policies, changes in the legal and regulatory environment and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time of its ultimate settlement. Mortality is the relative incidence of death. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.  

There is generally a higher degree of variability in estimating required reserves for long-tail coverages, such as general liability and workers’ compensation, as they require a relatively longer period of time for claims to be reported and settled. The impact of changes in inflation and medical costs are also more pronounced for long-tail coverages due to the longer settlement period. Certain risks and uncertainties associated with CNA’s insurance reserves are outlined in the Insurance Reserves and Critical Accounting Estimates sections of MD&A in Item 7.  

CNA is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as industry practices and legal, judicial, social, economic and other environmental conditions change. These issues have had, and may continue to have, a negative effect on CNA’s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims, resulting in further increases in CNA’s reserves. The effects of unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely difficult to predict.  

In light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the judgments necessary to establish reserve levels, CNA continually reviews and changes its reserve estimates in a regular and ongoing process as experience develops from the actual reporting and settlement of claims and as the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. If CNA’s recorded reserves are insufficient for any reason, the required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against its earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.

CNA’s actual experience could vary from the key assumptions used to determine active life reserves for long term care policies.  

CNA’s active life reserves for long term care policies are based on CNA’s best estimate assumptions as of September 30, 2019, due to a reserve unlocking at that date. Key assumptions include morbidity, persistency (the percentage of policies remaining in force), discount rate and future premium rate increases. These assumptions, which are critical bases for its reserve estimates are inherently uncertain. If actual experience varies from these assumptions or the future outlook for these assumptions changes, CNA may be required to increase its reserves. See the Long Term Care Policyholder Reserves portion of the Insurance Reserves section of MD&A in Item 7 for more information.  

Estimating future experience for long term care policies is highly uncertain, because the adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and CNA’s future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring CNA to add reserves. The required increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against its earnings in the period in which reserves are determined to be insufficient. These charges could be substantial.  

Morbidity and persistency experience, inclusive of mortality, can be volatile and may be negatively affected by many factors including, but not limited to, policyholder behavior, judicial decisions regarding policy terms, socioeconomic factors, cost of care inflation, changes in health trends and advances in medical care.  

A prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in CNA’s reserving would result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting CNA’s obligations under long term care policies, which may require changes to its reserves. This risk is more significant for CNA’s long term care products because the long potential duration of the policy obligations exceeds the duration of the supporting investment assets. Further, changes to the Internal Revenue Code may also affect the rate at which CNA discounts its reserves. In addition, CNA may not receive regulatory approval for the level of premium rate increases it requests. Any adverse deviation between the level of future premium rate increases approved and the level included in CNA’s reserving assumptions may require an increase to its reserves.  

CNA is vulnerable to material losses from natural and 

man-made disasters.  

Catastrophe losses are an inevitable part of CNA’s business. Various events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or 

man-made, and may include hurricanes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil commotion, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism. The frequency and severity of these catastrophe events are inherently unpredictable. In addition, longer-term natural catastrophe trends may be changing and new types of catastrophe losses may be developing due to climate change, a phenomenon that has been associated with extreme weather events linked to rising temperatures, and includes effects on global weather patterns, greenhouse gases, sea, land and air temperatures, sea levels, rain, hail and snow. 

The extent of CNA’s losses from catastrophes is a function of the total amount of its insured exposures in the affected areas, the frequency and severity of the events themselves, the level of reinsurance coverage, reinsurance reinstatement premiums and state residual market assessments, if any. It can take a long time for the ultimate cost of any catastrophe losses to CNA to be finally determined, as a multitude of factors contribute to such costs, including evaluation of general liability and pollution exposures, infrastructure disruption, business interruption and reinsurance collectibility. Reinsurance coverage for terrorism events is provided only in limited circumstances, especially in regard to “unconventional” terrorism acts, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks. CNA’s principal reinsurance protection against these large-scale terrorist attacks is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA through December 31, 2027. However, such coverage is subject to a mandatory deductible and other limitations. It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect CNA’s business by increasing its exposure to terrorism losses, or by lowering its business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure. For a further discussion of TRIPRA, see Part II, Item 7, MD&A - Catastrophes and Related Reinsurance. As a result of the items discussed above, catastrophe losses are particularly difficult to estimate. Additionally, catastrophic events could cause CNA to exhaust its available reinsurance limits and could adversely affect the cost and availability of reinsurance.

CNA has exposure related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses.  

CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have exposures related to A&EP claims. CNA’s experience has been that establishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for casualty coverages relating to A&EP claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other claims. Additionally, traditional actuarial methods and techniques employed to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for more traditional property and casualty exposures are less precise in estimating claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for A&EP. As a result, estimating the ultimate cost of both reported and unreported A&EP claims is subject to a higher degree of variability.  

On August 31, 2010, CNA completed a retroactive reinsurance transaction under which substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., subject to an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion (“loss portfolio transfer” or “LPT”). The cumulative amount ceded under the loss portfolio transfer as of December 31, 2019 is $3.2 billion. If the other parties to the loss portfolio transfer do not fully perform their obligations, net losses incurred on A&EP claims covered by the loss portfolio transfer exceed the aggregate limit of $4.0 billion or CNA determines it has exposures to A&EP claims not covered by the loss portfolio transfer, CNA may need to increase its recorded net reserves which would result in a charge against earnings. These charges could be substantial. Additionally, if the A&EP claims exceed the limit of the loss portfolio transfer, CNA will need to assess whether to purchase additional limit or to reassume claim handling responsibility for A&EP claims from an affiliate of NICO. Any additional reinsurance premium or future claim handling costs would also reduce CNA’s earnings.  

CNA is exposed to, and may face adverse developments related to, mass tort claims that could arise from its insureds’ sale or use of potentially harmful products or substances, changes to the social and legal environment, issues related to altered interpretation of coverage and other new and emerging claim theories.  

CNA faces potential exposure to various types of new and emerging mass tort claims including, but not limited to, those related to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances such as glyphosate, lead paint and opioids; claims arising from changes that expand the right to sue, remove limitations on recovery, extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise repeal or weaken tort reforms, such as those related to abuse reviver statutes; and claims related to new and emerging theories of liability, such as those related to global warming and climate change. Evolving judicial interpretations and new legislation regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liability, as well as the application of insurance coverage to these claims, give rise to new claimant activity. Emerging mass tort claim activity, including activity based on such changing judicial interpretations and recent and proposed legislation could materially and adversely affect CNA’s results of operations.  

CNA uses analytical models to assist its decision making in key areas such as pricing, reserving and capital modeling and may be adversely affected if actual results differ materially from the model outputs and related analyses.  

CNA uses various modeling techniques and data analytics (e.g., scenarios, predictive, stochastic and/or forecasting) to analyze and estimate exposures, loss trends and other risks associated with its assets and liabilities. This includes both proprietary and third party modeled outputs and related analyses to assist CNA in decision-making related to underwriting, pricing, capital allocation, reserving, investing, reinsurance and catastrophe risk, among other things. CNA incorporates numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of policyholder behavior, loss frequency and severity, interest rates, equity markets, inflation, capital requirements, and currency exchange rates, among others. The modeled outputs and related analyses from both proprietary models and third parties are subject to various assumptions, uncertainties, model design errors and the inherent limitations of any statistical analysis.  

In addition, the effectiveness of any model can be degraded by operational risks including, but not limited to, the improper use of the model, including input errors, data errors and human error. As a result, actual results may differ materially from CNA’s modeled results. The profitability and financial condition of CNA substantially depends on the extent to which its actual experience is consistent with the assumptions CNA uses in its models and ultimate model outputs. If, based upon these models or other factors, CNA misprices its products or fails to appropriately estimate the risks it is exposed to, its business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity may be materially adversely affected.

CNA faces intense competition in its industry.  

All aspects of the insurance industry are highly competitive and CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services to remain competitive. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities, some of which may be larger or have greater financial or other resources than CNA does, for both distributors and customers. This includes agents, brokers and managing general underwriters who may increasingly compete with CNA to the extent that they continue to have direct access to providers of capital seeking exposure to insurance risk. Insurers compete on the basis of many factors, including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. The competitor landscape has evolved substantially in recent years, with significant consolidation and new market entrants, resulting in increased pressures on CNA’s ability to remain competitive, particularly in obtaining pricing that is both attractive to CNA’s customer base and risk appropriate to CNA.  

The property and casualty market is cyclical and has experienced periods characterized by relatively high levels of price competition, resulting in less restrictive underwriting standards and relatively low premium rates, followed by periods of relatively lower levels of competition, more selective underwriting standards and relatively high premium rates. During periods in which price competition is high, CNA may lose business to competitors offering competitive insurance products at lower prices. As a result, CNA’s premium levels and expense ratio could be materially adversely impacted.  

CNA markets its insurance products worldwide primarily through independent insurance agents, insurance brokers and managing general underwriters who also promote and distribute the products of CNA’s competitors. Any change in CNA’s relationships with its distribution network agents, brokers or managing general underwriters including as a result of consolidation and their increased promotion and distribution of CNA’s competitors’ products, could adversely affect CNA’s ability to sell its products. As a result, CNA’s business volume and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.  

CNA may be adversely affected by technological changes or disruptions in the insurance marketplace.  

Technological changes in the way insurance transactions are completed in the marketplace, and CNA’s ability to react effectively to such change, may present significant competitive risks. For example, more insurers are utilizing “big data” analytics to make underwriting and other decisions that impact product design and pricing. If such utilization is more effective than how CNA uses similar data and information, CNA will be at a competitive disadvantage. There can be no assurance that CNA will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes; accordingly this may have a material adverse effect on CNA’s business and results of operations.  

In addition, agents and brokers, technology companies or other third parties may create alternate distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing. For example, they may create a digitally enabled distribution channel that may adversely impact CNA’s competitive position. CNA’s efforts or the efforts of agents and brokers with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the way agents and brokers utilize greater levels of data and technology, could adversely impact CNA’s business relationships with independent agents and brokers who currently market its products, resulting in a lower volume and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.  

CNA may not be able to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions it deems acceptable, which could result in increased exposure to risk or a decrease in CNA’s underwriting commitments.  

A primary reason CNA purchases reinsurance is to manage its exposure to risk. Under CNA’s ceded reinsurance arrangements, another insurer assumes a specified portion of CNA’s exposure in exchange for a specified portion of policy premiums. Market conditions determine the availability and cost of the reinsurance protection CNA purchases, which affects the level of its business and profitability, as well as the level and types of risk CNA retains. If CNA is unable to obtain sufficient reinsurance at a cost or on terms and conditions it deems acceptable, CNA may have increased exposure to risk. Alternatively, CNA may be unwilling to bear the increased risk and would reduce the level of its underwriting commitments.

CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by reinsurers, which could result in higher net incurred losses.  

CNA has significant amounts recoverable from reinsurers which are reported as receivables on its balance sheets and are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves. The ceding of insurance does not, however, discharge CNA’s primary liability for claims. As a result, CNA is subject to credit risk relating to its ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers. Certain of CNA’s reinsurance carriers could experience credit downgrades by rating agencies within the term of CNA’s contractual relationship, which would indicate an increase in the likelihood that CNA would not be able to recover amounts due. In addition, reinsurers could dispute amounts which CNA believes are due to it. If the amounts collected from reinsurers, including any collateral, are less than the amounts recorded by CNA, its net incurred losses will be higher.  

CNA may not be able to collect amounts owed to it by policyholders who hold deductible policies and/or who purchase retrospectively rated policies, which could result in higher net incurred losses.  

A portion of CNA’s business is written under deductible policies. Under these policies, CNA is obligated to pay the related insurance claims and is reimbursed by the policyholder to the extent of the deductible, which may be significant. Moreover, certain policyholders purchase retrospectively rated workers’ compensation policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience of the policyholder during the policy period). Retrospectively rated policies expose CNA to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium, which may be significant. As a result, CNA is exposed to policyholder credit risk. If the amounts collected from policyholders, including any collateral, are less than the amounts recorded by CNA, CNA’s net incurred losses will be higher.  

CNA may incur significant realized and unrealized investment losses and volatility in net investment income arising from changes in the financial markets.  

CNA’s investment portfolio is exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, credit spread, issuer default, equity prices and foreign currency, which are unpredictable. Financial markets are highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions, monetary policies, tax policies, domestic and international geopolitical issues and many other factors. Changes in financial markets including fluctuations in interest rates, credit, equity prices and foreign currency prices, and many other factors beyond CNA’s control can adversely affect the value of its investments, the realization of investment income and the rate at which it discounts certain liabilities.  

CNA has significant holdings in fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. A decline in interest rates may reduce the returns earned on new fixed maturity investments, thereby reducing CNA’s net investment income, while an increase in interest rates may reduce the value of its existing fixed maturity investments, which could reduce CNA’s net unrealized gains included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”). The value of CNA’s fixed maturity investments is also subject to risk that certain investments may default or become impaired due to deterioration in the financial condition of issuers of the investments CNA holds or in the underlying collateral of the security.  

In addition, CNA invests a portion of its assets in limited partnerships which are subject to greater market volatility than its fixed maturity investments. Limited partnership investments generally provide a lower level of liquidity than fixed maturity or equity investments, which may also limit CNA’s ability to withdraw funds from these investments. The timing and amount of income or losses on such investments is inherently variable and can contribute to volatility in reported earnings.  

Further, CNA holds a portfolio of commercial mortgage loans. CNA is subject to risk related to the recoverability of loan balances, which is influenced by declines in the estimated cash flows from underlying property leases, fair value of collateral, refinancing risk and the creditworthiness of tenants of the underlying properties, where lease payments directly service the loan. Collecting amounts from borrowers that are less than the amounts recorded would result in a charge to earnings.  

As a result of these factors, CNA may not earn an adequate return on its investments, may be required to write down the value of its investments and may incur losses on the disposition of its investments, all of which would result in a charge to CNA’s earnings.

Inability to detect and prevent significant employee or third party service provider misconduct, inadvertent errors and omissions, or exposure relating to functions performed on CNA’s behalf could result in a material adverse effect on CNA’s operations.  

CNA may incur losses which arise from employees or third party service providers engaging in intentional misconduct, fraud, errors and omissions, failure to comply with internal guidelines, including with respect to underwriting authority, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements. CNA’s controls may not be able to detect all possible circumstances of employee and third party service provider 

non-compliant activity and the internal structures in place to prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. Any losses relating to such 

non-compliant activity could adversely affect CNA’s results of operations. 

Portions of CNA’s insurance business is underwritten and serviced by third parties. With respect to underwriting, CNA’s contractual arrangements with third parties will typically grant them limited rights to write new and renewal policies, subject to contractual restrictions and obligations and requiring them to underwrite within the terms of CNA’s licenses. Should these third parties issue policies that exceed these contractual restrictions, CNA could be deemed liable for such policies and subject to regulatory fines and penalties for any breach of licensing requirements. It is possible that in such circumstance CNA might not be fully indemnified for such third parties’ contractual breaches.  

Additionally, CNA relies on certain third-party claims administrators, including the administrators of its long term care claims, to perform significant claim administration and claim adjudication functions. Any failure by such administrator to properly perform service functions may result in losses as a result of over-payment of claims, legal claims against CNA and adverse regulatory enforcement exposure. CNA has also licensed certain systems from third parties. CNA cannot be certain that it will have access to these systems or that its information technology or application systems will continue to operate as intended. These risks could adversely impact CNA’s reputation or client relationships or have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.  

CNA is subject to capital adequacy requirements and, if it is unable to maintain or raise sufficient capital to meet these requirements, regulatory agencies may restrict or prohibit CNA from operating its business.  

Insurance companies such as CNA are subject to capital adequacy standards set by regulators to help identify companies that merit further regulatory attention. In the U.S., these standards apply specified risk factors to various asset, premium and reserve components of CNA’s legal entity statutory basis of accounting financial statements. Current rules, including those promulgated by insurance regulators and specialized markets such as Lloyd’s, require companies to maintain statutory capital and surplus at a specified minimum level determined using the applicable jurisdiction’s regulatory capital adequacy formula. If CNA does not meet these minimum requirements, CNA may be restricted or prohibited from operating its business in the applicable jurisdictions and specialized markets. If CNA is required to record a material charge against earnings in connection with a change in estimated insurance reserves, the occurrence of a catastrophic event or if it incurs significant losses related to its investment portfolio, which severely deteriorates its capital position, CNA may violate these minimum capital adequacy requirements unless it is able to raise sufficient additional capital. CNA may be limited in its ability to raise significant amounts of capital on favorable terms or at all.  

The IAIS recently adopted a common framework for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups and continues to develop a group basis Insurance Capital Standard (“ICS”). The NAIC is also developing a group capital standard that is intended to be comparable to the ICS. The development and adoption of these capital standards could increase CNA’s prescribed capital requirement, the level at which regulatory scrutiny intensifies, as well as significantly increase its cost of regulatory compliance.  

CNA’s insurance subsidiaries, upon whom CNA depends for dividends in order to fund its corporate obligations, are limited by insurance regulators in their ability to pay dividends.  

CNA is a holding company and is dependent upon dividends, loans and other sources of cash from its subsidiaries in order to meet its obligations. Ordinary dividend payments or dividends that do not require prior approval by the insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary insurance regulator are generally limited to amounts determined by formulas that vary by jurisdiction. If CNA is restricted from paying or receiving intercompany dividends, by regulatory rule or otherwise, CNA may not be able to fund its corporate obligations and debt service requirements or pay stockholder   

21 

Table of Contents  

dividends from available cash. As a result, CNA would need to look to other sources of capital which may be more expensive or may not be available at all.  

Rating agencies may downgrade their ratings of CNA and thereby adversely affect its ability to write insurance at competitive rates or at all.  

Ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies. CNA’s insurance company subsidiaries, as well as CNA’s public debt, are rated by rating agencies, including, A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”). Ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinions of an insurance company’s or insurance holding company’s financial strength, capital adequacy, enterprise risk management practices, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and debt holders.  

The rating agencies may take action to lower CNA’s ratings in the future as a result of any significant financial loss or possible changes in the methodology or criteria applied by the rating agencies. The severity of the impact on CNA’s business is dependent on the level of downgrade and, for certain products, which rating agency takes the rating action. Among the adverse effects in the event of such downgrades would be the inability to obtain a material volume of business from certain major insurance brokers, the inability to sell a material volume of CNA’s insurance products to certain markets and the required collateralization of certain future payment obligations or reserves.  

In addition, it is possible that a significant lowering of our corporate debt ratings by certain of the rating agencies could result in an adverse effect on CNA’s ratings, independent of any change in CNA’s circumstances.  

CNA is subject to extensive regulations that restrict its ability to do business and generate revenues.  

The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of CNA’s policyholders and third-party claimants rather than its investors. Each jurisdiction in which CNA does business has established supervisory agencies that regulate the manner in which CNA conducts its business. Any changes in regulation could impose significant burdens on CNA. In addition, the Lloyd’s marketplace sets rules under which its members, including CNA’s Hardy syndicate, operate.  

These rules and regulations relate to, among other things, the standards of solvency (including risk-based capital measures), government-supported backstops for certain catastrophic events (including terrorism), investment restrictions, accounting and reporting methodology, establishment of reserves and potential assessments of funds to settle covered claims against impaired, insolvent or failed private or quasi-governmental insurers.  

Regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. State jurisdictions ensure compliance with such regulations through market conduct exams, which may result in losses to the extent 

non-compliance is ascertained, either as a result of failure to document transactions properly or failure to comply with internal guidelines, or otherwise. CNA may also be required by the jurisdictions in which it does business to provide coverage to persons who would not otherwise be considered eligible or restrict CNA from withdrawing from unprofitable lines of business or unprofitable market areas. Each jurisdiction dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each jurisdiction. 

The United Kingdom’s expected exit from the European Union is expected to increase the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance of CNA’s European business.  

In 2016, the U.K. approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit.” While the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. was official as of January 31, 2020, until the transition period ends, there remains a lack of specificity and detail regarding the long term relationship between the two sides and how businesses operating in both jurisdictions may be affected. In any event, effective January 1, 2019, CNA’s E.U. business is no longer handled out of CNA’s U.K. domiciled subsidiary but through its European subsidiary in Luxembourg which was established specifically to address the departure of the U.K. from the E.U. and to ensure CNA’s ability to operate effectively throughout the E.U. As a result, the complexity and cost of regulatory compliance of its European business has increased and will likely continue to result in elevated expenses.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Diamond Offshore  

The current protracted downturn in Diamond Offshore’s industry may continue for several more years and it cannot predict if or when it will end.  

Over the past several years, crude oil prices have been volatile, reaching a high of $115 per barrel in 2014, declining to $55 per barrel by the end of 2014 and reaching a low of $28 per barrel during 2016. Oil prices recovered to nearly $57 per barrel by the end of 2016 and have continued to fluctuate. As of the date of this Report, Brent crude oil prices were in the mid $50 per barrel range, having started 2020 in the 

mid-to-upper $60 per barrel range. As a result of, among other things, this continued volatility in commodity price and its uncertain future, the offshore drilling industry has experienced, and is continuing to experience, a substantial decline in demand for its services, as well as a significant decline in dayrates for contract drilling services. The decline in demand for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services and the dayrates for those services has had, and if the industry downturn continues, will continue to have, a material adverse effect on its business. The protracted downturn in Diamond Offshore’s industry will exacerbate many of the other risks included below and other risks that it faces, and Diamond Offshore cannot predict if or when the downturn will end. 

The worldwide demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services has historically been dependent on the price of oil and, as a result of low oil prices, demand has continued to be depressed in 2019, and there continues a protracted downturn in its industry.  

Demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services depends in large part upon the oil and natural gas industry’s offshore exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in oil and gas prices. Beginning in the second half of 2014, oil prices declined significantly, resulting in a sharp decline in the demand for offshore drilling services, including services that Diamond Offshore provides, and materially adversely affecting Diamond Offshore’s operations and cash flows compared to years before the decline. The continuation of low oil prices would make more severe the downturn in Diamond Offshore’s industry and would continue to materially adversely affect many of its customers and, therefore, demand for its services and on its business.  

Oil prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control.  

Although, historically, higher sustained commodity prices have generally resulted in increases in offshore drilling projects, short term or temporary increases in the price of oil and gas will not necessarily result in an increase in offshore drilling activity or an increase in the market demand for Diamond Offshore’s rigs. The timing of commitment to offshore activity in a cycle depends on project deployment times, reserve replacement needs, availability of capital and alternative options for resource development, among other things. Timing can also be affected by availability, access to, and cost of equipment to perform work.  

Diamond Offshore’s business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been cyclical, is currently in a protracted downturn and is significantly affected by many factors outside of its control.  

Demand for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services depends upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide, and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices, worldwide demand for oil and gas and a variety of political and economic factors. The level of offshore drilling activity is adversely affected when operators reduce or defer new investment in offshore projects, reduce or suspend their drilling budgets or reallocate their drilling budgets away from offshore drilling in favor of other priorities, such as shale or other land-based projects. As a result, Diamond Offshore’s business and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to cyclical fluctuations.  

As a result of the cyclical fluctuations in the market, there have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and lower dayrates, followed by periods of higher demand, shorter rig supply and higher dayrates. Diamond Offshore cannot predict the timing or duration of such fluctuations. Periods of lower demand or excess rig supply, such as the current protracted downturn in Diamond Offshore’s industry that is continuing and may continue for several more years, intensify the competition in the industry and often result in periods of lower utilization and lower dayrates.   

23 

Table of Contents 

During these periods, Diamond Offshore’s rigs may not be able to obtain contracts for future work and may be idle for long periods of time or may be able to obtain work only under contracts with lower dayrates or less favorable terms. Additionally, prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates (such as Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing) have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the recognition of further impairment charges on certain of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable.  

Diamond Offshore’s industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply and intense price competition.  

The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, and such competitiveness may be exacerbated by the current protracted downturn in Diamond Offshore’s industry. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors are larger companies, have larger or more technologically advanced fleets and have greater financial or other resources than it does. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job.  

As of the date of this Report, there are approximately 240 floater rigs currently available to meet customer drilling needs in the offshore contract drilling market, and many of these rigs are not currently contracted and/or are cold stacked. Although there have been over 135 floater rigs scrapped over the past six years, the market remains oversupplied as new rig construction, upgrades of existing drilling rigs, cancelation or termination of drilling contracts and established rigs coming off contract have contributed to the current oversupply, intensifying price competition. In addition, some shipyards own rigs recently constructed or under construction, which are not currently marketed, which, if acquired by Diamond Offshore or its competitors, would further exacerbate the oversupply of rigs. In addition, during industry downturns like the one Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing, rig operators may take lower dayrates and shorter contract durations to keep their rigs operational.  

Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance that its drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that its current backlog of contract drilling revenue will be ultimately realized.  

Diamond Offshore’s customers may terminate their drilling contracts under certain circumstances, such as the destruction or loss of a drilling rig or suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment, excessive downtime for repairs, failure to meet minimum performance criteria (including customer acceptance testing) or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party.  

In addition, some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods, often by tendering contractually specified termination amounts, which may not fully compensate Diamond Offshore for the loss of the contract. In some cases, Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts may permit the customer to terminate the contract without cause, upon little or no notice or without making an early termination payment. During depressed market conditions, such as those currently in effect, certain customers have utilized, and may in the future utilize, such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that Diamond Offshore has breached provisions of its drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to Diamond Offshore under circumstances where Diamond Offshore believes it is in compliance with the contracts. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond Diamond Offshore’s control, a customer may no longer want or need a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower dayrate. For these reasons, customers have sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate the terms of Diamond Offshore’s existing drilling contracts, terminate their contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. As a result of such contract renegotiations or terminations, Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog has been and may in the future be adversely impacted, it might not recover any compensation (or any recovery it obtains may not fully compensate it for the loss of the contract) and it may be required to idle one or more rigs for an extended period of time.

Diamond Offshore may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for its rigs.  

As of the date of this Report, all of Diamond Offshore’s current customer contracts will expire between 2020 and 2023. Two of Diamond Offshore’s contracts expire in 2020, six contracts expire in 2021 and two contracts expire in each of 2022 and 2023. Some of Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are not currently contracted for continuous utilization between contracts and are being actively marketed for these uncontracted periods. Diamond Offshore’s ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of its customers at such times. Given the historically cyclical and highly competitive nature of the industry and the likelihood that the current protracted downturn in Diamond Offshore’s industry continues, it may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or it may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at dayrates that are below existing dayrates, or that have terms that are less favorable, including shorter durations, than existing contracts. Moreover, Diamond Offshore may be unable to secure contracts for these rigs. Failure to secure contracts for a rig may result in a decision to cold stack the rig, which puts the rig at risk for impairment and may competitively disadvantage the rig as many customers during the current protracted market downturn have expressed a preference for ready or “warm” stacked rigs over cold stacked rigs. If a decision is made to cold stack a rig, Diamond Offshore’s operating costs for the rig are typically reduced, however, it will incur additional costs associated with cold stacking the rig (particularly if it cold stacks a newer rig, such as a drillship or other DP semisubmersible rig, for which cold stacking costs are typically substantially higher than for an older 

non-DP rig). In addition, the costs to reactivate a cold stacked rig may be substantial. 

Diamond Offshore’s debt levels may limit its liquidity and flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.  

Diamond Offshore’s business is highly capital intensive and dependent on having sufficient cash flow and/or available sources of financing in order to fund its capital expenditure requirements. During 2019, Diamond Offshore’s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased an aggregate $301 million and during 2018 increased an aggregate $74 million. Based on its cash flow forecast, as of the date of this Report, Diamond Offshore expects to generate aggregate negative cash flows for 2020. If market conditions do not improve, it could continue to generate aggregate negative cash flows in future periods.  

As of December 31, 2019, Diamond Offshore had outstanding $2.0 billion of senior notes, maturing at various times from 2023 through 2043. As of February 7, 2020, Diamond Offshore had no outstanding borrowings under its $225 million revolving credit facility maturing in October of 2020, which it may have difficulty replacing upon maturity, or its $950 million revolving credit facility maturing in October of 2023. Diamond Offshore expects to begin to utilize borrowing under its two credit agreements in the first half of 2020 to meet its liquidity requirements and anticipates ending 2020 with a drawn balance under its $950 million credit agreement. As of February 7, 2020, Diamond Offshore had approximately $1.2 billion available under such credit facilities in the aggregate, subject to their respective terms, to meet its short term liquidity requirements.  

Diamond Offshore’s ability to meet its debt service obligations is dependent upon its future performance, which is unpredictable and dependent on its ability to manage through the current protracted industry downturn. Diamond Offshore’s levels of indebtedness could have negative consequences to Diamond Offshore, including:  

   ● 

it may have difficulty satisfying its obligations with respect to its outstanding debt and, given the challenges to its business presented by the protracted industry downturn, its operational obligations;   

   ● 

it may have difficulty obtaining financing, including refinancing for its existing indebtedness upon maturity in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes;   

   ● 

it may need to use a substantial portion of available cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on its debt, which would reduce the amount of money available to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate or business activities;   

   ● 

vulnerability to the effects of general adverse economic conditions, such as the continuing protracted industry downturn, and adverse operating results, including negative cash flows, could increase;   

25 

Table of Contents 

   ● 

flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and in its industry in general could be limited;   

   ● 

it may not have the ability to pursue business opportunities that become available;   

   ● 

the amount of debt and the amount it must pay to service its debt obligations could place Diamond Offshore at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have less debt; and   

   ● 

customers may react adversely to its significant debt level and seek alternative service providers.   

In addition, Diamond Offshore’s failure to comply with the restrictive covenants in its debt instruments could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on its business. Among other things, these covenants require Diamond Offshore to maintain a specified ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization, a specified ratio of the aggregate value of certain of its rigs to the aggregate value of substantially all rigs owned by Diamond Offshore, a specified ratio of the aggregate value of certain of its marketed rigs to the sum of the commitments under the $950 million revolving credit facility plus certain outstanding loans, letter of credit exposures and other indebtedness, limit the ability of its subsidiaries to incur debt and require Diamond Offshore to make a cash collateral deposit if a change in control occurs, as defined in each respective credit facility, within 90 days of the change in control event. The amount of such cash collateral deposit is based on its credit ratings within 90 days of such change in control event.  

In 2019, S&P downgraded Diamond Offshore’s corporate and senior unsecured notes credit rating to CCC+ from B and the rating outlook changed to stable from negative. Diamond Offshore’s current corporate credit rating from Moody’s is B2 and its current senior unsecured notes credit rating from Moody’s is B3. The rating outlook from Moody’s is negative. These credit ratings are below investment grade and could raise Diamond Offshore’s cost of financing. Consequently, Diamond Offshore may not be able to issue additional debt in amounts and/or with terms that it considers to be reasonable. These ratings could limit Diamond Offshore’s ability to pursue other business opportunities or to refinance its indebtedness as it matures.  

Diamond Offshore’s revolving credit facilities bear interest at variable rates, based on its corporate credit rating and market interest rates. If market interest rates increase, Diamond Offshore’s cost to borrow under its revolving credit facilities may also increase. Although Diamond Offshore may employ hedging strategies such that a portion of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under this credit facilities would effectively carry a fixed rate of interest, any hedging arrangement put in place may not offer complete protection from this risk.  

Diamond Offshore’s consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another.  

Diamond Offshore’s consolidated effective income tax rate is impacted by the mix between its domestic and international 

pre-tax  earnings or losses, as well as the mix of the international tax jurisdictions in which it operates. Diamond Offshore cannot provide any assurance as to what its consolidated effective income tax rate will be in the future due to, among other factors, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of its business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as potential changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts Diamond Offshore has provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated financial statements. This variability may cause its consolidated effective income tax rate to vary substantially from one reporting period to another. 

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expense includes fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.  

Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of its drilling equipment, which is often not affected by changes in dayrates and utilization. During periods of reduced revenue and/or activity (like the current protracted industry downturn), certain of Diamond Offshore’s fixed costs will not decline and often it may incur additional operating costs, such as fuel and catering   

26 

Table of Contents  

costs, for which the customer generally reimburses Diamond Offshore when a rig is under contract. During times of reduced dayrates and utilization, like the current protracted industry downturn, reductions in costs may not be immediate as Diamond Offshore may incur additional costs associated with cold stacking a rig (particularly if Diamond Offshore cold stacks a newer rig, such as a drillship or other DP semisubmersible rig, for which cold stacking costs are typically substantially higher than for an older 

non-DP rig), or it may not be able to fully reduce the cost of its support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenue due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in contract drilling expense. 

Contracts for Diamond Offshore’s drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in Diamond Offshore’s operating costs could adversely affect the profitability of those contracts.  

Diamond Offshore’s contracts for its drilling rigs generally provide for the payment of an agreed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs it incurs on the project. Over the term of a drilling contract, Diamond Offshore’s operating costs may fluctuate due to events beyond its control. In addition, equipment repair and maintenance expenses vary depending on the type of activity the rig is performing, the age and condition of the equipment and general market factors impacting relevant parts, components and services. The gross margin that Diamond Offshore realizes on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in its operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, Diamond Offshore may not be able to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from its customers.  

Diamond Offshore is subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit its business activities and revenues and increase its costs.  

Certain countries are subject to restrictions, sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government or other governmental or international authorities. These restrictions, sanctions and embargoes may prohibit or limit Diamond Offshore from participating in certain business activities in those countries. Diamond Offshore’s operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent, and may in some cases impose “strict liability,” rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject Diamond Offshore to civil or criminal enforcement action, for which it may not receive contractual indemnification or have insurance coverage, and could result in the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all of Diamond Offshore’s activities in the affected areas. Diamond Offshore may be required to make significant expenditures for additional capital equipment or inspections and recertifications to comply with existing or new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may, in the future, add significantly to Diamond Offshore’s operating costs or result in a substantial reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment, or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.  

In addition, these laws and regulations require Diamond Offshore to perform certain regulatory inspections, which it refers to as a special survey. For most of Diamond Offshore’s rigs, these special surveys are due every five years, although the inspection interval for its North Sea rigs is two and one half years. Diamond Offshore’s operations are negatively impacted during these special surveys. These special surveys are generally performed in a shipyard and require scheduled downtime, which can negatively impact operating revenue. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard and inspection, repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a special survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. Diamond Offshore’s business may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim periods between special surveys. Although an intermediate survey normally does not require shipyard time, the survey may require some downtime for the rig. Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime and/or the costs or lost revenues associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.

In addition, the offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, can be affected by changes in tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. Governments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could limit drilling opportunities.  

Diamond Offshore’s business involves numerous operating hazards which could expose it to significant losses and significant damage claims. Diamond Offshore is not fully insured against all of these risks and its contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect Diamond Offshore.  

Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel and damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to marine hazards, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. Any of the foregoing events could result in significant damage or loss to Diamond Offshore’s properties and assets or the properties and assets of others, injury or death to rig personnel or others, significant loss of revenues and significant damage claims against Diamond Offshore.  

Diamond Offshore’s drilling contracts with its customers provide for varying levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities between its customers and Diamond Offshore with respect to the hazards and risks inherent in, and damages or losses arising out of, its operations, and Diamond Offshore may not be fully protected. Diamond Offshore’s contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated.  

Additionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in Diamond Offshore’s contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or such provisions may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and Diamond Offshore could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions in Diamond Offshore’s contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is unsettled under certain laws that are applicable to Diamond Offshore’s contracts. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore’s contracts with its customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect it against all hazards and risks inherent in its operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify Diamond Offshore will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.  

Diamond Offshore maintains liability insurance, which generally includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage may not adequately cover its losses and claim costs. In addition, certain risks and contingencies related to pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable. Also, Diamond Offshore does not typically purchase 

loss-of-hire insurance to cover lost revenues when a rig is unable to work. There can be no assurance that Diamond Offshore will continue to carry the insurance it currently maintains, that its insurance will cover all types of losses or that it will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates it considers to be reasonable or that Diamond Offshore will be able to obtain insurance against some risks. 

If an accident or other event occurs that exceeds Diamond Offshore’s insurance coverage limits or is not an insurable event under its insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could result in significant loss to Diamond Offshore.

Significant portions of Diamond Offshore’s operations are conducted outside the United States and involve additional risks not associated with United States domestic operations.  

Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 47%, 41% and 58% of its total consolidated revenues for 2019, 2018 and 2017 and include, or have included, operations in South America, Australia and Southeast Asia, Europe and Mexico. Because Diamond Offshore operates in various regions throughout the world, it is exposed to a variety of risks inherent in international operations, including risks of war or conflicts, political and economic instability and disruption, civil disturbance, acts of piracy, terrorism or other assaults on property or personnel, corruption, possible economic and legal sanctions (such as possible restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may consider to be state sponsors of terrorism), changes in global monetary and trade policies, laws and regulations, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, restrictions on currency exchange, controls over the repatriation of income or capital and other risks. Diamond Offshore may not have insurance coverage for these risks, or it may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for such events at reasonable rates. Diamond Offshore’s operations may become restricted, disrupted or prohibited in any country in which any of these risks occur.  

In 2016, the U.K. approved an exit from the E.U., commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially left the E.U., on January 31, 2020. Following its departure, the U.K. entered into a transition period that is scheduled to last until December 31, 2020 during which period of time the U.K.’s trading relationship with the E.U. is expected to remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a trade agreement as well as other aspects of the U.K.’s relationship with the E.U. The impact of Brexit and the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. are uncertain for companies that do business in the U.K. and the overall global economy. Approximately 17% of Diamond Offshore’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 were generated in the U.K. Brexit, or similar events in other jurisdictions, could depress economic activity or impact global markets, including foreign exchange and securities markets, which may have an adverse impact on Diamond Offshore’s business as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, tariffs, treaties and other regulatory matters.  

Diamond Offshore is also subject to the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing its international operations in addition to domestic and international anti-bribery laws and sanctions, trade laws and regulations, customs laws and regulations and other restrictions imposed by other governmental or international authorities. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which Diamond Offshore operates, including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling rigs, import-export quotas or other trade barriers, repatriation of foreign earnings or capital, oil and gas exploration and development, local content requirements, taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel and use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.  

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Boardwalk Pipelines  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ natural gas transportation and storage operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including rules and regulations related to the rates it can charge for its services and its ability to construct or abandon facilities. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be able to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines, including earning a reasonable return.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ natural gas transportation and storage

 operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FERC, including the types, rates and terms of services Boardwalk Pipelines may offer to its customers, construction of new facilities, creation, modification or abandonment of services or facilities and recordkeeping and relationships with affiliated companies. An adverse FERC action in any of these areas could affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to compete for business, construct new facilities, offer new services or recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. This regulatory oversight can result in longer lead times to develop and complete any future project than competitors that are not subject to the FERC’s regulations. The FERC can also deny Boardwalk Pipelines the right to abandon certain facilities from service.  

29 

Table of Contents 

The FERC also regulates the rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge for its natural gas transportation and storage operations. For cost-based services, the FERC establishes both the maximum and minimum rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge. The basic elements that the FERC considers are the costs of providing service, the volumes of gas being transported, the rate design, the allocation of costs between services, the capital structure and the rate of return a pipeline is permitted to earn. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be able to recover all its costs, including certain costs associated with pipeline integrity, through existing or future rates.  

The FERC and/or Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers could challenge the maximum applicable rates that any of its regulated pipelines are allowed to charge in accordance with Section 5 of the NGA. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Revised Policy Statement that was issued by the FERC in 2018 may increase the likelihood of such a challenge. Pending legislation that would amend Section 5 of the NGA to add refund provisions could increase the likelihood of such a challenge. If such a challenge is successful for any of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines, the revenues associated with transportation and storage services the pipeline provides pursuant to 

cost-of-service rates could materially decrease in the future, which would adversely affect the revenues on that pipeline going forward. 

Legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to pipeline safety that require the use of new or more prescriptive compliance activities, substantial changes to existing integrity management programs or withdrawal of regulatory waivers could subject Boardwalk Pipelines to increased capital and operating costs and operational delays.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA, which is part of the DOT. PHMSA regulates the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, and maintenance of existing interstate natural gas and NGLs pipeline facilities. PHMSA regulation currently requires pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including frequent inspections, correction of certain identified anomalies and other measures to promote pipeline safety in HCAs, MCAs, Class 3 and 4 areas, as well as areas unusually sensitive to environmental damage and commercially navigable waterways. States have jurisdiction over certain of Boardwalk Pipelines’ intrastate pipelines and have adopted regulations similar to existing PHMSA regulations. State regulations may impose more stringent requirements than found under federal law that affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ intrastate operations. Compliance with these rules over time generally has resulted in an overall increase in maintenance costs. The imposition of new or more stringent pipeline safety rules applicable to natural gas or NGL pipelines, or any issuance or reinterpretation of guidance from PHMSA or any state agencies with respect thereto could cause Boardwalk Pipelines to install new or modified safety controls, pursue additional capital projects or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in Boardwalk Pipelines incurring increased capital and operating costs, experiencing operational delays and suffering potential adverse impacts to its operations or ability to reliably serve its customers. Requirements that are imposed under the 2011 Act or the more recent 2016 Act may also increase Boardwalk Pipelines’ capital and operating costs or impact the operation of its pipelines. For example, in 2016, PHMSA published a proposed rulemaking that would impose new or more stringent requirements for certain natural gas pipelines including, among other things, expanding certain of PHMSA’s current regulatory safety programs for natural gas lines in newly defined MCAs that do not qualify as HCAs and requiring MAOP validation through 

re-verification of all historical records for pipelines in service, which may require natural gas pipelines installed before 1970 (previously excluded from certain pressure testing obligations) to be pressure tested. New pipeline safety legislation is expected to be proposed and finalized in 2020 that will reauthorize PHMSA pipeline safety programs, which under the 2016 Act expired at the end of September of 2019. Any such new pipeline safety legislation or implementing regulations could impose more stringent or costly compliance obligations on Boardwalk Pipelines and could require it to pursue additional capital projects or conduct integrity or maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, any or all of which tasks could result in Boardwalk Pipelines incurring increased operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on its costs of providing transportation services. 

Boardwalk Pipelines has entered into certain firm transportation contracts with shippers on certain of its expansion projects that utilize the design capacity of certain of its pipeline assets, based upon the authority Boardwalk Pipelines received from PHMSA to operate those pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipeline’s SMYS under issued permits with specific conditions. PHMSA retains discretion to withdraw or modify this authority. If PHMSA were to withdraw or materially modify such authority, it could affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to transport all of its contracted quantities of natural gas on these pipeline assets and it could incur significant additional costs to reinstate this authority or to develop alternate ways to meet its contractual obligations.

Boardwalk Pipelines’ actual construction and development costs could exceed its forecasts, its anticipated cash flow from construction and development projects will not be immediate and its construction and development projects may not be completed on time or at all.  

Boardwalk Pipelines has been and is currently engaged in several construction projects involving its existing assets and the construction of new facilities for which it has expended or will expend significant capital. Boardwalk Pipelines expects to continue to engage in the construction of additional growth projects and modifications of its system. When Boardwalk Pipelines builds a new pipeline or expands or modifies an existing facility, the design, construction and development occurs over an extended period of time, and it will not receive any revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed into commercial service. On Boardwalk Pipelines’ interstate pipelines there are several years between when the project is announced and when customers begin using the new facilities. During this period, Boardwalk Pipelines spends capital and incurs costs without receiving any of the financial benefits associated with the projects. The construction of new assets involves regulatory (federal, state and local), landowner opposition, environmental, activist, legal, political, materials and labor costs, as well as operational and other risks that are difficult to predict and some are beyond Boardwalk Pipelines’ control. A project may not be completed on time or at all due to a variety of factors, may be impacted by significant cost overruns or may be materially changed prior to completion as a result of developments or circumstances that Boardwalk Pipelines is not aware of when it commits to the project. Any of these events could result in material unexpected costs or have a material adverse effect on Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to realize the anticipated benefits from its growth projects.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ and its customers’ operations are subject to a series of risks arising out of the threat of climate change that could result in increased operating costs, limit the areas in which fossil fuels are produced and reduce demand for the services Boardwalk Pipelines provides.  

The threat of climate change continues to attract considerable attention in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Numerous proposals have been made and could continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit existing emissions of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) as well as to restrict or eliminate such future emissions, which makes Boardwalk Pipelines operations as well as the operations of its fossil fuel producer customers subject to a series of regulatory, political, litigation and financial risks associated with the production and processing of fossil fuels and emission of GHGs.  

In the U.S., no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level. With the U.S. Supreme Court finding that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the Environmental Protection Agency has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain natural gas system sources in the U.S., implement New Source Performance Standards directing the reduction of methane from certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the natural gas sector, and together with the DOT, implement GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the U.S. Various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs and restriction of emissions. At the international level, the 

non-binding Paris Agreement requests that nations limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, although the U.S. has announced its withdrawal from such agreement, effective November 4, 2020. 

Governmental, scientific and public concern over the threat of climate change arising from GHG emissions has resulted in increasing political risks in the U.S., including climate change related pledges made by certain candidates seeking the presidential office in 2020. Declarations made by one or more candidates running for the Democratic nomination for president include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of crude oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. A new presidential administration could also pursue the imposition of more restrictive requirements for the establishment of pipeline infrastructure or the permitting of LNG export facilities, as well as the reversal of the U.S.’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against fossil fuel producer companies in state or federal court, alleging, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.   

31 

Table of Contents  

There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel energy companies as investors in fossil fuel energy companies become increasingly concerned about the potential effects of climate change and may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into 

non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. This could make it more difficult for Boardwalk Pipelines to secure funding for exploration and production or midstream energy business activities. 

The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce fossil fuels or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for fossil fuels, which could reduce demand for Boardwalk Pipelines transportation and storage services. Political, litigation and financial risks may result in its fossil fuel producer customers restricting or canceling production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climatic changes or impairing their ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for Boardwalk Pipelines’ services.  

The price differentials between natural gas supplies and market demand for natural gas have reduced the transportation rates that Boardwalk Pipelines can charge on certain portions of its pipeline systems.  

Each year a portion of Boardwalk Pipelines firm natural gas transportation contracts expire and need to be replaced or renewed. Over the past several years, as a result of market conditions, Boardwalk Pipelines has renewed some expiring contracts at lower rates or for shorter terms than in the past. The transportation rates Boardwalk Pipelines is able to charge customers are heavily influenced by market trends (both short and longer term), including the available supply, geographical location of natural gas production, the competition between producing basins, competition with other pipelines for supply and markets, the demand for gas by 

end-users such as power plants, petrochemical facilities and LNG export facilities and the price differentials between the gas supplies and the market demand for the gas (basis differentials). Market conditions have resulted in a sustained narrowing of basis differentials on certain portions of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipeline system, which has reduced transportation rates that can be charged in the affected areas and adversely affected the contract terms Boardwalk Pipelines can secure from its customers for available transportation capacity and for contracts being renewed or replaced. The prevailing market conditions may also lead some of its customers to seek to renegotiate existing contracts to terms that are less attractive to Boardwalk Pipelines; for example, seeking a current price reduction in exchange for an extension of the contract term. Boardwalk Pipelines expects these market conditions to continue. 

Boardwalk Pipelines is exposed to credit risk relating to default or bankruptcy by its customers.  

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss resulting from the default by a customer of its contractual obligations or the customer filing bankruptcy. Boardwalk Pipelines has credit risk with both its existing customers and those supporting its growth projects.  

Credit risk exists in relation to Boardwalk Pipelines’ growth projects, both because foundation customers make long term firm capacity commitments to Boardwalk Pipelines for such projects and certain of those foundation customers agree to provide credit support as construction for such projects progresses. If a customer fails to post the required credit support during the growth project process, overall returns on the project may be reduced to the extent an adjustment to the scope of the project results or Boardwalk Pipelines is unable to replace the defaulting customer. Boardwalk Pipelines recently had a customer declare bankruptcy for which it was able to use the credit support to cover a portion of the customer’s remaining long term commitment.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ credit exposure also includes receivables for services provided, future performance under firm agreements and volumes of gas owed by customers for imbalances or gas loaned by Boardwalk Pipelines to them under certain NNS and parking and lending (“PAL”) services.

Changes in energy prices, including natural gas, oil and NGLs, impact the supply of and demand for those commodities, which impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ business.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers, especially producers, are directly impacted by changes in commodity prices. The prices of natural gas, oil and NGLs fluctuate in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors, including for natural gas the realization of potential LNG exports and demand growth within the power generation market. The declines in the levels of natural gas, oil and NGLs prices experienced in recent history have adversely affected the businesses of Boardwalk Pipelines’ producer customers and reduced the demand for Boardwalk Pipelines’ services and could result in defaults or the 

non-renewal of Boardwalk Pipelines’ contracted capacity when existing contracts expire. Future increases in the price of natural gas and NGLs could make alternative energy and feedstock sources more competitive and reduce demand for natural gas and NGLs. A reduced level of demand for natural gas and NGLs could reduce the utilization of capacity on Boardwalk Pipelines’ systems and reduce the demand of its services. 

Boardwalk Pipelines’ substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.  

Boardwalk Pipelines has a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Boardwalk Pipelines’ inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Boardwalk Pipelines’ substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:  

   • 

limit Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other general business activities;   

   • 

increase Boardwalk Pipelines’ vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and   

   • 

limit Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.   

In addition, the credit agreements governing Boardwalk Pipelines’ current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial or other restrictive covenants, which impose significant operating and financial restrictions. As a result of these covenants, Boardwalk Pipelines could be limited in the manner in which it conducts its business and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance its future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on its business.  

Boardwalk Pipelines will be permitted, under its revolving credit facility and the indentures governing its notes, to incur additional debt, subject to certain limitations under its revolving credit facility and, in the case of unsecured debt, under the indentures governing the notes. If Boardwalk Pipelines incurs additional debt, its increased leverage could also result in the consequences described above.  

Limited access to the debt markets and increases in interest rates could adversely affect Boardwalk Pipelines’ business.  

Boardwalk Pipelines anticipates funding its capital spending requirements through its available financing options, including cash generated from operations and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Changes in the debt markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and an increase in interest rates, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. This may affect its ability to raise needed funding and reduce the amount of cash available to fund its operations or growth projects. If the debt markets were not available, it is not certain if other adequate financing options would be available to Boardwalk Pipelines on terms and conditions that it would find acceptable.   

33 

Table of Contents 

Any disruption in the debt markets could require Boardwalk Pipelines to take additional measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until it can arrange alternative credit arrangements or other funding for its business needs. Such measures could include reducing or delaying business activities, reducing its operations to lower expenses and reducing other discretionary uses of cash. Boardwalk Pipelines may be unable to execute its growth strategy or take advantage of certain business opportunities.  

Boardwalk Pipelines does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to its operations.  

Boardwalk Pipelines does not own all of the land on which its pipelines and facilities have been constructed, and Boardwalk Pipeline is subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and/or increased costs to retain necessary land use if it does not have valid 

rights-of-way or if such 

rights-of-way lapse or terminate. Boardwalk Pipelines obtains the rights to construct and operate its pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a specific period of time. Boardwalk Pipelines cannot guarantee that it will always be able to renew, when necessary, existing 

rights-of-way or obtain new 

rights-of-way without experiencing significant costs or experiencing landowner opposition. Any loss of these land use rights with respect to the operation of Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines and facilities, through its inability to renew 

right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on its business. 

Rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion could damage Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines and the facilities that serve its customers, particularly along coastal waters and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, which could adversely affect its operations and financial condition.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipeline operations along coastal waters and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico could be impacted by rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion. Subsidence issues are also a concern for Boardwalk Pipelines’ pipelines at major river crossings. Rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion could cause serious damage to its pipelines, which could affect its ability to provide transportation services or result in leakage, migration, releases or spills from its operations to surface or subsurface soils, surface water, groundwater or offshore waters, which could result in liability, remedial obligations and/or otherwise have a negative impact on continued operations. Such rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion processes could impact Boardwalk Pipelines’ customers who operate along coastal waters or offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, and they may be unable to utilize Boardwalk Pipelines services. Rising sea levels, subsidence and erosion could also expose Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations to increased risks associated with severe weather conditions and other adverse events and conditions, such as hurricanes and flooding. As a result, Boardwalk Pipelines may incur significant costs to repair and preserve its pipeline infrastructure. Such costs could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In recent years, local governments and landowners have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against energy companies, alleging that their operations contributed to increased coastal rising seas and erosion and seeking substantial damages.  

Boardwalk Pipelines may not be successful in executing its strategy to grow and diversify its business.  

Boardwalk Pipelines relies primarily on the revenues generated from its natural gas transportation and storage services. Negative developments in these services have significantly greater impact on Boardwalk Pipelines’ financial condition and results of operations than if it maintained more diverse assets. Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to grow, diversify and increase cash flows will depend, in part, on its ability to expand its existing business lines and to close and execute on accretive acquisitions. Boardwalk Pipelines may not be successful in acquiring or developing such assets or may do so on terms that ultimately are not profitable. Any such transactions involve potential risks that may include, among other things:  

   • 

the diversion of management’s and employees’ attention from other business concerns;   

   • 

inaccurate assumptions about volume, revenues and project costs, including potential synergies;   

   • 

a decrease in Boardwalk Pipelines’ liquidity as a result of using available cash or borrowing capacity to finance the acquisition or project;   

34 

Table of Contents 

   • 

a significant increase in interest expense or financial leverage if it incurs additional debt to finance the acquisition or project;   

   • 

inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of debt;   

   • 

an inability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate the acquired business and assets or the developed assets;   

   • 

unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and   

   • 

changes in regulatory requirements or delays of regulatory approvals.   

Additionally, acquisitions also contain the following risks:  

   • 

an inability to integrate successfully the businesses Boardwalk Pipelines acquires;   

   • 

the assumption of unknown liabilities for which it is not indemnified, for which its indemnity is inadequate or for which its insurance policies may exclude from coverage;   

   • 

limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller; and   

   • 

customer or key employee losses of an acquired business.   

Boardwalk Pipelines’ ability to replace expiring gas storage contracts at attractive rates or on a long-term basis and to sell short-term services at attractive rates or at all are subject to market conditions.  

Boardwalk Pipelines owns and operates substantial natural gas storage facilities. The market for the storage and PAL services that it offers is impacted by the factors and market conditions discussed above for Boardwalk Pipelines’ transportation services, and is also impacted by natural gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads), and the volatility in time period price spreads. When market conditions cause a narrowing of time period price spreads and a decline in the price volatility of natural gas, these factors adversely impact the rates Boardwalk Pipelines can charge for its storage and PAL services.  

Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations are subject to catastrophic losses, operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which it may not be adequately insured.  

There are a variety of operating risks inherent in transporting and storing natural gas, ethylene and NGLs, such as leaks and other forms of releases, explosions, fires, cyber-attacks and mechanical problems, which could have catastrophic consequences. Additionally, the nature and location of Boardwalk Pipelines’ business may make it susceptible to catastrophic losses from hurricanes or other named storms, particularly with regard to its assets in the Gulf Coast region, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, and other severe weather. Any of these or other similar occurrences could result in the disruption of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operations, substantial repair costs, personal injury or loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of its operations and substantial financial losses. The location of pipelines in HCAs, which includes populated areas, residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could significantly increase the level of damages resulting from some of these risks.  

Boardwalk Pipelines currently possesses property, business interruption, cyber threat and general liability insurance, but proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Boardwalk Pipelines does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain events, hazards or all potential losses.

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Loews Hotels & Co  

Loews Hotels & Co’s business may be adversely affected by various operating risks common to the hospitality industry, including competition, excess supply and dependence on business travel and tourism.  

Loews Hotels & Co owns and operates hotels which have different economic characteristics than many other real estate assets. A typical office property, for example, has long-term leases with third-party tenants, which provide a relatively stable long-term stream of revenue. Hotels, on the other hand, generate revenue from guests that typically stay at the hotel for only a few nights, which causes the room rate and occupancy levels at each hotel to change every day, and results in earnings that can be highly volatile.  

In addition, Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are subject to various operating risks common to the hospitality industry, many of which are beyond Loews Hotels & Co’s control, including:  

   • 

changes in general economic conditions, including the severity and duration of any downturn in the U.S. or global economy and financial markets;   

   • 

war, political conditions or civil unrest, terrorist activities or threats and heightened travel security measures instituted in response to these events;   

   • 

outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases, such as the recent coronavirus;   

   • 

natural or man-made disasters;   

   • 

any material reduction or prolonged interruption of public utilities and services;   

   • 

decreased corporate or government travel-related budgets and spending and cancellations, deferrals or renegotiations of group business due to adverse economic conditions or otherwise;   

   • 

decreased need for business-related travel due to innovations in business-related technology;   

   • 

competition from other hotels and alternative accommodations, such as Airbnb, in the markets in which Loews Hotels & Co operates;   

   • 

requirements for periodic capital reinvestment to maintain and upgrade hotels;   

   • 

increases in operating costs, including labor (such as from minimum wage increases), workers’ compensation, benefits, insurance, food and beverage, commodity costs, energy and unanticipated costs resulting from force majeure events, due to inflation, new or different federal, state or local governmental regulations, including tariffs, and other factors that may not be offset by increased revenues;   

   • 

the costs and administrative burdens associated with compliance with applicable laws and regulations;   

   • 

organized labor activities, which could cause a diversion of business from hotels involved in labor negotiations and loss of business for Loews Hotels & Co’s properties generally as a result of certain labor tactics;   

   • 

changes in the desirability of particular locations or travel patterns of customers, including with respect to the underlying attractions supporting Loews Hotels & Co’s existing and under development immersive destination properties, such as the Universal theme park for its Orlando, Florida properties, the stadiums in Arlington, Texas and St. Louis, Missouri for its Live! by Loews hotels and convention centers for properties in other markets;   

   • 

geographic concentration of operations and customers;   

   • 

shortages of desirable locations for development; and   

36 

Table of Contents  

 • 

relationships with third-party property owners, developers, landlords and joint venture partners, including the risk that owners and/or partners may terminate management or joint venture agreements.   

These factors, and the reputational repercussions of these factors, could adversely affect, and from time to time have adversely affected, individual hotels and hotels in particular regions.  

Loews Hotels & Co is exposed to the risks resulting from significant investments in owned and leased real estate, which could increase its costs, reduce its profits, limit its ability to respond to market conditions or restrict its growth strategy.  

Loews Hotels & Co’s proportion of owned and leased properties, compared to the number of properties that it manages for third-party owners, is larger than that of some of its competitors. Real estate ownership and leasing is subject to risks not applicable to managed or franchised properties, including:  

   • 

real estate, insurance, zoning, tax, environmental and eminent domain laws;   

   • 

the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures to maintain or upgrade properties;   

   • 

risks associated with mortgage debt, including the possibility of default, fluctuating interest rate levels and the availability of replacement financing;   

   • 

risks associated with the possibility that cost increases will outpace revenue increases and that, in the event of an economic slowdown, a high proportion of fixed costs will make it difficult to reduce costs to the extent required to offset declining revenues;   

   • 

risks associated with real estate leases, including the possibility of rent increases and the inability to renew or extend upon favorable terms;   

   • 

risks associated with real estate condominiums, including the possibility of special assessments by condominiums Loews Hotels & Co does not control;   

   • 

fluctuations in real estate values and potential impairments in the value of Loews Hotels & Co’s assets; and   

   • 

the relative illiquidity of real estate compared to some other assets.   

The hospitality industry is subject to seasonal and cyclical volatility.  

The hospitality industry is seasonal in nature. The periods during which Loews Hotels & Co’s properties experience higher revenues vary from property to property, depending principally upon location and the consumer base served. Loews Hotels & Co generally expects revenues and earnings to be lower in the third quarter of each year than in each of the other quarters. In addition, the hospitality industry is cyclical and demand generally follows the general economy on a lagged basis. The seasonality and cyclicality of its industry may contribute to fluctuation in Loews Hotels & Co’s results of operations and financial condition.  

Loews Hotels & Co operates in a highly competitive industry, both for customers and for acquisitions and developments of new properties.  

The hospitality industry is highly competitive. Loews Hotels & Co’s properties compete with other hotels and alternative accommodations based on a number of factors, including room rates, quality of accommodations, service levels and amenities, location, brand affiliation, reputation and reservation systems. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Some of its competitors also have greater financial and marketing resources than Loews Hotels & Co. In addition, travelers can book stays on websites that facilitate the short-term rental of homes and apartments from owners, thereby providing an alternative to hotel rooms.   

37 

Table of Contents 

Loews Hotels & Co also competes for hotel acquisitions and development projects with entities that have similar investment objectives as it does. This competition could limit the number of suitable investment opportunities. It may also increase the bargaining power of Loews Hotels & Co’s counterparties, making it more difficult for Loews Hotels & Co to acquire or develop new properties on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in its business plan.  

Any deterioration in the quality or reputation of Loews Hotels & Co’s brands could have an adverse effect on its reputation and business.  

Loews Hotels & Co’s brands and its reputation are among its most important assets. Its ability to attract and retain guests depends, in part, on the public recognition of its brands and their associated reputation. If its brands become obsolete or consumers view them as unfashionable or lacking in consistency and quality, or its brands or reputation are otherwise harmed, Loews Hotels & Co may be unable to attract guests to its properties, and may further be unable to attract or retain joint venture partners or hotel owners. Loews Hotels & Co’s reputation may also suffer as a result of negative publicity regarding its hotels, including as a result of social media reports, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity. The continued expansion of media and social media formats has compounded the potential scope of negative publicity and has made it more difficult to control and effectively manage negative publicity.  

Loews Hotels & Co’s efforts to develop new properties and renovate existing properties could be delayed or become more expensive.  

Loews Hotels & Co from time to time renovates its properties and is currently expanding its portfolio through the 

ground-up  construction of a number of new developments, including new properties in Orlando, Florida, Kansas City, Missouri, St. Louis, Missouri and Coral Gables, Florida and in the future may similarly develop additional new properties. Often these projects are undertaken with joint venture partners who may also serve as developer. These efforts are subject to a number of risks, including: 

   • 

construction delays or cost overruns (including labor and materials or unforeseeable site conditions) that may increase project costs; cause new development projects to not be completed by lender imposed required completion dates or subject Loews Hotels & Co to cancellation penalties for reservations accepted;   

   • 

obtaining zoning, occupancy and other required permits or authorizations;   

   • 

changes in economic conditions that may result in weakened or lack of demand or negative project returns;   

   • 

governmental restrictions on the size or kind of development;   

   • 

projects financed with construction debt are subject to interest rate risk as uncertain timing and amount of draws make effective hedging difficult to obtain;   

   • 

force majeure events, including earthquakes, tornados, hurricanes or floods; and   

   • 

design defects that could increase costs.   

Additionally, developing new properties typically involves lengthy development periods during which significant amounts of capital must be funded before the properties begin to operate and generate revenue. If the cost of funding new development exceeds budgeted amounts, and/or the time period for development is longer than initially anticipated, Loews Hotels & Co’s profits could be reduced. Further, due to the lengthy development cycle, intervening adverse economic conditions in general and as they apply to Loews Hotels & Co and its development partners may alter or impede the development plans, thereby resulting in incremental costs or potential impairment charges. In addition, using multiple sources of capital to develop new properties reduces or eliminates the ability of Loews Hotels & Co to cease commenced projects if the overall economic environment conditions change. Moreover, during the early stages of operations, charges related to interest expense and depreciation may substantially detract from, or even outweigh, the profitability of certain new property investments.   

38 

Table of Contents 

Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are geographically concentrated, which exposes its business to the effects of regional events and occurrences.  

Loews Hotels & Co has a concentration of hotels in Florida. Specifically, as of December 31, 2019, seven hotels, representing 50% of rooms in its system, were located at Universal Orlando in Orlando, Florida and eight hotels, representing approximately 56% of rooms in its system, were located in Florida. The concentration of hotels in one region or a limited number of markets may expose Loews Hotels & Co to risks of adverse economic and other developments that are greater than if its portfolio were more geographically diverse. These developments include regional economic downturns, a decline in the popularity of or access to area tourist attractions, such as theme parks, significant increases in the number of Loews Hotels & Co’s competitors’ hotels in these markets and potentially higher local property, sales and income taxes in the geographic markets in which it is concentrated. In addition, Loews Hotels & Co’s properties in Florida are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as hurricanes, strong winds and flooding, which have in the past caused damage to its hotels in Florida, and which may in the future be intensified as a result of climate change, as well as outbreaks of pandemic or contagious diseases.  

The growth and use of alternative reservation channels adversely affects Loews Hotels & Co’s business.  

A significant percentage of hotel rooms for guests at Loews Hotels & Co’s properties is booked through internet travel and other intermediaries. In most cases, Loews Hotels & Co has agreements with such intermediaries and pays them commissions and/or fees for sales of its rooms through their systems. If such bookings increase, these intermediaries may be able to obtain higher commissions or fees, reduced room rates or other significant concessions from Loews Hotels & Co. There can be no assurance that Loews Hotels & Co will be able to negotiate such agreements in the future with terms as favorable as those that exist today. Moreover, these intermediaries generally employ aggressive marketing strategies, including expending significant resources for online and television advertising campaigns to drive consumers to their websites and other outlets. As a result, consumers may develop brand loyalties to the intermediaries’ offered brands, websites and reservations systems rather than to Loews Hotels & Co’s brands.  

Under certain circumstances, Loews Hotels & Co’s insurance coverage may not cover all possible losses, and it may not be able to renew its insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all.  

Although Loews Hotels & Co maintains various property, casualty and other insurance policies, proceeds from such insurance coverage may not be adequate for all liabilities or expenses incurred or revenues lost. Moreover, such insurance may not be available in the future at commercially reasonable costs and terms. The insurance coverage Loews Hotels & Co does obtain may contain large deductibles or fail to cover certain events, hazards or all potential losses.  

Labor shortages could restrict Loews Hotels & Co’s ability to operate its properties or grow its business or result in increased labor costs that could reduce its profits.  

Loews Hotels & Co’s properties are staffed 24 hours a day, seven days a week by thousands of employees. If it is unable to attract, retain, train and engage skilled employees, its ability to manage and staff its properties adequately could be impaired, which could reduce customer satisfaction. Staffing shortages could also hinder its ability to grow and expand its business. Because payroll costs are a major component of the operating expenses at its properties, a shortage of skilled labor could also require higher wages that would increase its labor costs.  

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiary, Altium Packaging  

Altium Packaging’s substantial indebtedness could affect its ability to meet its obligations and may otherwise restrict its activities.  

Altium Packaging has a significant amount of indebtedness, which requires significant interest payments. Its inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy its debt obligations, or to refinance its obligations on commercially reasonable terms, would have a material adverse effect on its business. Altium Packaging’s substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:   

39 

Table of Contents 

   • 

limit its ability to borrow money for its working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other corporate purposes;   

   • 

increase its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and   

   • 

limit its ability to respond to business opportunities, including growing its business through acquisitions.   

In addition, the credit agreements governing its current indebtedness contain, and any future debt instruments would likely contain, financial and other restrictive covenants, which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on it. As a result of these covenants, Altium Packaging could be limited in the manner in which it conducts its business and may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. Furthermore, a failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on Altium Packaging.  

Fluctuations in raw material prices and raw material availability may affect Altium Packaging’s results.  

To produce its products, Altium Packaging uses large quantities of plastic resins and recycled plastic materials. It faces the risk that its access to these raw materials may be interrupted or that it may not be able to purchase these raw materials at prices that are acceptable to it. In general, Altium Packaging does not have long-term supply contracts with its suppliers, and its purchases of raw materials are subject to market price volatility. Although Altium Packaging generally is able to pass changes in the prices of raw materials through to its customers over a period of time, it may not always be able to do so or there may be a lag between when its costs increase and when it passes those costs through to its customers. It may not be able to pass through all future raw material price increases in a timely manner or at all due to competitive pressures. In addition, a sustained increase in resin and recycled plastic prices, relative to alternative packaging materials, would make plastic containers less economical for its customers and could result in reductions in the use of plastic containers. Any limitation on its ability to procure its primary raw materials or to pass through price increases in such materials on a timely basis could negatively affect Altium Packaging.  

Altium Packaging’s customers may increase their self-manufacturing.  

Increased self-manufacturing by Altium Packaging’s customers may have a material adverse impact on its sales volume and financial results. Altium Packaging believes that its customers may engage in self-manufacturing over time at locations where transportation costs are high, and where low complexity and available space to install blow molding equipment exist.  

Risks Related to Us and Our Subsidiaries Generally  

In addition to the specific risks and uncertainties faced by our subsidiaries, as discussed above, we and all of our subsidiaries face additional risks and uncertainties described below.  

Acts of terrorism could harm us and our subsidiaries.  

Terrorist attacks and the continued threat of terrorism in the United States or abroad, the continuation or escalation of existing armed hostilities or the outbreak of additional hostilities, including military and other action by the United States and its allies, could have a significant impact on us and the assets and businesses of our subsidiaries. CNA issues coverages that are exposed to risk of loss from an act of terrorism. Terrorist acts or the threat of terrorism could also result in increased political, economic and financial market instability, a decline in energy consumption and volatility in the price of oil and gas, which could affect the market for Diamond Offshore’s drilling services and Boardwalk Pipelines’ transportation and storage services. In addition, future terrorist attacks could lead to reductions in business travel and tourism which could harm Loews Hotels. While our subsidiaries take steps that they believe are appropriate to secure their assets, there is no assurance that they can completely secure them against a terrorist attack or obtain adequate insurance coverage for terrorist acts at reasonable rates.

Table of Contents 

Changes in tax laws, regulations or treaties, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in jurisdictions in which we or our subsidiaries operate could adversely impact us.  

Changes in federal, state or foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties applicable to us or our subsidiaries or changes in the interpretation or enforcement thereof could materially and adversely impact our and our subsidiaries’ tax liability, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including the amount of cash our subsidiaries have available to distribute to their shareholders, including us. Other potential tax law changes, including further modification of the federal corporate tax rate, the taxation of interest from municipal bonds (and thus the rate at which CNA discounts certain reserves) or foreign earnings could have such material adverse effects.  

Our subsidiaries face significant risks related to compliance with environmental laws.  

Our subsidiaries have extensive obligations and financial exposure related to compliance with federal, state, local, foreign and international environmental laws, including those relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal, removal or clean up of hazardous wastes and other activities relating to the protection of the environment. Many of such laws have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may in some cases impose strict liability, which could be substantial, rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. For example, Diamond Offshore could be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills related to its operations, including for conduct of or conditions caused by others. Boardwalk Pipelines is also subject to environmental laws and regulations, including requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities, restricting the manner in which it disposes of waste, requiring remedial action to remove or mitigate contamination resulting from a spill or other release and requiring capital expenditures to comply with pollution control requirements. In addition, Altium Packaging may be adversely affected by laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that increase the cost of producing, or otherwise adversely affect the demand for, plastic products. Further, existing environmental laws or the interpretation or enforcement thereof may be amended and new laws may be adopted in the future.  

Failures or interruptions in or breaches to our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems could materially and adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ operations.  

We and our subsidiaries are dependent upon information technologies, computer systems and networks, including those maintained by us and our subsidiaries and those maintained and provided to us and our subsidiaries by third parties (for example, 

“software-as-a-service” and cloud solutions), to conduct operations and are reliant on technology to help increase efficiency in our and their businesses. We and our subsidiaries are dependent upon operational and financial computer systems to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our and their businesses. Any failure of our or our subsidiaries’ computer systems, or those of our or their customers, vendors or others with whom we and they do business, could materially disrupt business operations. Computer, telecommunications and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes, including storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, fires, utility outages, theft, design defects, human error or complications encountered as existing systems are replaced or upgraded. In addition, it has been reported that unknown entities or groups have mounted 

so-called “cyber attacks” on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. In particular, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets may be specific targets of cyber attacks, which can have catastrophic consequences and there have also been reports that hotel chains, among other consumer-facing businesses, have been subject to various cyber attacks targeting payment card and other sensitive consumer information. Breaches of our and our subsidiaries’ computer security infrastructure can result from actions by our employees, vendors, third party administrators or by unknown third parties, and may disrupt our or their operations, cause significant damage to our or their assets and surrounding areas, cause loss of life or serious bodily injury and impact our or their data framework or cause a failure to protect personal information of customers or employees. 

The foregoing risks relating to disruption of service, interruption of operations and data loss could impact our and our subsidiaries’ ability to timely perform critical business functions, resulting in disruption or deterioration in our and our subsidiaries’ operations and business and expose us and our subsidiaries to monetary and reputational damages. In addition, potential exposures include substantially increased compliance costs and required computer system upgrades and security related investments. The breach of confidential information also could give rise to legal liability and regulatory action under data protection and privacy laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.

Some of our subsidiaries’ customer bases are concentrated.  

Some of our subsidiaries’ customer bases are concentrated. For instance, during 2019, two of Diamond Offshore’s customers in the Gulf of Mexico and Diamond Offshore’s three largest customers accounted for 50% and an aggregate of 69% of its annual total consolidated revenues. In addition, the number of customers that it has performed services for declined from 35 in 2014 to 12 in 2019. As of January 1, 2020, Diamond Offshore’s contracted backlog was an aggregate $1.6 billion of which 43%, 44% and 24% is attributable to its operations in the Gulf of Mexico for the years 2020, 2021 and 2022, from three customers. For Boardwalk Pipelines, for 2019, no customer comprised more than 10% or more of its operating revenues. However, as of December 31, 2019, the top ten customers holding future capacity on its pipelines under firm agreements comprised approximately 37% of its future revenues. Altium Packaging also depends on several large customers. The loss of or other problem with a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on these subsidiaries’ businesses and our financial results.  

Loss of key vendor relationships or issues relating to the transitioning of vendor relationships could result in a materially adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries’ operations.  

We and our subsidiaries rely on products, equipment and services provided by many third party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers in the United States and abroad, which exposes us and them to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. These include, for example, vendors of computer hardware, software and services, as well as other critical materials and services (including, in the case of CNA, claims administrators performing significant claims administration and adjudication functions). Certain products, equipment and services may be available from a limited number of sources. If one or more key vendors becomes unable to continue to provide products, equipment or services at the requisite level for any reason, or fails to protect our proprietary information, including in some cases personal information of employees, customers or hotel guests, we and our subsidiaries may experience a material adverse effect on our or their business, operations and reputation.  

We could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of the long-lived assets and goodwill of our subsidiaries.  

Our subsidiaries regularly evaluate their long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. Most notably, we could incur impairment charges related to the carrying value of offshore drilling equipment at Diamond Offshore, pipeline and storage assets at Boardwalk Pipelines and hotel properties owned by Loews Hotels.  

In particular, Diamond Offshore is currently experiencing declining demand for certain offshore drilling rigs as a result of depressed oil prices and excess rig supply and a protracted downturn in the industry. As a result, Diamond Offshore may incur additional asset impairments, rig retirements and/or rigs being scrapped.  

We also test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. Asset impairment evaluations by us and our subsidiaries with respect to both long-lived assets and goodwill are, by nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken.  

Changes in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect our or our subsidiaries’ operations.  

We and our subsidiaries are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”). It is possible that future accounting standards that we and our subsidiaries are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we and our subsidiaries apply to our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our and our subsidiaries’ results of operations and financial condition. For further information regarding changes in accounting standards that are currently pending and, if known, our estimates of their expected impact to the Company, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

We are a holding company and derive substantially all of our income and cash flow from our subsidiaries.  

We rely upon our invested cash balances and distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations and to declare and pay any dividends to holders of our common stock. Our subsidiaries are separate and independent legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to make funds available to us, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to, among other things, the availability of sufficient earnings and funds in such subsidiaries, applicable state laws, including in the case of the insurance subsidiaries of CNA, laws and rules governing the payment of dividends by regulated insurance companies, and their compliance with covenants in their respective loan agreements. Claims of creditors of our subsidiaries will generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and those of our creditors and shareholders.  

We and our subsidiaries face competition for senior executives and qualified specialized talent.  

We and our subsidiaries depend on the services of our key personnel, who possess skills critical to the operation of our and their businesses. Our and our subsidiaries’ executive management teams are highly experienced and possess extensive skills in their relevant industries. The ability to retain senior executives and to attract and retain highly skilled professionals and personnel with specialized industry and technical experience is important to our and our subsidiaries’ success and future growth. Competition for this talent can be intense, and we and our subsidiaries may not be successful in our efforts. The unexpected loss of the services of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us and our subsidiaries and could hinder our and their ability to effectively compete in the various industries in which we and they operate.  

From time to time we and our subsidiaries are subject to litigation, for which we and they may be unable to accurately assess the level of exposure and which if adversely determined, may have a significant adverse effect on our or their consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  

We and our subsidiaries are or may become parties to legal proceedings and disputes. These matters may include, among others, contract disputes, claims disputes, reinsurance disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, intellectual property disputes, disputes related to employment and tax matters and other litigation incidental to our or their businesses. Although our current assessment is that, other than as disclosed in this Report, there is no pending litigation that could have a significant adverse impact, it is difficult to predict the outcome or effect of any litigation matters and if our assessment proves to be in error, then the outcome of litigation could have a significant impact on our financial statements.  

We could have liability in the future for tobacco-related lawsuits.  

As a result of our ownership of Lorillard, Inc. (“Lorillard”) prior to the separation of Lorillard from us in 2008 (the “Separation”), from time to time we have been named as a defendant in tobacco-related lawsuits and could be named as a defendant in additional tobacco-related suits, notwithstanding the completion of the Separation. In the Separation Agreement entered into between us and Lorillard and its subsidiaries in connection with the Separation, Lorillard and each of its subsidiaries has agreed to indemnify us for liabilities related to Lorillard’s tobacco business, including liabilities that we may incur for current and future tobacco-related litigation against us. While we do not believe that we have any liability for tobacco-related claims, and we have never been held liable for any such claims, an adverse decision in a tobacco-related lawsuit against us could, if the indemnification is deemed for any reason to be unenforceable or any amounts owed to us thereunder are not collectible, in whole or in part, have a material adverse effect on us.
