ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Executive Overview 

We are focused on the ownership, management, redevelopment, and some development of quality apartment communities located in several of the largest markets in the United States. 

Our principal financial objective is to provide predictable and attractive returns to our equity holders. We measure our long-term total return using Economic Income, defined as NAV growth plus dividends. NAV is used by many investors because the value of company assets can be readily estimated, even for non-earning assets such as land or properties under development. NAV has the advantage of incorporating the investment decisions of thousands of real estate investors, enhancing comparability among companies that have differences in their accounting, avoiding disparity that can result from application of GAAP to investment properties and various ownership structures. Some investors focus on multiples of AFFO and Nareit FFO. Our disclosure of AFFO, a measure of current return, complements our focus on Economic Income. We also use Pro forma FFO as a secondary measure of operational performance. Over the last five years as of December 31, 2019, our Economic Income grew at a compounded annual return of 10%, comprised of a 6.9% compounded annual growth in NAV per share and $7.08 in cash dividends per share paid over the period. In 2019, AFFO per share grew $0.04, to $2.20 per share. 

Year-over-year as of December 31, 2019, our NAV per share increased by about 3.9%, which, with our cash dividend, provided Economic Income of 6.8%.  

Financial Highlights 

Net income attributable to common stockholders per common share, on a dilutive basis, decreased by $1.19 during the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower gains from dispositions. 

We sold our Asset Management business in July 2018, accepting near-term earnings dilution as the price of an increased long-term growth rate. In 2019, we overcame these earnings headwinds and Pro forma FFO per share increased by $0.05, or 2.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. For the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, the first comparative period without the Asset Management business, our Pro forma FFO and AFFO per share increased 5% and 12%, respectively. 

The year-over-year increase in Pro Forma FFO was due primarily to contribution from Same Store property net operating income growth of 4.3%, driven by a 3.8% increase in revenue, partially offset by a 2.4% increase in expenses. The increase in Same Store net operating income was offset partially by earnings dilution from the sale of the Asset Management business and lower tax benefit. AFFO per share also increased by $0.04, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the $0.05 increase in Pro forma FFO per share, partially offset by a $0.01 per share increase in capital replacement spending. 

Our business is organized around five areas of strategic focus: operational excellence; redevelopment and development; portfolio management; balance sheet; and team and culture. The results from the execution of our business plan in 2019 are further described in the sections that follow. 

Operational Excellence 

We own and operate a portfolio of apartment communities, diversified by both geography and price point. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included 124 apartment communities with 32,839 apartment homes in which we held an average ownership of approximately 99%, and approximately 80% of the value of our portfolio, measured by gross asset value (the estimated fair value of our communities), was attributable to Same Store communities. 

Our property operations team produced solid results for our portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2019. Same Store highlights include: 

•  

Average daily occupancy of 97.1%, 60 basis points higher than the year ended 2018; 

•  

Net operating income increased 4.3% with a 73.7% net operating income margin, 40 basis points higher than the margin for the year ended 2018; and 

•  

Rent increases on renewals and new leases averaged 4.9% and 1.9%, respectively, for a weighted-average increase of 3.4%, 40 basis points higher than the year ended 2018. 

Our focus on efficient operations through productivity initiatives such as centralization of administrative tasks, optimization of economies of scale at the corporate level, increased automation, and investment in more durable, longer-lived materials has

Table of Contents 

helped us control operating expenses. These and other innovations contributed to limiting growth in Same Store controllable operating expense, defined as property expenses less taxes, insurance, and utility expenses, compounding for the past 12 years at an annual rate of negative 0.2%. Our 2019 controllable operating expenses were flat compared to 2018. 

Redevelopment and Development 

Our second line of business is the redevelopment and some development of apartment communities. Through redevelopment activities, we expect to create value by repositioning communities within our portfolio. We undertake ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly or in connection with the redevelopment of an existing community. When warranted, we rely on the expertise and credit of a third-party developer familiar with the local market to limit our exposure to construction risk. Over the past five years, we have spent approximately $1.0 billion on redevelopment and development, targeting FCF internal rates of return of approximately 9% to 11% on these investments. 

We invest to earn risk-adjusted returns in excess of those expected from the apartment communities sold in paired trades to fund the redevelopment or development. Of these two activities, we generally favor redevelopment because it permits adjustment to the scope and timing of spending to align with changing market conditions and customer preferences. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested $229.8 million in redevelopment and development, an increase of approximately 30% compared to 2018. We continued redevelopment activities at Bay Parc and the ground-up construction at Parc Mosaic and The Fremont on the Anschutz Medical Campus. We also began the redevelopment of the North Tower at Flamingo Point and 707 Leahy, and ground-up construction at Eldridge Townhomes adjacent to our Elm Creek apartment community.  

The following table summarizes our significant redevelopment and development communities (dollars in millions): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

At 707 Leahy, we completed construction on the first building, containing 12 apartment homes, in January. Construction on the remaining homes is on schedule to be complete during the three months ending June 30, 2020. 

(2)  

At Flamingo Point, we completed construction on the entryway, retail, and amenities during the three months ended December 31, 2019, and continued the full renovation of the North Tower. 

(3)  

At Parc Mosaic, we completed three buildings in 2019, the first in August, the second in October, and the third in late December. As of December 31, 2019, the first two buildings were 81% leased and in January, we welcomed the first residents of the third building. The fourth, and final, building was delayed slightly and is now expected to be finished during the three months ending March 31, 2020. Notwithstanding this delay, we expect to achieve stabilized occupancy during the three months ending December 31, 2020, consistent with prior projections. 

As of December 31, 2019, our total estimated net investment at redevelopment and development communities is $577.5 million, with a projected weighted-average net operating income yield on these investments of 5.3%, assuming untrended rents. As of December 31, 2019, $309.2 million of this total has been funded. The remaining estimated net investment of $268.3 million on these communities is expected to be funded in 2020 and future years, on a leverage-neutral basis, with proceeds from sales of apartment communities with lower forecasted FCF internal rates of return. 

When possible, we prefer redevelopments that can be completed one apartment home at a time, when that home is vacated and available for renovation, or one floor at a time, thereby limiting the number of down homes and lease-up risk. We currently have six short-cycle projects, including Bay Parc, ongoing in our portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed 150 apartment homes, with another 21 homes under construction as of December 31, 2019. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we leased 251 redeveloped or newly developed apartment homes. As of December 31, 2019, our exposure to lease-up at active redevelopment and developments was 866 apartment homes, or less than 3% of our homes.

Portfolio Management 

Our portfolio of apartment communities is diversified across “A,” “B,” and “C+” price points, averaging “B/B+” in quality, and is also diversified across several of the largest markets in the United States. We measure the quality of apartment communities in our portfolio based on average rents of our apartment homes compared to local market average rents as reported by a third-party provider of commercial real estate performance and analysis. Under this rating system, we classify as “A” quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than 125% of local market average; as “B” quality apartment communities those earning rents between 90% and 125% of local market average; as “C+” quality apartment communities those earning rents greater than $1,100 per month, but lower than 90% of local market average; and as “C” quality apartment communities those earning rents less than $1,100 per month and lower than 90% of local market average. We classify as “B/B+” quality a portfolio that on average earns rents between 100% and 125% of local market average rents. Although some companies and analysts within the multifamily real estate industry use apartment community quality ratings of “A,” “B,” and “C,” some of which are tied to local market rent averages, the metrics used to classify apartment community quality as well as the period for which local market rents are calculated may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our rating system for measuring apartment community quality is neither broadly nor consistently used in the multifamily real estate industry. 

The following table summarizes information about our portfolio relative to the market for the three months ended December 31, 2019: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Represents average monthly rental and other property revenues (excluding resident reimbursement of utility cost) divided by the number of occupied apartment homes as of the end of the period. 

Our average revenue per apartment home was $2,272 for the three months ended December 31, 2019, representing an increase of 7% compared to the same period in 2018, and a 7.2% compounded annual growth rate over the past five years. This increase is due to growth in Same Store revenue as well as our acquisition activities, lease-up of redevelopment and acquisition communities, and the sale of communities with average monthly revenues per apartment home lower than those of the retained portfolio. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we reallocated capital from slower-growth markets such as Chicago and reinvested the proceeds in higher-growth markets such as Miami, Denver, and Boston. 

As part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell up to 10% of our portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, some developments, and selective acquisitions with projected FCF internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. Through this disciplined approach to capital recycling, we increase the quality and expected growth rate of our portfolio. 

As we execute our portfolio strategy, we expect to increase average revenue per Aimco apartment home at a rate greater than market rent growth, increase FCF margins, and maintain sufficient geographic and price point diversification to limit volatility and concentration risk. 

Acquisitions 

We follow a disciplined paired trade policy in making investments. We evaluate potential acquisitions seeking FCF internal rates of returns higher than those of the communities being sold. We prefer well-located real estate where land is a significant percentage of total value and provides potential upside from development or redevelopment.  

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we acquired three properties: One Ardmore in Ardmore, Pennsylvania; Prism (50 Rogers), a community under construction in Cambridge, Massachusetts; and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive in Miami, Florida. Together, these acquisitions have an expected weighted-average FCF internal rate of return of 9%, approximately 300 basis points better than expected from the properties being sold, or to be sold, in paired trades to fund the acquisitions. 

Mezzanine Investment 

On November 26, 2019, we made a five-year, $275.0 million mezzanine loan at a 10% annual rate to the partnership owning Parkmerced Apartments. The loan is secured by a second-priority deed of trust. We simultaneously received a ten-year  

22 

Table of Contents 

option to acquire a 30% interest in the partnership at an exercise price of $1.0 million, increased by 30% of future capital spending to progress development and redevelopment of Parkmerced Apartments. 

Parkmerced Apartments is a 152-acre site in the southwest corner of San Francisco, currently improved with 3,221 apartment homes completed shortly before and after World War II. These apartment homes are subject to City of San Francisco rent control. The development of the site is governed by a development agreement that allows for 8,900 total residential units, with the new units exempt from City of San Francisco rent control. The partnership, which is the borrower and in which we have the option to acquire 30% ownership, owns 3,165 of the existing rent-controlled apartment homes, which excludes apartment homes transferred as part of an earlier phase of development to which we are not a party, as well as the vested right to develop 4,093 of the new market-rate homes.  

The mezzanine loan provides us with current income with minimal expected downside risk. The option is expected to provide us with an opportunity to participate in substantial value creation from the vested development rights. 

Dispositions 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold 12 apartment communities, generating net proceeds of $619.4 million used to fund acquisitions, redevelopment, development, the repurchase of Aimco shares in the fourth quarter of 2018, and other capital investments. We delayed approximately $300 million of planned fourth quarter 2019 and January 2020 sales. While this delay temporarily increased leverage, we expect a better execution as the transaction market remains deep, liquid, and attractively priced.  

Balance Sheet 

Leverage 

Our leverage strategy seeks to increase financial returns by using leverage with appropriate caution. We limit risk through our balance sheet structure, employing low leverage, primarily non-recourse and long-dated property debt; build financial flexibility by maintaining ample unused and available credit as well as holding properties with substantial value unencumbered by property debt; and use partners’ capital when it enhances financial returns or reduces investment risk. 

Our leverage includes our share of long-term, non-recourse property debt encumbering apartment communities, outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility, outstanding preferred equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests in a consolidated real estate partnership. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for additional information regarding our leverage. 

Our target leverage ratios are Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDAre below 7.0x and Adjusted EBITDAre to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends greater than 2.5x. Our leverage ratios for the three months ended December 31, 2019, are presented below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We calculate Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted Interest Expense used in our leverage ratios based on the most recent three month amounts, annualized. The sales delay mentioned above increased Proportionate Debt to Adjusted EBITDAre and Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDAre by 0.3x as of December 31, 2019. We expect a gradual decline in leverage to EBITDAre ratios throughout 2020, reaching approximately 6.4x and 6.5x, respectively, at year end. In future years, we expect earnings growth from completed redevelopments will increase EBITDAre and further reduce our leverage ratios. 

Please refer to the Leverage Ratios subsection of the Non-GAAP Measures section for further information about the calculation of our leverage ratios. 

Refinancing Activity 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we financed $772.6 million of new non-recourse, fixed-rate property debt. These loans have a weighted-average interest rate of 3.32%, a weighted-average term to maturity of 11.4 years, and contributed an approximately 29 basis point decrease in our annual cost of leverage compared to 2018.

Table of Contents 

Liquidity 

Our liquidity consists of cash balances and available capacity on our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and restricted cash of $177.7 million and had the capacity to borrow up to $517.8 million on our revolving credit facility, after consideration of $7.2 million letters of credit backed by the facility. We use our credit facility primarily for working capital and other short-term purposes and to secure letters of credit. 

We manage our financial flexibility by maintaining an investment grade rating and holding apartment communities that are unencumbered by property debt. As of December 31, 2019, we held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $2.4 billion. 

Two credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness, using different methodologies and ratios for assessing our credit, and both have rated our credit and outlook as BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Although some of the ratios they use are similar to those we use to measure our leverage, there are differences in our methods of calculation and therefore our leverage ratios disclosed above are not indicative of the ratios that may be calculated by these agencies. 

Equity Capital Activities 

On February 3, 2019, Aimco’s Board of Directors declared a special dividend on the common stock that consisted of $67.1 million in cash and 4.5 million shares of Common Stock. The special dividend also included the regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.39 per share. Simultaneously, Aimco’s Board of Directors authorized a reverse stock split, effective on February 20, 2019, in which every 1.03119 Aimco common share was combined into one Aimco common share, which was effective at the close of business on February 20, 2019. Taken together, the total number of shares outstanding after the stock dividend and reverse split was unchanged from the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the two actions. Please refer to Notes 7 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further information regarding these transactions and the corresponding impact to the Aimco Operating Partnership’s common unitholders.  

On January 28, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.41 per share of Common Stock, representing an increase of 5% compared to the regular quarterly dividends paid in 2019. This amount is payable on February 28, 2020, to stockholders of record on February 14, 2020. 

Team and Culture 

Our team and culture are keys to our success. Our intentional focus on a collaborative and productive culture based on respect for others and personal responsibility is reinforced by a preference for promotion from within. We focus on succession planning and talent development to produce a strong, stable team that is the enduring foundation of our success. We offer benefits reinforcing our value of caring for each other, including paid time for parental leave, paid time annually to volunteer in local communities, college scholarships for the children of team members, an emergency fund to help team members in crisis, financial support for our team members who are becoming United States citizens, and a bonus structure at all levels of the organization. We also pay full compensation and benefits for team members who are actively deployed by the United States military. Out of hundreds of participating companies in 2019, Aimco was one of only seven recognized as a “Top Workplace” in Colorado for each of the past seven years. Aimco was also recognized as a Top Workplace in the Bay Area in 2019. Also in 2019, Aimco was the only real estate company to receive a BEST award from the Association for Talent Development in recognition of our company-wide success in talent development, marking our second consecutive year receiving this award. 

Results of Operations 

Because our operating results depend primarily on income from our apartment communities, the supply of and demand for apartments influences our operating results. Additionally, the level of expenses required to operate and maintain our apartment communities and the pace and price at which we redevelop, acquire, and dispose of our apartment communities affect our operating results. 

The following discussion and analysis of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements in Item 8.   

Year Ended December 31, 2019, Compared to December 31, 2018 

Net income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership decreased by $192.1 million and $200.5 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018, as described more fully below.

Property Operations 

We have four segments: Same Store, Redevelopment and Development, Acquisition, and Other Real Estate. Our Same Store segment includes communities that have reached a stabilized level of operations as of the beginning of a two-year comparable period and maintained it throughout the current and comparable prior year, and are not expected to be sold within 12 months. Our Redevelopment and Development segment includes communities that are currently under construction that have not achieved a stabilized level of operations, and those that have been completed in recent years that have not achieved and maintained stabilized operations for both the current and comparable prior year. Our Acquisition segment includes those communities that we have acquired since the beginning of a two-year comparable period. Our Other Real Estate segment primarily includes apartment communities that are subject to limitations on rent increases, apartment communities that we expect to sell within 12 months but do not yet meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale, certain retail spaces, and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive. 

As of December 31, 2019, our Same Store segment included 91 apartment communities with 26,649 apartment homes. 

From December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019, on a net basis, our Same Store segment decreased by two apartment communities and increased by 744 apartment homes. These changes consisted of: 

•  

the addition of eight redeveloped and developed apartment communities with 3,008 apartment homes previously classified in the Redevelopment and Development segment, now classified as Same Store upon maintaining stabilized operations for the entirety of the periods presented; 

•  

the addition of one apartment community with 463 apartment homes, previously classified in the Acquisition segment, now classified as Same Store because we have now owned it for the entirety of both periods presented; 

•  

the addition of one apartment community with 246 apartment homes, previously classified in the Other Real Estate segment, which maintained stabilized operations for the entirety of the periods presented following a casualty event; 

•  

the addition of one apartment community with 72 apartment homes that we separated into a newly branded stand-alone community from an existing community that was previously classified in the Redevelopment and Development segment, resulting in an increase of one community with no change in the total number of apartment homes; 

•  

the reduction of two apartment communities with 153 apartment homes for which we commenced redevelopment during the period and were reclassified to the Redevelopment and Development segment; 

•  

the reduction of one apartment community with 78 apartment homes that we expect to sell within 12 months that is now classified in the Other Real Estate segment; and 

•  

the reduction of 10 apartment communities with 2,814 apartment homes that were sold as of December 31, 2019. 

As of December 31, 2019: our Redevelopment and Development segment included seven apartment communities with 3,143 apartment homes; our Acquisition segment included seven apartment communities with 1,590 apartment homes; and our Other Real Estate segment included 15 apartment communities with 1,315 apartment homes and one office building. 

We use proportionate property net operating income to assess the operating performance of our communities. Proportionate property net operating income reflects our share of rental and other property revenues, excluding resident utility reimbursement, less direct property operating expenses, net of resident utility reimbursement, for consolidated communities. Accordingly, the results of operations of our segments discussed below are presented on a proportionate basis and exclude the results of four apartment communities with 142 apartment homes that we do not consolidate.  

We do not include offsite costs associated with property management, casualty losses, or the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale, reported in consolidated amounts, in our assessment of segment performance. Accordingly, these items are not allocated to our segment results discussed below.  

Please refer to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for further discussion regarding our segments, including a reconciliation of these proportionate amounts to consolidated rental and other property revenues attributable to real estate and property operating expenses attributable to real estate.

Proportionate Property Net Operating Income 

The results of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2019. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, our Same Store proportionate property net operating income increased by $21.2 million, or 4.3%. This increase was attributable primarily to a $25.5 million, or 3.8%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues of $69 per apartment home comprised of increases in rental rates and a 60 basis point increase in average daily occupancy. Renewal rents increased by 4.9% and new lease rents increased by 1.9%, resulting in a weighted-average increase of 3.4%. The increase in Same Store rental and other property revenues was offset partially by a $4.3 million, or 2.4%, increase in property operating expenses due primarily to higher real estate taxes. Controllable operating expenses, which exclude utility costs, real estate taxes, and insurance, were flat for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. 

Redevelopment and Development proportionate property net operating income decreased by $1.2 million, or 2.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This decrease was attributable primarily to de-leasing at Flamingo Point and 707 Leahy in preparation for redevelopment, offset partially by increased occupancy driven by the lease-up of Park Towne Place.  

Acquisition proportionate property net operating income increased by $10.1 million, or 49.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This increase was attributable primarily to the 2019 acquisition of One Ardmore and a full period of operating activity at the four Philadelphia communities acquired in 2018, compared to eight months of operations during the year ended December 31, 2018.  

Other Real Estate proportionate property net operating income increased by $4.7 million, or 20.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 due primarily to the acquisition of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive in 2019.  

Year Ended December 31, 2018, Compared to December 31, 2017 

Net income attributable to Aimco and net income attributable to the Aimco Operating Partnership increased by $350.5 million and $370.4 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to 2017, as described more fully below.  

Proportionate Property Net Operating Income 

As of December 31, 2018, excluding apartment communities sold during 2019: our Same Store segment consisted of 83 Same Store apartment communities with 23,091 apartment homes; our Redevelopment and Development segment included 13 apartment communities with 6,294 apartment homes; our Acquisition segment included seven apartment communities with 1,943 apartment homes; and our Other Real Estate segment included 15 apartment communities with 1,483 apartment homes. 

The results of our segments for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, as presented below, are based on the apartment community classifications as of December 31, 2018, and exclude amounts related to apartment communities sold

Table of Contents 

during 2019. Based on the nature of our apartment community classifications, there is no comparison of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The results of operations for these communities are reflected in the table below.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, Same Store proportionate property net operating income increased by $12.3 million, or 3.2%. This increase was attributable primarily to a $17.0 million, or 3.3%, increase in rental and other property revenues due to higher average revenues of $53 per apartment home comprised of increases in rental rates and a 60 basis point increase in average daily occupancy. Renewal rents increased by 4.9% and new lease rents increased by 1.9%, resulting in a weighted-average increase of 3.4%. The increase in Same Store and other property revenues was offset partially by a $4.7 million, or 3.5%, increase in property operating expenses due primarily to increases in real estate taxes and repairs and maintenance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, controllable operating expenses increased by $1.0 million, or 1.5%.  

Redevelopment and Development proportionate property net operating income increased by $18.8 million, or 18.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017 due to leasing activities at communities, offset partially by decreases due to apartment homes taken out of service for redevelopment. 

Acquisition proportionate property net operating income increased by $24.0 million, or 230.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017 due to the 2018 acquisitions of Bent Tree Apartments, Avery Row, and four apartment communities in Philadelphia.  

Non-Segment Real Estate Operations 

Operating income amounts not attributed to our segments include offsite costs associated with property management, casualty losses, and the results of apartment communities sold or held for sale, reported in consolidated amounts, which we do not allocate to our segments for purposes of evaluating segment performance. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, casualty losses totaled $9.0 million, $4.0 million, and $8.2 million, respectively. Casualty losses during the year ended December 31, 2019, included one major claim due to storm-related flooding at our One Canal apartment community and several other claims due to fire damage. Casualty losses for the year ended December 31, 2018, included several claims due primarily to storm and fire damage, offset partially by recovery from insurance carriers for insured losses in excess of policy limits. Casualty losses were elevated during the year ended December 31, 2017, due primarily to hurricane damage. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, apartment communities that were sold or classified as held for sale generated net operating income of $16.6 million, $54.6 million, and $91.1 million, respectively.

Asset Management Results 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, there was no net operating income attributable to the Asset Management business, which we sold in July 2018.  

For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, net operating income attributable to the Asset Management business was $28.9 million and $51.8 million, respectively.  

Depreciation and Amortization 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $2.4 million and $11.6 million, respectively, due primarily to apartment communities acquired in 2019 and 2018 and renovated apartment homes placed in service after their completion. This increase was offset partially by decreases in depreciation associated with apartment communities sold and with communities owned by partnerships served by our Asset Management business, which we sold in 2018.  

General and Administrative Expenses 

General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019, were relatively flat compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, general and administrative expenses increased $2.6 million, due primarily to higher variable incentive compensation cost.

Other expenses, net, includes costs associated with our risk management activities, partnership administration expenses, and certain non-recurring items. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, other expenses, net, increased by $15.3 million, related primarily to the resolution of our litigation against Airbnb in 2018 and an increase in rent expense associated with our ground leases. 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, other expenses, net, decreased by $7.4 million, due primarily to the resolution of our litigation against Airbnb and settlement of litigation related to the challenge to the title of the La Jolla Cove property, which we acquired in 2014. 

Provision for Real Estate Impairment Loss 

We recognized no provisions for impairment losses during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018. 

In January 2018, we agreed to sell our interests in the entities owning the La Jolla Cove property in settlement of legal actions filed in 2014 by a group of disappointed buyers who had hoped to acquire the property. As a result of the settlement, we recognized in our 2017 results a gross impairment loss of $35.8 million, $25.6 million of which related to the establishment of a deferred tax liability assumed in connection with our acquisition of the business entities. The tax liability was assumed by the buyer, resulting in no economic loss to us. The remaining $10.2 million loss was offset by cash distributions paid to us during our ownership and avoided legal costs for continued litigation. On an economic basis, we agreed to sell these entities at roughly our purchase price, adjusted for retained cash distributions and avoided legal costs. 

Interest Income 

Interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was relatively flat compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, interest income increased $2.6 million, due primarily to interest earned on the seller financing notes received as consideration in the sale of the La Jolla Cove property. 

Interest Expense 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, interest expense, which includes the amortization of debt issuance costs, decreased by $31.8 million due primarily to lower interest on property-level debt following refinancing and debt payoff activity, including the 2018 repayment of our term loan, a decrease in property-level debt attributable to sold communities and an increase in capitalized interest attributable to redevelopment and development communities. This decrease was offset partially by interest on property-level debt assumed in connection with our acquisitions and a $9.9 million decrease in prepayment penalties.  

28 

Table of Contents 

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, interest expense increased by $6.0 million. The increase was due primarily to debt prepayment penalties of $14.9 million incurred in connection with 2018 refinancing of property-level debt that was scheduled to mature in 2019, 2020, and 2021, offset partially by a decrease in mortgage interest expense for communities sold and the sale of the Asset Management business in July 2018, and lower corporate-level interest. 

Gain on Dispositions of Real Estate and the Asset Management Business 

The table below summarizes dispositions of apartment communities from our portfolio during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (dollars in millions): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold for $590 million our Asset Management business and our four Hunters Point communities, which are excluded from the table above. 

(2)  

Net proceeds are after repayment of debt, if any, net working capital settlements, payment of transaction costs, and debt prepayment penalties, if applicable. 

The apartment communities sold from our portfolio during 2019, 2018, and 2017 were primarily located outside of our primary markets or in lower-rated locations within our primary markets and had average revenues per apartment home significantly below those of our retained portfolio. 

Income from Unconsolidated Real Estate Partnerships 

Income from unconsolidated real estate partnerships for the year ended December 31, 2019, was relatively flat compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, income from unconsolidated real estate partnerships decreased by $7.6 million, due primarily to the derecognition of the final NAPICO property in 2017, which resulted in a gain. 

Income Tax Benefit 

Certain of our operations, including property management and risk management, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRS entities. Additionally, some of our apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive are owned through TRS entities. 

Our income tax benefit calculated in accordance with GAAP includes: (a) income taxes associated with the income or loss of our TRS entities including tax on gains on dispositions, for which the tax consequences have been realized or will be realized in future periods; (b) low income housing tax credits generated prior to the sale of our Asset Management business that offset REIT taxable income, primarily from retained capital gains; and (c) historic tax credits that offset income tax obligations of our TRS entities. Income taxes related to these items, as well as changes in valuation allowance and the establishment of incremental deferred tax items in conjunction with intercompany asset transfers (if applicable), are included in income tax benefit in our consolidated statements of operations. 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, income tax benefit decreased $9.9 million. The decrease is due primarily to lower tax benefit recognized in connection with the intercompany transfer of assets and release of a valuation allowance in 2018 related to sale of our Asset Management business, as well as lower tax benefit from historic tax credits. This decrease is offset partially by a lower tax provision on gains on dispositions.  

For the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017, income tax benefit decreased by $17.8 million. The decrease is due primarily to the reversal of a $19.3 million net tax benefit we recognized as a result of the December 2017 tax reform legislation in 2017 and higher tax expense related to gains on sale of real estate for communities held through TRS entities. 

Non-GAAP Measures 

Various key financial indicators we use in managing our business and in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance are non-GAAP measures. Key non-GAAP measures we use are defined and described below, and for those non-GAAP measures used or disclosed within this annual report, we provide reconciliations of the non-GAAP measures to the most comparable financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP. 

29 

Table of Contents 

Free Cash Flow, as calculated for our retained portfolio, represents an apartment community’s property net operating income, less spending for Capital Replacements, which represents our estimation of the capital additions made to replace capital assets consumed during our ownership period (further discussed under the Nareit Funds From Operations, Pro forma Funds From Operations, and Adjusted Funds From Operations heading). FCF margin as calculated for apartment communities sold represents the sold apartment community’s net operating income less $1,200 per apartment home of assumed annual capital replacement spending, as a percentage of the apartment community’s rental and other property revenues. Capital replacement spending represents a measure of capital asset usage during the period; therefore, we believe that FCF is useful to investors as a supplemental measure of apartment community performance because it takes into consideration costs incurred during the period to replace capital assets that have been consumed during our ownership. 

Economic Income 

Economic Income represents stockholder value creation as measured by the change in estimated NAV per share plus cash dividends per share. We believe Economic Income is important to investors as it represents a measure of the total return we have earned for our stockholders. NAV, as used in our calculation of Economic Income, is a non-GAAP measure and represents the estimated fair value of assets net of liabilities attributable to Aimco’s common stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s common unitholders on a diluted basis. We believe NAV is considered useful by some investors in real estate companies because the value of company assets can be readily estimated, even for non-earning assets such as land or properties under development. NAV has the advantage of incorporating the investment decisions of thousands of real estate investors. We believe it enhances comparability among companies that have differences in their accounting. Although, NAV is not identical to liquidation value in that some costs and benefits are disregarded, it is often considered a floor with upside for value ascribed to the operating platform. NAV also provides an objective basis for the perceived quality and predictability of future cash flows as well as their expected growth as these are factors considered by real estate investors. 

Our estimated NAV per share and the quoted share price of Aimco Common Stock are not necessarily equal. Although we use Economic Income and NAV for comparability in assessing our value creation compared to other REITs, not all REITs publish these measures and those who do may not compute them in the same manner. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these measures is comparable with that of other REITs. 

We report NAV on a semiannual basis, as of the end of the first and third quarters. Economic Income for 2019 was calculated using the change in NAV per share between September 30, 2018 and 2019. NAV will fluctuate over time. This NAV information should not be relied upon as representative of the amount a stockholder could expect to receive in a liquidation event, now or in the future. Certain assets are excluded as are certain liabilities, such as taxes and transaction costs associated with a liquidation. In addition, NAV is based on management’s subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions as of the date of determination. We assume no obligation to revise or update NAV to reflect subsequent or future events or circumstances. Our NAV estimate is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation, those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 

Economic Income does not represent the change in stockholder’s equity in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, NAV does not represent stockholder’s equity in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to Aimco’s total equity, which we believe is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. A reconciliation of NAV to Aimco’s total equity, as of September 30, 2019, is provided below (in millions, except per share data):

(1)  

We compute NAV by estimating the value of our communities, using methods we believe are appropriate based on the characteristics of the communities. For purposes of estimating NAV, real estate at fair value disclosed above includes wholly owned apartment communities and 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, plus our proportionate share of communities held by non-wholly owned entities (both consolidated and unconsolidated). A reconciliation of our consolidated apartment communities to those communities included in total real estate at fair value in the table above is as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For valuation purposes at September 30, 2019, we segregated these 132 properties into the following categories: stabilized portfolio and non-stabilized portfolio. 

(2)  

As of September 30, 2019, our stabilized portfolio includes 121 communities that had reached stabilized operations and were not expected to be sold within 12 months. We value this portfolio using a direct capitalization rate method based on the annualized proportionate property net operating income, for the three months ended September 30, 2019, less a 2% management fee. Market property management fees range between 2.0% and 3.0% with larger, higher quality portfolios at the lower end of that range. The weighted-average estimated capitalization rate as applied to the annualized proportionate property net operating income was 4.9%, which we calculate on a property-by-property basis, based primarily on information published by a third party. Community characteristics that we use to determine comparable market capitalization rates include: the market in which the community is located; infill or suburban location within the market; property quality grade; and whether the community is stabilized or value-add. We used this valuation method for approximately 87% of real estate fair value at September 30, 2019. 

(3)  

The non-stabilized portfolio includes three communities under development and four communities under redevelopment as of September 30, 2019. We valued these communities by discounting projected future cash flows. Key assumptions used to estimate the value of these communities include: revenues, which are based on in-place rents, projected submarket rent growth to community stabilization based on projections published by third parties and adjusted for the impacts of redevelopment; expenses, which are based on estimated operating costs adjusted for inflation and a management fee equal to 2% of projected revenue; estimated remaining costs to complete construction; and a terminal value based on current market capitalization rates plus five basis points per year from September 30, 2019, to community stabilization. Discount rates applied to estimated future cash flows of these communities ranged between 5.10% and 6.30%, depending on construction and lease-up progress as of September 30, 2019. We used this valuation method for approximately 11% of the real estate fair value at September 30, 2019. The non-stabilized portfolio also included three recently acquired apartment communities, 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, and certain land investments valued at our cost plus incremental investment subsequent to acquisition. We used this valuation method for approximately 2% of real estate fair value at September 30, 2019. Our calculation of NAV does not include such future values as air rights, the potential for increased density, nor the potential for completion of future phases of redevelopments. 

(4)  

We calculate the fair value of indebtedness related to real estate as the carrying value of our non-recourse property debt adjusted for the mark-to-market asset on our fixed-rate property debt as of September 30, 2019, plus the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility, which approximates its fair value as of September 30, 2019. The fair value of debt takes into account the duration of the existing property debt, as well as the quality of property pledged as its security, its loan to value ratio, and debt service coverage. For purposes of estimating NAV, the fair value of debt includes our proportionate share of debt related to non-wholly owned entities (both consolidated and unconsolidated). 

(5)  

Other tangible assets consist of cash, restricted cash, accounts receivable, and other assets for which we reasonably expect to receive cash through the normal course of operations or another future event. Other tangible liabilities consist of accounts payable, accrued liabilities, and other tangible liabilities we reasonably expect to settle in cash through the normal course of operations or another future event. Other tangible assets and liabilities were generally valued at their carrying amounts and reduced by the noncontrolling interests’ portion of these amounts and exclude intangible assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. For purposes of this NAV calculation, we have assigned no realizable value to right of use assets, goodwill, or other intangible assets. We also exclude deferred income and right of use related lease liabilities from the NAV calculation. We exclude from this NAV calculation deferred income, which includes below market lease liabilities, recognized in accordance with GAAP in connection with the purchase of the related apartment communities, and cash received in prior periods and required to be deferred under GAAP. We also adjust other tangible liabilities to reflect removal of the deferred tax liability associated with 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, which is not expected to be paid during our ownership of the property. We include the value of our deferred tax asset, as the value of the asset is expected to be realized in the normal course of business. 

(6)  

Total shares, units, and dilutive share equivalents represents Common Stock, OP Units, participating unvested restricted shares, and the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents outstanding as of September 30, 2019. 

Nareit Funds From Operations, Pro forma Funds From Operations, and Adjusted Funds From Operations 

Nareit FFO is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets such as machinery, computers, or other personal property. Nareit defines FFO as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding: depreciation and amortization related to real estate; gains and losses from sales and impairment of depreciable assets and land used in our primary business; and income taxes directly associated with a gain or loss on the sale of real estate, and including our share of the FFO of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis to determine Nareit  

31 

Table of Contents 

FFO. We calculate Nareit FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted) by subtracting dividends on preferred stock and amounts allocated from Nareit FFO to participating securities. 

In addition to Nareit FFO, we compute Pro forma FFO and AFFO, which are also non-GAAP financial measures that we believe are helpful to investors in understanding our short-term performance. Pro forma FFO represents Nareit FFO attributable to Aimco common stockholders (diluted), excluding certain amounts that are unique or occur infrequently. 

In computing 2019 Pro forma FFO, we made the following adjustments to Nareit FFO: 

•  

Prepayment penalties: as a result of refinancing activity in 2019, we incurred debt extinguishment costs. We excluded such costs from Pro forma FFO because we believe these costs are not representative of ongoing operating performance. 

•  

Straight-line rent: in 2018, we assumed a 99-year ground lease with scheduled rent increases. Due to the terms of the lease, GAAP rent expense will exceed cash rent payments until 2076. We include the cash rent payments for this ground lease in Pro forma FFO but exclude the incremental straight-line non-cash rent expense. We include the rent expense for this lease in other expenses, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. 

•  

Preferred equity redemption-related amounts: on May 16, 2019, we redeemed our Class A Perpetual Preferred Stock. We excluded the redemption-related costs from Pro forma FFO because we believe these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

•  

Casualty losses: in 2019, we incurred casualty losses due to storm-related flooding in downtown Boston that caused damage to our One Canal apartment community. We excluded these costs from Pro forma FFO because of the unusual nature of the weather event that caused the loss. 

•  

Severance and restructuring costs: in 2019, we incurred severance and restructuring costs in connection with the closure and relocation of administrative functions from our Greenville and Indianapolis offices to our Denver office. We excluded such costs from Pro forma FFO because we believe these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

In computing 2018 Pro forma FFO, we made the following adjustments to Nareit FFO: 

•  

Prepayment penalties: in 2018, we addressed approximately half of our property loans maturing in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In connection with this activity, we incurred debt extinguishment costs, which we have excluded from Pro forma FFO because we believe these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

•  

Severance and restructuring costs: in connection with the sale of our Asset Management business in 2018, we incurred severance and restructuring costs. We excluded such costs from Pro forma FFO because we believe these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

•  

Litigation: during 2018, we were engaged in litigation with Airbnb, which was resolved in December 2018. Due to the unpredictable nature of these proceedings, we excluded from Pro Forma FFO related amounts recognized, net of income tax effect. We include these costs in other expenses, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. 

•  

Tax benefit due to valuation allowance release: due to the sale of the Asset Management business in 2018, we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer necessary. We excluded the effect of the establishment of the valuation allowance from Pro forma FFO and, as such, excluded the benefit from its release. 

•  

Change in lease accounting: effective January 1, 2019, we adopted accounting guidance that changed how we recognize costs incurred to obtain resident leases. For comparability of Pro forma FFO between periods, we have recast 2018 as if the new standard was effective as of January 1, 2018. AFFO is unchanged by the new standard. 

•  

Tax provision related to tax reform legislation: in connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law in December 2017, we recognized income tax benefit in 2017 and adjusted the estimated impact of tax reform upon the conclusion of our analysis of the effects during 2018. We excluded such amounts from Pro forma FFO as we believe these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

AFFO represents Pro forma FFO reduced by Capital Replacements, which represent our estimation of the actual capital additions made to replace capital assets consumed during our ownership period. When we make capital additions at an apartment community, we evaluate whether the additions extend the useful life of an asset as compared to its condition at the time we purchased the apartment community. We classify as Capital Improvements those capital additions that meet this criterion, and we classify as Capital Replacements those that do not. AFFO is a key financial indicator we use to evaluate our short-term operational performance and is one of the factors that we use to determine the amounts of our dividend payments. 

Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO, and AFFO should not be considered alternatives to net income determined in accordance with GAAP, as indications of our performance. Although we use these non-GAAP measures for comparability in assessing our  

32 

Table of Contents 

performance compared to other REITs, not all REITs compute these same measures and those who do may not compute them in the same manner. Additionally, computation of AFFO is subject to our definition of Capital Replacement spending. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other REITs. 

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Aimco’s Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO, and AFFO are calculated as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Represents the numerator for calculating Aimco’s earnings per common share in accordance with GAAP (please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8). 

(2)  

For the year ended December 31, 2019, income taxes related to gain on dispositions and other items primarily included tax on the gain on sale of apartment communities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, income taxes related to gain on dispositions and other items includes tax on the gain on the sale of the Asset Management business, as well as tax on the gain on the sale of apartment communities during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

(3)  

Represents the denominator for Aimco’s earnings per common share – diluted, calculated in accordance with GAAP. 

(4)  

During the three months ended March 31, 2019, we completed a reverse stock split and a special dividend paid primarily in stock. For stock splits, GAAP requires the restatement of weighted-average shares as if the reverse stock split occurred at the beginning of the period presented; while shares issued in the special dividend are included in weighted-average shares outstanding from the date issued. To minimize confusion and facilitate comparison of period-over-period Pro forma FFO and AFFO, we calculated pro forma weighted-average shares for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, based on the effective date of the reverse stock split and ex-dividend date for the shares issued in the special dividend, thereby eliminating the per-share impact of the GAAP treatment to Aimco's reported Pro forma FFO and AFFO. 

Please refer to the Results of Operations section for discussion of our Pro forma FFO and AFFO results for 2019, as compared to 2018.

Table of Contents 

The Aimco Operating Partnership does not separately compute or report Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO, or AFFO. However, based on Aimco’s method for allocation of such amounts to noncontrolling interests in the Aimco Operating Partnership, as well as limited differences between the amounts of net income attributable to Aimco’s common stockholders and the Aimco Operating Partnership’s unit holders during the periods presented, Nareit FFO, Pro forma FFO, and AFFO amounts on a per unit basis for the Aimco Operating Partnership would be expected to be substantially the same as the corresponding per share amounts for Aimco. 

Leverage Ratios 

As discussed under the Balance Sheet heading, our leverage strategy targets the ratio of Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity to Adjusted EBITDAre to be below 7.0x and the ratio of Adjusted EBITDAre to Adjusted Interest Expense and Preferred Dividends to be greater than 2.5x. We believe these ratios, which are based in part on non-GAAP financial information, are commonly used by investors and analysts to assess the relative financial risk associated with companies within the same industry, and they are believed to be similar to measures used by rating agencies to assess entity credit quality. 

Proportionate Debt, as used in our leverage ratios, is a non-GAAP measure and includes our share of the long-term, non-recourse property debt and outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Proportionate Debt excludes unamortized debt issuance costs because these amounts represent cash expended in earlier periods and do not reduce our contractual obligations. We reduce our recorded debt by the amounts of cash and restricted cash on-hand, which are primarily restricted under the terms of our property debt agreements, assuming these amounts would be used to reduce our outstanding leverage. We further reduce our recorded debt by the value of our investment in a securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, as our payments of principal and interest associated with such property debt will ultimately repay our investments in the trust. 

We believe Proportionate Debt is useful to investors as it is a measure of our net exposure to debt obligations. Proportionate Debt, as used in our leverage ratios, is calculated as set forth in the table below. 

Preferred Equity, as used in our leverage ratios, represents the redemption amounts for the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred OP Units. Preferred Equity, although perpetual in nature, is another component of our overall leverage.  

The reconciliation of total indebtedness to Proportionate Debt and Preferred Equity, as used in our leverage ratios as of December 31, 2019, is as follows (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We calculated Adjusted EBITDAre used in our leverage ratios based on the most recent three month amounts, annualized. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are non-GAAP measures, which we believe are useful to investors, creditors, and rating agencies as a supplemental measure of our ability to incur and service debt because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and allow for comparison of our credit strength to different companies. EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) as determined in accordance with GAAP as indicators of liquidity. There can be no assurance that our method of calculating EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts. Nareit defines EBITDAre as net income computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization expense, further adjusted for: 

•  

gains and losses on the dispositions of depreciated property; 

•  

impairment write-downs of depreciated property; 

•  

impairment write-downs of investments in unconsolidated partnerships caused by a decrease in the value of the depreciated property in such partnerships; and 

34 

Table of Contents 

•  

adjustments to reflect Aimco’s share of EBITDAre of investments in unconsolidated entities. 

We define Adjusted EBITDAre as EBITDAre adjusted to exclude the effect of the following items for the reasons set forth below: 

•  

net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and EBITDAre adjustments attributable to noncontrolling interests, to allow investors to compare a measure of our earnings before the effects of our capital structure and indebtedness with that of other companies in the real estate industry; 

•  

the amount of interest income related to our investment in the subordinated tranches in a securitization trust holding primarily Aimco property debt, as we view our interest cost on this debt to be net of any interest income received from the investment; and 

•  

the amount by which GAAP rent expense exceeds cash rents for a long-term ground lease for which expense exceeds cash payments until 2076. The excess of GAAP rent expense over the cash payments for this lease does not reflect a current obligation that affects our ability to service debt. 

EBITDAre is defined by Nareit and provides for an additional performance measure independent of capital structure for greater comparability between real estate investment trusts. The reconciliation of net income to EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre for the three months ended December 31, 2019, as used in our leverage ratios, is as follows (in thousands):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

In 2019, we incurred severance and restructuring costs in connection with office closures and relocation of administrative functions from our Greenville and Indianapolis offices to our Denver office. We excluded such costs from Adjusted EBITDAre because we believe these costs are not representative of operating performance. 

(2)  

We incurred casualty losses due to storm-related flooding in downtown Boston that caused damage to our One Canal apartment community. We excluded such costs from Adjusted EBITDAre because of the unusual nature of the weather event that caused the loss. 

(3)  

We calculated Adjusted EBITDAre on a pro forma basis to reflect the dispositions of four apartment communities during the period and the Parkmerced mezzanine loan investment, including related transaction costs, as if the transactions had closed on October 1, 2019. 

We calculate Adjusted Interest Expense, as used in our leverage ratios, based on the most recent three months, annualized. Adjusted Interest Expense is a non-GAAP measure that we believe is meaningful for investors and analysts as it presents our share of current recurring interest requirements associated with leverage. Adjusted Interest Expense represents our proportionate share of interest expense on non-recourse property debt and interest expense on our revolving credit facility borrowings. We exclude from our calculation of Adjusted Interest Expense: 

•  

debt prepayment penalties, which are items that, from time to time, affect our interest expense, but are not representative of our scheduled interest obligations; and 

•  

the income we receive on our investment in the securitization trust that holds certain of our property debt, as this income is being generated indirectly from interest we pay with respect to property debt held by the trust.

Preferred Dividends represents the distributions paid on the Aimco Operating Partnership’s preferred OP Units. We add Preferred Dividends to Adjusted Interest Expense for a more complete picture of the interest and dividend requirements of our leverage.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Liquidity 

Liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations. Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources are proceeds from dispositions of apartment communities, proceeds from refinancing existing property debt, borrowings under new property debt, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and proceeds from equity offerings. 

As of December 31, 2019, our primary sources of liquidity were as follows: 

•  

$142.9 million in cash and cash equivalents; 

•  

$34.8 million of restricted cash, which consists primarily of escrows related to resident security deposits and reserves and escrows held by lenders for capital additions, property taxes, and insurance; and 

•  

$517.8 million of available capacity to borrow under our revolving credit facility after consideration of $7.2 million of letters of credit backed by the facility. 

Our principal uses for liquidity include normal operating activities, payments of principal and interest on outstanding property debt, capital expenditures, dividends paid to stockholders, distributions paid to noncontrolling interest partners, and acquisitions of apartment communities. We use our cash and cash equivalents and our cash provided by operating activities to meet short-term liquidity needs. In the event that our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities are not sufficient to cover our short-term liquidity needs, we have additional means, such as short-term borrowing availability and proceeds from apartment community sales and refinancings. We may use our revolving credit facility for working capital and other short-term purposes, such as funding investments on an interim basis. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, such as debt maturities, redevelopment spending, and apartment community acquisitions, through primarily non-recourse, long-term borrowings, the issuance of equity securities (including OP Units), the sale of apartment communities, and cash generated from operations. 

As of December 31, 2019, we also held unencumbered apartment communities with an estimated fair market value of approximately $2.4 billion. 

Leverage and Capital Resources 

The availability of credit and its related effect on the overall economy may affect our liquidity and future financing activities, both through changes in interest rates and access to financing. Currently, interest rates are low compared to historical levels and many lenders are active in the market. However, any adverse changes in the lending environment could negatively affect our liquidity. We believe we have mitigated much of this exposure by reducing our short and intermediate term maturity risk through refinancing such loans with long-dated, fixed-rate property debt. However, if property financing options become unavailable for our future debt needs, we may consider alternative sources of liquidity, such as reductions in capital spending or proceeds from apartment community dispositions.

Two credit rating agencies rate our creditworthiness and both have rated our credit and outlook as BBB- (stable), an investment grade rating. Our investment grade rating would be useful in accessing capital through the sale of bonds in private or public transactions. However, our intention and historical practice has been to raise debt capital in the form of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt, the cost of which is generally less than that of recourse debt and the terms of which also provide for greater balance sheet safety. 

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 91.8% of our leverage consisted of property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, amortizing debt. Approximately 96.0% of our property-level debt is fixed-rate, which provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, capitalization rates, and inflation. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity of our property-level debt was 7.5 years. On average, 7.4% of our unpaid principal balances will mature each year from 2020 through 2022. 

During 2019, we financed $772.6 million of new non-recourse, fixed-rate property debt. These loans have a weighted-average interest rate of 3.32%, a weighted-average remaining term to maturity of 11.4 years, and contributed to an approximately 29 basis point decrease in our annual cost of leverage compared to 2018.  

While our primary source of leverage is property-level, non-recourse, long-dated, fixed-rate, amortizing debt, we also have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $275.0 million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which represented 6.0% of our total leverage. 

As of December 31, 2019, our outstanding preferred OP units represented approximately 2.1% of our total leverage. Preferred OP units are redeemable at the holder’s option; however, for illustrative purposes, we compute the weighted-average maturity of our total leverage assuming a 10-year maturity on the units. 

The combination of non-recourse property-level debt, borrowings under our revolving credit facility, preferred OP units, and redeemable noncontrolling interests in a consolidated real estate partnership comprise our total leverage. The weighted-average remaining term to maturity for our total leverage described above was 7.3 years as of December 31, 2019. 

Under the revolving credit facility, we have agreed to maintain a Fixed Charge Coverage ratio of 1.40x, as well as other covenants customary for similar revolving credit arrangements. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our Fixed Charge Coverage ratio was 2.06x, compared to ratio of 2.05x for the year ended December 31, 2018. We expect to remain in compliance with this covenant during the next 12 months. 

We like the discipline of financing our investments in real estate through the use of fixed-rate, amortizing, non-recourse property debt, as the amortization gradually reduces our leverage and reduces our refunding risk, and the fixed-rate provides a hedge against increases in interest rates, and the non-recourse feature avoids entity risk. 

Changes in Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash 

The following discussion relates to changes in consolidated cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash due to operating, investing, and financing activities, which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 8 of this report. 

Operating Activities 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash provided by operating activities was $374.5 million. Our operating cash flow is affected primarily by rental rates, occupancy levels, and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment communities. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, decreased by $21.9 million compared to 2018, due to lower net operating income associated with communities sold and the Asset Management business sold in 2018, offset partially by improved operating results of our Same Store communities and increased contribution from our Acquisition and Other Real Estate communities. 

Investing Activities 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities of $205.4 million consisted primarily of the cash payment for the mezzanine loan and related transaction costs, the acquisitions of 1001 Brickell Bay Drive, One Ardmore, and Prism, and capital expenditures, offset partially by proceeds from the disposition of 12 apartment communities.  

Capital additions for our segments totaled $396.0 million, $329.3 million, and $310.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We generally fund capital additions with cash provided by operating activities and cash proceeds from sales of apartment communities.

Table of Contents 

We categorize capital spending for communities in our portfolio broadly into seven primary categories: 

•  

capital replacements, which do not increase the useful life of an asset from its original purchase condition. Capital replacements represent capital additions made to replace the portion of our investment in acquired apartment communities consumed during our period of ownership; 

•  

capital improvements, which represent capital additions made to replace the portion of acquired apartment communities consumed prior to our period of ownership; 

•  

capital enhancements, which may include kitchen and bath remodeling, energy conservation projects, and investments in more durable, longer-lived materials designed to reduce costs, all of which differ from redevelopment additions in that they are generally lesser in scope and do not significantly disrupt property operations;  

•  

initial capital expenditures, which represent capital additions contemplated in the underwriting of our recently acquired communities; 

•  

redevelopment additions, which represent capital additions intended to enhance the value of the apartment community through the ability to generate higher average rental rates, and may include costs related to entitlement, which enhance the value of a community through increased density, and costs related to renovation of exteriors, common areas, or apartment homes;  

•  

development additions, which represent construction and related capitalized costs associated with the ground-up development of apartment communities; and  

•  

casualty capital additions, which represent capitalized costs incurred in connection with the restoration of an apartment community after a casualty event. 

We exclude the amounts of capital spending related to commercial spaces and to apartment communities sold or classified as held for sale at the end of the period from the foregoing measures. We have also excluded from these measures indirect capitalized costs, which are not yet allocated to communities with capital additions, and their related capital spending categories. 

A summary of the capital spending for these categories, along with a reconciliation of the total for these categories to the capital expenditures reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, are presented below (dollars in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we capitalized $11.8 million, $7.6 million, and $7.6 million of interest costs, respectively, and $37.8 million, $36.8 million, and $36.0 million of other direct and indirect costs, respectively. 

Redevelopment and Development 

As of December 31, 2019, our total estimated net investment in approved and active redevelopment and development is $577.5 million, with a projected weighted-average net operating income yield on these investments of 5.3%, assuming untrended rents. Of this total, we have funded $309.2 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect to fund the remaining estimated net investment of $268.3 million on these communities in 2020 and future years, on a leverage-neutral basis, with proceeds from sales of apartment communities with lower forecasted FCF internal rates of return.

We execute redevelopments using a range of approaches. We prefer to limit risk by executing redevelopments using a short-cycle approach, in which we renovate an apartment community in stages. Shorter cycles provide us the flexibility to maintain current earnings while aligning the timing of the completed apartment homes with market demand. We currently have six short-cycle projects, including Bay Parc, ongoing in our portfolio. During 2019, we completed 150 apartment homes, with another 21 homes under construction as of December 31, 2019. 

When short-cycle redevelopments are not possible, we may engage in redevelopment activities where an entire building or community is vacated. Additionally, we undertake some ground-up development when warranted by risk-adjusted investment returns, either directly or in connection with the redevelopment of an existing apartment community. The following table summarizes our investments related to these long-cycle developments and redevelopments as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Estimated net redevelopment investment represents the total actual or estimated investment, net of tax and other credits earned as a direct result of our redevelopment or development of the community. 

(2)  

Expected stabilized occupancy represents the period in which we expect to achieve stabilized occupancy, generally greater than 90%. 

(3)  

Expected net operating income, NOI, stabilization represents the period in which we expect the communities to achieve stabilized rents and operating costs, generally five quarters after occupancy stabilization. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested $229.8 million in redevelopment and development. Further details regarding our redevelopment and development activities, including apartment communities constructed and delivered during the year ended December 31, 2019, is discussed in the Executive Overview section above.  

We expect our total development and redevelopment spending to range from $250 million to $300 million for the year ending December 31, 2020. 

Financing Activities 

For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash used in financing activities of $64.0 million was attributed to the items discussed below. 

Net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $114.6 million primarily relate to the timing of short-term working capital needs. 

Principal payments on property loans during the period totaled $520.0 million, consisting of scheduled principal amortization of $79.7 million and repayments of $440.3 million. 

Proceeds from non-recourse property debt borrowings during the period consisted of the closing of 10 fixed-rate, amortizing, non-recourse property loans totaling $774.6 million. 

Repurchases of Preferred Stock of $125.0 million represents the cash paid upon redemption of our Class A Perpetual Preferred Stock during the 2019. 

Net cash used in financing activities also includes $266.2 million of payments to equity holders, as further detailed in the table below.

Contractual Obligations 

This table summarizes information contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding payments due under contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Includes scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments. 

(2)  

Includes outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility assuming repayment at the contractual maturity date. Our revolving credit facility is subject to an annual commitment fee (0.25% of aggregate commitments), which is not included in the amounts above. 

(3)  

Includes interest related to both fixed-rate and variable-rate non-recourse property debt, and our variable-rate revolving credit facility borrowings. Interest related to variable-rate debt is estimated based on the rate effective as of December 31, 2019. Please refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a description of average interest rates associated with our debt. 

(4)  

Operating lease obligations include both ground and office leases. Our ground leases expire in years ranging from 2070 to 2117. 

(5)  

Represents estimated obligations pursuant to construction contracts related to our redevelopment, development and other capital spending. Please refer to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for additional information regarding these obligations. 

In addition to the amounts presented in the table above, as of December 31, 2019, we had $97.1 million (liquidation value) of redeemable preferred OP Units of the Aimco Operating Partnership outstanding with annual distribution yields ranging from 1.92% to 8.75%. The distributions that accrue on the redeemable preferred OP Units are cumulative and are paid quarterly. 

Additionally, we may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our apartment communities. Those commitments generally have terms of one year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures. 

Future Capital Needs 

In addition to the items set forth in “Contractual Obligations” above, we expect to fund any future acquisitions, redevelopment, development, and other capital spending principally with proceeds from apartment community sales, short-term borrowings, debt and equity financing, and operating cash flows. Our near-term business plan does not contemplate the issuance of equity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 

Capitalized Costs 

We capitalize costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital additions activities, including redevelopments and developments, other tangible apartment community improvements, and replacements of existing community components. Included in these capitalized costs are payroll costs associated with time spent by employees in connection with the planning, execution, and control of all capital addition activities at the community level. We characterize as “indirect costs” an allocation of certain department costs, including payroll, at the area operations and corporate levels that clearly relate to capital addition activities. We also capitalize interest, property taxes, and insurance during periods in which redevelopments and developments are in progress. We commence capitalization of costs, including certain indirect costs, incurred in connection with our capital addition activities, at the point in time when activities necessary to get communities ready for their intended use begin. These activities include when communities or apartment homes are undergoing physical construction, as well as when homes are held vacant in advance of planned construction, provided that other activities such as permitting, planning, and design are in progress. We cease the capitalization of costs when the communities or components thereof are substantially complete and ready for their intended use, which is typically when construction has been completed and homes are available for occupancy. We charge costs including ordinary repairs, maintenance and resident turnover costs to property operating expense, as incurred. Please refer to the Investing Activities subsection to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section for a summary of costs capitalized during the periods presented. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

Real estate and other long-lived assets to be held and used are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an apartment community may not be recoverable, we make an assessment of its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to our estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows, excluding interest charges, of the community. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the community. 

As part of our portfolio strategy, we seek to sell up to 10% of our portfolio annually and to reinvest the proceeds from such sales in accretive uses such as capital enhancements, redevelopments, occasional developments, and selective acquisitions with projected FCF internal rates of return higher than expected from the communities being sold. As we execute this strategy, we evaluate alternatives to sell or reduce our interest in apartment communities that do not align with our long-term investment strategy, although there is no assurance that we will sell or reduce our investment in such communities during the desired time frame. For any communities that are sold or meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale during the next 12 months, the reduction in the estimated holding period for these communities may result in impairment losses.
