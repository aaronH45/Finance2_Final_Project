PART I.

ITEM 1.BUSINESS 

Perrigo Company plc was incorporated under the laws of Ireland on June 28, 2013. We became the successor registrant to Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation, on December 18, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of Elan Corporation, plc ("Elan"). Unless the context requires otherwise, the terms "Perrigo", the "Company", "we," "our," "us," and similar pronouns used herein refer to Perrigo Company plc, its subsidiaries, and all predecessors of Perrigo Company plc and its subsidiaries. 

WHO WE ARE

We are dedicated to making lives better by bringing “Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products™” that consumers trust everywhere they are sold. We are a leading provider of over-the-counter ("OTC") health and wellness solutions that enhance individual well-being by empowering consumers to proactively prevent or treat conditions that can be self-managed. We are also a leading producer of generic prescription pharmaceutical topical products such as creams, lotions, gels, and nasal sprays. We are headquartered in Ireland and sell our products primarily in North America and Europe as well as in other markets around the world.

Our vision is designed to support our shifting focus to our consumer branded and store brand portfolio and our global reach and the opportunities for growth we see ahead of us, while remaining loyal to our heritage. Our vision represents an evolution from healthcare to self-care, which takes advantage of a massive global trend and opens up a large number of adjacent growth opportunities. We define self-care as not just treating disease or helping individuals feel better after taking a product, but also maintaining and enhancing their overall health and wellness. In 2019, Perrigo’s management and Board of Directors launched a three-year strategy to transform the Company into a consumer self-care leader, consistent with our vision. Significant progress was made in the first year of our transformation journey towards achieving the major components of management’s transformation strategy, which consists of: reconfiguring the portfolio, delivering on base plans, creating repeatable platforms for growth, driving organizational effectiveness and capabilities, increasing productivity, allocating capital and delivering consistent and sustainable results in line with consumer-packaged goods peers.

Business Overview

Segments

Segment Reporting Change

During the three months ended March 30, 2019, we changed the composition of our operating and reporting segments. We moved our pharmaceuticals and diagnostic businesses in Israel from the Consumer Self-Care International segment to the Prescription Pharmaceuticals segment and we made certain adjustments to our allocations between segments. These changes were made to reflect changes in the way in which management makes operating decisions, allocates resources, and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. 

Our new reporting and operating segments are as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We previously had two legacy segments, Specialty Sciences and Other, which contained our Tysabri® financial asset and active pharmaceutical ingredient ("API") businesses, respectively, which we divested. Following these divestitures, there were no substantial assets or operations left in either of these segments. Effective January 1, 2017, all expenses associated with our former Specialty Sciences segment were moved to unallocated expenses. Financial information related to our business segments can be found in Item 8. Note 20. Our segments reflect the way in which our management makes operating decisions, allocates resources and manages the growth and profitability of the Company. 

MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN OUR BUSINESS

Ranir Global Holdings, LLC Acquisition

On July 1, 2019, we acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interest in Ranir Global Holdings, LLC ("Ranir"), a privately-held company. After post-closing adjustments, the total cash consideration paid was $747.7 million, net of $11.5 million cash acquired.

Ranir is headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is a leading global supplier of private label and branded oral self-care products. This transaction advances our transformation to a consumer-focused, self-care company while enhancing our position as a global leader in consumer self-care solutions. Ranir operations will be reported in our CSCA and CSCI segments (refer to Item 8. Note 3).

Planned RX Separation

We previously announced a plan to separate our RX business, which, when completed, will enable us to focus on expanding our consumer-focused businesses. In 2019, we continued preparations related to our planned separation, which may include a possible sale, spin-off, merger or other form of separation. While we remain committed to transforming to a consumer-focused business, we have not committed to a specific date or form for the separation. In connection with the proposed separation, we have incurred significant preparation costs and will continue to incur costs that, when completed, will be in the range of $45.0 million to $80.0 million, excluding restructuring expenses and transaction costs, depending on the timing and final structure of the transaction.

Internal Revenue Service Notice of Proposed Adjustments

On August 22, 2019, we received a draft NOPA from the IRS with respect to our fiscal tax years ended June 28, 2014 and June 27, 2015, relating to the deductibility of interest on $7.5 billion in debts owed to Perrigo Company plc by Perrigo Company, a Michigan corporation and wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Perrigo 

 3

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Business Overview

Company plc. The debts were incurred in connection with the Elan merger transaction in 2013. The draft NOPA would cap the interest rate on the debts for U.S. federal tax purposes at 130.0% of the Applicable Federal Rate (a blended rate reduction of 4.0% per annum from the rates agreed to by the parties), on the stated ground that the loans were not negotiated on an arms'-length basis. As a result of the proposed interest rate reduction, the draft NOPA proposes a reduction in gross interest expense of approximately $480.0 million for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. If the IRS were to prevail in its proposed adjustment, we estimate an increase in tax expense for such fiscal years of approximately $170.0 million, excluding interest and penalties. In addition, we would expect the IRS to seek similar adjustments for the period from June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. If those further adjustments were sustained, based on our preliminary calculations and subject to further analysis, our current best estimate is that the additional tax expense would not exceed $200.0 million, excluding interest and penalties, for the period June 28, 2015 through December 31, 2019. We do not expect any similar adjustments beyond December 31, 2019 as proposed regulations, issued under section 267A of the Internal Revenue Code, would eliminate the deductibility of interest on this debt. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies. No payment of any amount related to the proposed adjustments is required to be made, if at all, until all applicable proceedings have been completed. 

On April 26, 2019, we received a revised NOPA from the IRS regarding transfer pricing positions related to the IRS audit of Athena for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013. The NOPA carries forward the IRS's theory from its 2017 draft NOPA that when Elan took over the future funding of Athena’s in-process research and development after acquiring Athena in 1996, Elan should have paid a substantially higher royalty rate for the right to exploit Athena’s intellectual property, rather than rates based on transfer pricing documentation prepared by Elan's external tax advisors. The NOPA proposes a payment of $843.0 million, which represents additional tax and a 40.0% penalty. This amount excludes consideration of offsetting tax attributes and potentially material interest. We strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue all available administrative and judicial remedies, including potentially those available under the U.S. - Ireland Income Tax Treaty to alleviate double taxation. No payment of the additional amounts is required until the matter is resolved administratively, judicially, or through treaty negotiation. While we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is resolved unfavorably it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources.

Irish Tax Appeals Commission Notice of Amended Assessment

On October 30, 2018, we received an audit finding letter from the Irish Office of the Revenue Commissioners (“Irish Revenue”) for the years ended December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013. The audit finding letter relates to the tax treatment of the 2013 sale of the Tysabri® intellectual property and other assets related to Tysabri® to Biogen Idec from Elan Pharma. The consideration paid by Biogen to Elan Pharma took the form of an upfront payment and future contingent royalty payments. Irish Revenue issued a Notice of Amended Assessment ("NoA") on November 29, 2018, which assesses an Irish corporation tax liability against Elan Pharma in the amount of €1,636 million, not including interest or any applicable penalties.

We disagree with this assessment and believe that the NoA is without merit and incorrect as a matter of law. We filed an appeal of the NoA on December 27, 2018 and will pursue all available administrative and judicial avenues as may be necessary or appropriate. In connection with that, Elan Pharma was granted leave by the Irish High Court on February 25, 2019 to seek judicial review of the issuance of the NoA by Irish Revenue. The judicial review filing is based on our belief that Elan Pharma's legitimate expectations as a taxpayer have been breached, not on the merits of the NoA itself. The High Court has scheduled a hearing in this judicial review proceeding in April 2020, and we would expect a decision in this matter in the second half of 2020. If we are ultimately successful in the judicial review proceedings, the NoA will be invalidated and Irish Revenue will not be able to re-issue the NoA. The proceedings before the Tax Appeals Commission have been stayed until a decision on the judicial review application has been made. If for any reason the judicial review proceedings are ultimately unsuccessful in establishing that Irish Revenue's issuance of the NoA breaches our legitimate expectations, Elan Pharma will reactivate its appeal to challenge the merits of the NoA before the Tax Appeals Commission. While we believe our position to be correct, there can be no assurance of an ultimate favorable outcome, and if the matter is resolved unfavorably it could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources.

Business Overview

API Divestitures 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our India API business to Strides Shasun Limited for $22.2 million in proceeds. Prior to closing the sale, we determined that the carrying value of the India API business exceeded its fair value less the cost to sell, resulting in an impairment charge of $35.3 million, which was recorded in Impairment charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2016.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we completed the sale of our Israel API business to SK Capital, for a sale price of $110.0 million.

Financial Asset

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we divested the Tysabri® financial asset to Royalty Pharma for $2.2 billion in upfront cash and up to $250.0 million and $400.0 million in milestone payments. We received the $250.0 million royalty payment on February 22, 2019. In order for us to receive the milestone payment related to 2020 of $400.0 million, the payments received by Royalty Pharma from Biogen for Tysabri® sales in 2020 must exceed $351.0 million. The 2018 Royalty Pharma payments from Biogen for Tysabri® were $337.5 million.

We elected to account for the contingent milestone payments using the fair value option method, and these were recorded at an estimated fair value of $134.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Upon Tysabri® meeting the 2018 global net sales threshold we recorded a $170.1 million gain in Change in financial assets. The fair value of the milestone payment related to 2020 is $95.3 million as of December 31, 2019.

NEW PRODUCTS

We consider a product to be new if it (i) was reformulated, (ii) was a product line extension due to changes in characteristics such as strength, flavor, or color, (iii) had a change in product status from "prescription only" ("Rx") to OTC, (iv) was a new store brand or branded launch, (v) was provided in a new dosage form or (vi) was sold to a new geographic area with different regulatory authorities, in all cases, within 12 months prior to the end of the period for which net sales are being measured. During the year ended December 31, 2019, new product sales were $230.5 million.

CONSUMER SELF-CARE AMERICAS

Overview

The CSCA segment is focused primarily on the sale of store brand, self-care products in categories including upper respiratory, pain and sleep-aids, digestive health, nutrition, vitamins, minerals and supplements, healthy lifestyle, skincare and personal hygiene, and oral self-care in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, and South America. We are a leading provider of self-care products sold to consumers via store brands. Consumer awareness and knowledge of the quality and value that OTC store brand products represent continues to grow due to efforts made by store brand customers, retailers, and wholesalers to promote their own label programs. We also provide consumer self-care products under our own brands. During the year ended December 31, 2019, our CSCA segment represented approximately 51% of consolidated net sales. 

The CSCA segment develops, manufactures, and markets store brand, self-care products that are comparable in quality and effectiveness to national brands. Store brand products must meet the same U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") requirements as national brands within the U.S. and the requirements of comparable regulatory bodies outside the U.S. In most instances our product packaging is designed to invite and reinforce comparison to national brand products, while communicating store brand value to consumers.

The cost of store brand products to retailers is significantly lower than that of comparable nationally advertised brand name products. Generally, retailers’ dollar profit per unit of store brand product is greater than the dollar profit per unit of the comparable national brand product. The retailer, therefore, can price a store brand product below the competing national brand product and realize a greater profit margin. The consumer benefits by 

 5

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

CSCA

receiving a high-quality product at a price below the comparable national brand product. As a result, our business model results in consumers saving money on their self-care needs. 

We are dedicated to continuing to be the leader in developing and marketing new store brand products and have a research and development ("R&D") staff that we believe is one of the most experienced in the industry at developing products comparable in formulation and quality to national brand products. In order to offer consumers product features or benefits that national brand companies do not offer, we have recently implemented a product development strategy to differentiate store brand products from national brands. Our R&D team also responds to changes in existing national brand products by reformulating existing products. For example, in the OTC pharmaceutical market, certain new products are the result of changes in product status from Rx to OTC. These “Rx-to-OTC switches” require FDA approval through a process initiated by the drug innovator. The drug innovator usually begins the process by filing a New Drug Application ("NDA"), which is often followed by a competitor filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application ("ANDA"). New drugs are also marketed through the FDA's OTC monograph process, which allows us to produce drugs that are generally recognized as safe and effective without pre-marketing approval. In the oral self-care category, we focus on creating products that are equivalent to the national brands, and also partner with our customers to create exclusive brands and differentiated products. We rely on both internal R&D and strategic product development agreements with outside sources to develop new products.

The CSCA segment also develops, manufactures, and distributes certain branded products, which are consistent with the segment's self-care strategy. Branded products sold under brand names include Prevacid®24HR, Good Sense®, Zephrex D®, ScarAway®, Plackers®, and Rembrandt®.

We manufacture a significant portion of our CSCA segment's products at our plants located in the U.S., Mexico, China, and Israel, and we source the remaining product materials from third parties. In addition, in order to maximize both our capacity and sales of proprietary formulas, we engage in contract manufacturing, which involves producing unique ANDAs and monograph products through partnerships with major pharmaceutical and direct-to-consumer companies.

We believe the increasing age of the global population, continued rising healthcare costs, and consumers who proactively prevent or treat conditions will drive the need for the enhanced value that our products provide to consumers. In addition, we believe that new products and products switching from Rx to OTC status (as described above) will continue to drive growth within the segment.

Products

As we continue to transform to a consumer-focused, self-care company, we re-aligned our product categories as of December 31, 2019. The re-alignment standardizes our categories and product level detail to provide consistency across our consumer segments. This transformative step will optimize the way in which management reports and evaluates our business. Our CSCA segment offers products in the following categories:

Product Category Description

Pain and sleep-aids Products comprised of pain relievers, fever reducers and sleep-aids.

Upper respiratory Products that relieve upper respiratory symptoms, including cough suppressants, expectorants, and sinus relief.

Digestive health Products such as antacids, anti-diarrheal, and anti-heartburn that relieve symptoms associated with digestive issues.

Nutrition Infant formulas and nutritional beverages.

Healthy lifestyle Products that help consumers live a healthy lifestyle such as smoking cessation, diabetes care, and well-being products.

Skincare and personal hygiene Products for the face and body such as dermatological care, scar management, lice treatment, and other products for various skin conditions.

Oral self-care Products used for oral care, including toothbrushes, toothbrush replacement heads, floss, flossers, and whitening products.

Vitamins, minerals and supplements ("VMS") Vitamins, minerals, and supplements.

Other Diagnostic products and other miscellaneous self-care products.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

CSCA

The chart below reflects net sales by product category in the CSCA segment, which includes net sales from our OTC contract manufacturing business and our now-divested animal health business for the year ended December 31, 2019.

We launched several new CSCA products in the year ended December 31, 2019, most notably Loperamide Simethicone, Nicotine cherry ice mint mini lozenge, and a store brand infant formula launch at a major retailer. During the year ended December 31, 2019, new product sales in the CSCA segment were $36.2 million.

We, on our own or in conjunction with partners, received final FDA approval from U.S. health authorities for three new products within the CSCA segment in the year ended December 31, 2019, and as of December 31, 2019, we had three new product applications pending FDA approval.

Sales and Marketing

Our customers include major global, national, and regional retail drug, supermarket, and mass merchandise chains such as Walmart, Costco, CVS, Kroger, Target, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Dollar General, Sam’s Club, Topco, Rite Aid, and Amazon, and major wholesalers, including McKesson, Amerisource Bergen, and Cardinal Health.

We seek to establish customer loyalty through superior customer service by providing a comprehensive assortment of high quality, value-priced products; timely processing, shipment and delivery of orders; assistance in managing customer inventories; and support in managing and building the customer’s store brand business. The CSCA segment employs its own sales force to service larger customers and uses industry brokers for other customers. Field sales employees, with support from marketing and customer service, are assigned to specific customers in order to work most effectively with the customer. They assist customers by developing customized in-store marketing programs for customers' store brand products.

The primary objective of this store brand management approach is to enable our customers, retailers and wholesalers to increase sales and market share of their own store brand products by communicating store brand

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

CSCA

quality and value to the consumer and by inviting comparison to national brand products. Our sales and marketing personnel assist customers in the development and introduction of new store brand products and in the promotion of customers’ existing store brand products by providing market information; establishing individualized promotions and marketing programs, which may include floor displays, bonus sizes, coupons, rebates, store signs, and promotional packs; and performing consumer research. As e-commerce continues to grow as a consumer channel for our products, we have developed resources, programs and tools to be a strategic marketing partner for our customers’ digital marketing efforts.

In contrast with national brand manufacturers, which incur considerable advertising and marketing expenditures targeted directly to the end user or consumer, the CSCA segment’s store brand primary marketing efforts are channeled through retailers and wholesalers and reach the consumer through our customers’ in-store marketing programs and our digital media programs. Because the retail profit margin for store brand products is generally higher than for national brand products, retailers and wholesalers often commit funds for additional promotions.

In addition to in-store marketing programs, our nutrition category markets directly to consumers and healthcare professionals.

Competition

The markets for our self-care products are highly competitive and differ for each product line and geographic region. Our primary competitors include manufacturers, such as Dr. Reddy's Labs, LNK International, Inc., PL Developments and Aurobindo, and brand-name pharmaceutical and consumer product companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Bayer AG, GSK, Abbott Nutrition, Philips, and Reckitt Benckiser. The various major categories of our CSCA business each have certain key competitors, such that a competitor generally does not compete across all product lines. However, some competitors do have larger sales volumes in certain of our categories. Additionally, national brand companies tend to have more resources committed to marketing their products and could in the future manufacture store brand versions of their products at lower prices than their national brand products. Competition is based on a variety of factors, including price, quality, assortment of products, customer service, marketing support, and approvals for new products (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for additional information and risks associated with competition).

CONSUMER SELF-CARE INTERNATIONAL

Overview 

The CSCI segment is comprised of our branded consumer self-care business primarily in Europe and Australia, and our consumer-focused business in the United Kingdom and parts of Asia. This segment also includes our United Kingdom liquid licensed products business. The CSCI segment develops, manufactures, markets, and distributes many well-known European consumer self-care brands in the upper respiratory, pain and sleep-aids, digestive health, vitamins, minerals and supplements, healthy lifestyle, skincare and personal hygiene, and oral self-care categories. The segment leverages its broad regulatory, sales, and distribution infrastructure to in-license and sell third-party brands and generic pharmaceutical products. The CSCI segment distributes these products through an extensive network of customers including pharmacies, wholesalers, drug and grocery store retailers, and para-pharmacies in more than 30 countries, primarily in Europe. Many CSCI products have market leading positions in the markets in which they compete. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the CSCI segment represented approximately 29% of consolidated net sales.

Through continued investment in R&D partnerships and new technologies, the CSCI segment strives to offer high quality self-care products that meet consumers' needs. Internal R&D, new product development, insourcing, acquisitions, and partnerships support the new product pipeline, both in terms of brand extensions and product improvements. In the U.K., R&D focuses on oral liquid formulations for the branded Rx products for which liquid formulations are not available, as well as the development of store brand products and products for the branded business. Additional R&D centers are located in France, Sweden, Austria, Belgium, China, the U.K., Germany, and Hong Kong. In the rest of Europe, most R&D is performed by external partners with oversight by our teams. The segment has seven plants dedicated to manufacturing certain of its products.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

CSCI

The CSCI segment primarily focuses on building local and regional brands. In many markets outside of the U.S., a brand marketing strategy can be more effective than a store brand strategy due to the absence of mass merchandisers and large-scale pharmacy chains. Additionally, the inconsistent application of the centralized regulatory environment within Europe adds to the complexity of obtaining approvals for products in these markets.

While the CSCI segment sells over 200 brands, both on its own and through third parties, it focuses its resources on its "Focus brands", which are selected on the basis of their current sales and growth potential in the self-care market. Additional resources are allocated to these focus brands to strengthen their market position in high opportunity profit categories.

CSCI

We launched a number of new CSCI products in the year ended December 31, 2019, most notably XLS-Medical Forte 5, Phytosun® Aroms Organic essential oils, and ACO® brands in the healthy lifestyle, upper respiratory, and skincare and personal hygiene categories, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, new product sales in the CSCI segment were $108.0 million.

The CSCI segment has more than 150 strategic new products across all product categories in development, with each of its Focus brands having a five-year innovation master plan. 

Sales and Marketing

Our products, including products from the Ranir acquisition, are sold to customers including pharmacies, drug stores, and grocery stores located primarily in Europe, such as Walgreens Boots Alliance, McKesson, AS Watson, Tesco, ASDA-Walmart, DM, and Carrefour. The CSCI segment sells its products primarily through an established pharmacy sales force to an extensive network of individual pharmacists. Our sales representatives visit pharmacists frequently, ensuring strong in-store visibility of our brands and facilitating pharmacist education programs. Our sales, marketing, and regulatory teams use training/merchandising teams who work in conjunction with local sales representatives to improve our brands' presence and recognition. We seek to attract key talent from leading OTC, Fast Moving Consumer Goods ("FMCG"), and retailer companies to build strong local teams throughout the countries in which the CSCI segment operates. 

While CSCI products have a higher average gross margin than products sold in the CSCA segment, selling expenses are significantly higher due to the sales force mentioned above, as well as broadcast advertising and point-of-sale promotional spending to enhance brand equity. Key marketing communication tools for the CSCI segment include television and digital commercials, consumer leaflets, product websites, and targeted promotional campaigns.

Competition

The competitive landscape of the European consumer products market, in the categories in which we compete, is highly fragmented, as local companies often hold leadership positions in individual product segments in particular countries. As a result, the relevant competition in each of the CSCI segment's markets is both local and global. Competitors include GSK, Sanofi, Bayer, Johnson & Johnson, Reckitt Benckiser, Teva, Mylan, Stada, Novartis, Zentiva, and Procter & Gamble, as well as additional regional competitors. We believe our key advantage lies in our unique combination of best practices in sales, marketing, and product development (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for additional information and risks associated with competition).

PRESCRIPTION PHARMACEUTICALS

Overview

The RX segment develops, manufactures, and markets a portfolio of generic prescription drugs primarily for sale in the U.S. We define this portfolio as predominantly "extended topicals", as it encompasses a broad array of dosage forms such as creams, ointments, lotions, gels, shampoos, foams, suppositories, sprays, liquids, suspensions, and solutions. The portfolio also includes select controlled substances, injectables, hormones, oral solid dosage forms, and oral liquid formulations. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the RX segment represented approximately 20% of consolidated net sales.

In addition to extended topical products, which are the focus of our development efforts, our current development areas include other delivery systems such as oral liquids, metered dose inhalers, injectables, and transdermal products, some of which we are developing with third parties. Our other areas of expertise include our production capabilities for controlled substances and hormonal products. Our R&D efforts focus on complex formulations, many of which require costly or complex clinical trials.

We manufacture our topical and oral products in the U.S. and Israel, and also source from various FDA-approved third parties. RX products are manufactured, labeled, and packaged in facilities that comply with strict FDA regulatory standards.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

RX

We actively collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies to develop, manufacture, and market certain products or groups of products. These types of collaboration agreements are common in the pharmaceutical industry. We may choose to enter into these types of agreements to, among other things, leverage our or our collaborators' R&D and manufacturing expertise, or utilize our extensive marketing and distribution resources (refer to Item 8. Note 2 for more information regarding our method for recognizing revenue and expenses related to collaboration agreements, as well as Item 8. Note 18 for more information regarding our collaboration agreements).

Recent Trends and Developments

•Although pricing pressure is showing some signs of moderation, during 2019 we continued to experience a significant year-over-year reduction in pricing in our RX segment due to competitive pressure. We expect softness in pricing to continue to impact the segment for the foreseeable future.

•On February 24, 2020, along with our partner Catalent Pharma Solutions, we received approval from the FDA on our abbreviated new drug application for generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol, the first AB-rated generic version of ProAir® HFA. Shortly after approval, we launched with limited commercial quantities and anticipate that we will be in a position to provide a steady supply of this product by the fourth quarter of 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Contains the same active ingredients present in the same dosage form as the comparable brand-name drug

We launched a number of new RX products in the year ended December 31, 2019, most notably Acyclovir cream (generic equivalent to Zovirax® cream), Diclofenac Gel 1% (generic equivalent to Voltaren® Gel), Metronidazole Gel 0.75% (generic equivalent to MetroGel-Vaginal®), and relaunched the Scopolamine Patch. During the year ended December 31, 2019, new product sales in the RX segment were $86.3 million.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we, on our own or in collaboration with partners, received final approval from FDA health authorities for seven Rx drug applications, and as of December 31, 2019, we had 26 Rx drug applications pending approval.

Sales and Marketing

Our customers include sourcing groups such as Red Oak, WBAD and ClarusONE, major wholesalers, national and regional retail drug, supermarket and mass merchandise chains, hospitals, and pharmacies.

Competition

The market for RX products is subject to intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand-name pharmaceutical companies launching their own generic version of their branded products (known as an authorized generic), manufacturers of branded drug products that continue to produce those products after patent expirations, and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs. Among our generic drug manufacturer competitors are Sandoz Inc., Taro Pharmaceuticals, Mylan, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., Glenmark Generics Inc., Akorn, and Lupin.

We believe that one of our primary competitive advantages is our ability to introduce difficult to develop and/or manufacture topical generic versions to brand-name drug products. Generally, these products are exposed to less competition due to the more complex and expensive development, clinical trial, and approval processes. In addition, we believe we have a favorable competitive position due primarily to our efficient distribution systems, topical production economies of scale, customer service, and overall reputation for high quality products (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for more information and risks associated with competition).

INFORMATION APPLICABLE TO ALL REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

Trademarks, Patents and Licensing Agreements

While we own certain trademarks and patents, neither our business as a whole, nor any of our segments, is materially dependent upon our ownership of any one trademark, or patent, or group of trademarks or patents.

Materials Sourcing

Affordable, high-quality raw materials and packaging components are essential to all of our business units due to the nature of the products we manufacture. Raw materials and packaging components are generally available from multiple suppliers. Supplies of certain raw materials and product delivery systems may be more limited, as they are available from one or only a few suppliers and may require extensive compatibility testing before we can use them. We have been purchasing an increasing number of components and select finished goods rather than manufacturing them because of the availability of goods, economic reasons, temporary production limitations, FDA restrictions, sale of our API businesses, and other factors.

Historically, we have been able to react effectively, yet not always immediately, to situations that require alternate sourcing. Should such alternate sourcing be necessary, FDA requirements placed on products approved through the ANDA or NDA process could substantially lengthen the approval of an alternate source and adversely affect financial results. We believe we have good, cooperative working relationships with substantially all of our suppliers and have historically been able to capitalize on economies of scale in the purchase of materials and supplies due to our volume of purchases (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with materials sourcing).

Manufacturing and Distribution

Our primary manufacturing facilities are in the U.S. We also have manufacturing facilities in the U.K., Belgium, France, Germany, Austria, Israel, Mexico, China, and Australia, along with a joint venture in China (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with our manufacturing facilities). We supplement our production capabilities with the purchase of products from outside sources. The capacity of some facilities may be fully utilized at certain times for various reasons, such as customer demand, the seasonality of certain product categories, and new product launches. We may utilize available capacity by performing contract manufacturing for other companies. We have logistics facilities in the U.S., Israel, Mexico, Australia, and numerous locations throughout Europe. We use contract freight and common carriers to deliver our products.

Significant Customers 

Our primary customer base aligns with the concentration of large drug retailers in the current global retail drug industry marketplace. Walmart is our largest customer and accounted for the following percentage of consolidated net sales:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 Sales to Walmart are primarily in the CSCA segment. In addition, while no other customer individually comprises more than 10% of net sales, we do have other significant customers. The next five largest customers represent 25% of net sales in 2019. The loss of several of these customers could be material. We believe we generally have good relationships with all our customers (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks associated with customers).

Environmental

Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations. We undergo periodic internal audits relating to environmental, health and safety requirements in order to maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We have made, and continue to make, expenditures necessary to comply with applicable environmental laws; however, we do not believe that the costs for complying with such laws and regulations have been or will be material to our business. We do not have any material remediation liabilities outstanding.

While we believe that climate change could present risks to our business, including increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements, physical risks to our facilities, water limitations, and disruptions to our supply chain, we do not believe these risks are material to our business in the near term. 

Corporate Social Responsibility

We are committed to doing business in an ethical manner. We have a long history of environmentally sound and efficient operations, safe and healthy working conditions, and active participation in the communities where we are located. As reflected in our Corporate Social Responsibility ("CSR") Report available on our website, we remain committed to:

•Providing "Quality, Affordable Self-Care Products™";

•Environmental stewardship;

•Employee diversity, health and well-being;

•Community engagement; and

•Human rights.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICING

The manufacturing, processing, formulation, packaging, labeling, testing, storing, distributing, advertising, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by a variety of agencies in the localities in which our products are sold. In addition, we manufacture and market certain of our products in accordance with standards set by various organizations. We believe that our policies, operations, and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which we are subject (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for related risks).

United States Regulation

U.S. Food and Drug Administration

The FDA has jurisdiction over our Rx, OTC drug products, API, and Infant Formula. The FDA’s jurisdiction extends to the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of these products. We are committed to consistently providing our customers with high quality products that adhere to "current Good Manufacturing Practices" ("cGMP") regulations promulgated by the FDA.

OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 

All facilities where Rx and OTC products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, or distributed for the U.S. market must comply with FDA cGMPs and regulations promulgated by competent authorities in the countries, states and localities where the facilities are located. All of our drug products are manufactured, tested, packaged, stored, and distributed according to cGMP regulations. The FDA performs periodic audits to ensure that our facilities remain in compliance with all appropriate regulations. 

Many of our OTC products are regulated under the OTC monograph system and subject to certain FDA regulations. Under this system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. Products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula, and labeling requirements, including permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients, and dosage levels. It is generally less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. 

 16

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

 We also market generic prescription drugs and non-prescription products that have switched from prescription to OTC status. Prior to commercial marketing, these products require approval by the FDA of an ANDA or NDA that provides information on chemistry, manufacturing controls, clinical safety, efficacy and/or bioequivalence, packaging, and labeling. While the development process for these drugs generally requires less time and expense than the development process of a new drug, the size and duration of required studies can vary greatly. Prior to the onset of the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (“GDUFA”), the FDA approval of generic drug applications took approximately three to five times longer than approval of innovator drugs. Pursuant to GDUFA II, beginning October 1, 2017, year five of the program, the FDA pledged to complete a first cycle review on 90% of electronic generic applications within 10 months of submission.

Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, as amended ("FFDCA") (the Hatch-Waxman amendments), a company submitting an NDA can obtain a three-year period of marketing exclusivity for a prescription or OTC product if it performs a clinical study that is essential to FDA approval. Longer periods of exclusivity are possible for new chemical entities, orphan drugs (those designated under section 526 of the FFDCA) and drugs under the Generating Antibiotic Incentives Now Act. During this exclusivity period, the FDA cannot approve any ANDAs for a similar or equivalent generic product, which can preclude another party from marketing a similar product during this period. A company may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if it conducts pediatric studies requested by the FDA on the product. This exclusivity can delay both the FDA approval and sales of certain products.

A company may be entitled to a 180-day generic exclusivity period for certain products. This exclusivity period often follows a patent certification and litigation process whereby the product innovator may sue for infringement. The legal action does not ordinarily result in material damages, but it generally triggers a statutorily mandated delay in FDA approval of the ANDA for a period of up to 30 months from when the innovator was notified of the patent challenge. 

The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act ("FDASIA") was signed into law on July 9, 2012. The law established, among other things, new user fee statutes for generic drugs and biosimilars, FDA authority concerning drug shortages, changes to enhance the FDA's inspection authority of the drug supply chain, and a limited extension of the 30-month stay provision described above. The FDASIA also reduced the time required for FDA responses to generic-blocking citizen petitions. We implemented new systems and processes to comply with the new facility self-identification and user fee requirements of the FDASIA, and we monitor facility self-identification and fee payment compliance to mitigate the risk of potential supply chain interruptions or delays in regulatory approval of new applications.

The U.S. government's Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period. The serialization of all Rx products distributed in the U.S. needed to be completed by November 26, 2018, with the requirement for tracking the products commencing on November 27, 2023. Requirements for the tracing of products at the lot level through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain went into effect on January 1, 2015 for manufacturers, wholesale distributors, and re-packagers, and on July 1, 2015 for dispensers. 

The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 created a pathway by which the FDA may, at the request of an applicant, designate a drug with “inadequate generic competition” as a Competitive Generic Therapy ("CGT"). At the request of the applicant, the FDA may expedite the development and review of an ANDA for a drug designated as a CGT. The first approved application for a drug with a CGT designation for which there are no unexpired patents or exclusivities listed in the Orange Book at the time of original submission of the ANDA may be eligible for 180 days of generic exclusivity.

Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients

Third parties develop and manufacture APIs for use in certain of our pharmaceutical products that are sold in the U.S. and other global markets. API manufacturers typically submit a drug master file to the regulatory authority that provides the proprietary information related to the manufacturing process. The FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance, and the facilities and procedures must be cGMP compliant 

 17

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

before API may be exported to the U.S. 

Infant Formula

The FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition is responsible for the regulation of infant formula. The Office of Nutrition, Labeling and Dietary Supplements ("ONLDS") has labeling responsibility for infant formula, while the Office of Food Additive Safety ("OFAS") has program responsibility for food ingredients and packaging. The ONLDS evaluates whether an infant formula manufacturer has met the requirements under the FFDCA and consults with the OFAS regarding the safety of ingredients in infant formula and of packaging materials for infant formula.

All manufacturers of pediatric nutrition products must begin with safe food ingredients, which are either generally recognized as safe or approved as food additives. The Infant Formula Act provides specific requirements for infant formula to ensure the safety and nutrition of infant formulas, including minimum and, in some cases, maximum levels of specified nutrients.

Before marketing a particular infant formula, the manufacturer must provide regulatory agencies assurance of the nutritional quality of that particular formulation consistent with the FDA’s labeling, nutrient content, and manufacturer quality control requirements. A manufacturer must notify the FDA at least 90 days before the marketing of any infant formula that differs fundamentally in processing or in composition from any previous formulation produced by the manufacturer. We actively monitor this process and make the appropriate adjustments to remain in compliance with recent FDA rules regarding cGMP, quality control procedures, quality factors, notification requirements, and reports and records for the production of infant formulas.

In addition, the FFDCA requires infant formula manufacturers to test product composition during production and shelf-life; to keep records on production, testing, and distribution of each batch of infant formula; to use cGMP and quality control procedures; and to maintain records of all complaints and adverse events, some of which may reveal the possible existence of a health hazard. The FDA conducts yearly inspections of all facilities that manufacture infant formula, inspects new facilities during early production runs, and collects and analyzes samples of infant formula. Our infant formula manufacturing facilities have been inspected by the FDA with no corrective actions required.

Our infant and toddler foods are subject to the Food Safety Modernization Act ("FSMA"), which protects the safety of U.S. foods by mandating comprehensive, prevention-based controls within the food industry. Under FSMA, the FDA has mandatory recall authority for all food products and greater authority to inspect food producers and is taking steps toward product tracing to enable more efficient product source identification in the event of a safety issue.

U.S. Department of Agriculture

The Organic Foods Production Act enacted under Title 21 of the 1990 Farm Bill established uniform national standards for the production and handling of foods labeled as "organic." Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio adhere to the standards of the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") National Organic Program for production, handling, and processing to maintain the integrity of organic products. Our infant formula manufacturing sites in Vermont and Ohio are USDA-certified, enabling them to produce and label organic products for U.S. and Canadian markets.

U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") is the main regulatory body in the United States governing environmental regulation. Laws administered by the EPA, often in partnership with state agencies, include but are not limited to the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act; the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA") regulates certain drug products containing controlled substances, such as morphine, hydromorphone, opium, testosterone, midazolam, and List I chemicals, such as pseudoephedrine, pursuant to the federal Controlled Substances Act ("CSA"). The CSA and DEA regulations impose registration, security, record keeping, reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, importation and other requirements upon legitimate handlers under the oversight of the DEA. The DEA categorizes controlled substances into Schedules I, II, III, IV, or V, with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. We are subject to the requirements regarding the controlled substances in Schedules II - V and the List I chemicals. Our facilities that manufacture, distribute, import, or export any controlled substances must register annually with the DEA.

The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting, and handling prior to issuing a controlled substance registration, and it also periodically inspects facilities for compliance with the CSA and its regulations. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action, such as civil penalties, refusal to renew necessary registration, or the initiation of proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution. We are also subject to state laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of certain products.

Federal Healthcare Programs and Drug Pricing Regulation

Within the U.S., government healthcare insurance and welfare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs are important third party payers for patients who take our products. These programs include several indirect forms of price regulation applicable to our drug products as a condition for coverage and/or payment for our products and also regulate the amount that pharmacies and other healthcare providers will be paid for our products. Specifically, U.S. law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having federal funds being made available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, enter into three government pricing program agreements: (i) a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program; (ii) a 340B program agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide discounts to certain “covered entity” safety net healthcare providers; and (iii) a Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs (the "VA") under which discounts are available for purchases by federal agencies. We have such agreements in effect. 

Medicaid Rebate Agreement

The Medicaid rebate agreement requires the drug manufacturer to remit rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis for both fee-for-service and Medicaid managed care organization utilization. Rebate amounts are based on pricing data reported by the manufacturer to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), including Average Manufacturer Price ("AMP") and, in the case of innovator products, Best Price ("BP"). U.S. law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program report average sales price ("ASP") information to CMS for each calendar quarter for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B.

Under the Medicaid rebate program, the minimum rebate amounts due are as follows: (i) for noninnovator products, in general generic drugs marketed under ANDAs, the rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter; and (ii) for innovator products, in general brand-name products marketed under NDAs, the rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the AMP for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the BP for that same quarter. Manufacturers also pay an “additional rebate" on both innovator and noninnovator drugs where price increases since launch have outpaced inflation. Beginning with the first quarter of 2017, an additional rebate is due for noninnovator products, which is calculated somewhat differently from the innovator product additional rebate, but likewise generally applies where and to the extent that a manufacturer’s AMP increases faster than the rate of inflation.

CMS issued a final regulation, generally effective April 1, 2016, to implement changes to the Medicaid rebate program under the 2010 health reform legislation (“Health Reform Law”) and otherwise to provide program guidance. In addition to guidance concerning rebate program administration matters, the regulation also addressed 

 19

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

certain related Medicaid reimbursement matters. First, under the Health Reform Law, CMS has also begun to use manufacturer AMP data to calculate reimbursement limits for pharmacies for multiple source drugs under the Medicaid program, known as the federal upper limits ("FULs"). CMS also surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis for comparing their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. Second, the regulation also directed states to update their Medicaid payment methodologies to provide for payment amounts designed to reflect pharmacies’ "actual acquisition costs" for drugs, a change from the prior "estimated acquisition" standard. The regulation also required states to provide the government with findings to support their compliance with this standard by April 1, 2017. 

Pricing and rebate calculations are governed by statutory and regulatory requirements that are complex, vary among products and programs, can change over time, and are subject to interpretation by us, governmental or regulatory agencies, and the courts. In the case of the Medicaid rebate program, if we become aware of errors in our prior price submissions, or a prior BP submission needs to be updated due to late arriving data, we must resubmit the updated data within specified time frames. Such restatements and recalculations increase our cost of compliance with the Medicaid rebate program, and corrections can result in an overage or underage of our rebate liability for past quarters, depending on the nature of the correction.

340B Program Agreement

The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The ceiling price is derived from the data the manufacturer reports under the Medicaid rebate program and therefore any changes to statutory or regulatory requirements applicable to the Medicaid price figures may impact the 340B ceiling price calculation as well. 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as certain hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. 

Master Agreement with the Department of Veterans Affairs

U.S. law also requires any company that participates in the Medicaid rebate program and Medicare Part B and that wants its covered drugs paid for by certain federal agencies and grantees to enter into a Master Agreement with the VA. Under the Master Agreement, the company must offer its prescription innovator drugs for procurement under the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) contracting program, and must charge certain agencies (the VA, Department of Defense, Public Health Service and Coast Guard) no more than a statutory Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”). The FCP is calculated based on Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price data we submit to the VA. FSS contracts include extensive disclosure and certification requirements and standard government terms and conditions with which we must comply. Products sold to the government under an FSS contract must comply with the requirements of the Trade Agreements regarding the allowable countries where a product is manufactured or “substantially transformed". Consistent with the VA’s interpretation of the Master Agreement, we have also entered into an agreement to pay rebates on innovator drug prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.

Medicare Part D “Coverage Gap” Rebates

For certain innovator products, manufacturers must also enter into an agreement with the Secretary of HHS to provide rebates with respect to utilization of their products by certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries while those patients are within the Medicare Part D benefit “coverage gap.” Manufacturers are not required to submit separate pricing data under this program; the rebate amount is calculated by CMS based on Part D plans’ “negotiated prices” paid to pharmacies.

Other Price Regulation and State Regulation

In addition to these technical government pricing regulation programs, drug pricing has come under increasing public scrutiny arising out of general concerns about high drug costs or price increases, and transparency of pricing and discounting practices within the pharmaceutical distribution system. Congress is considering various amendments to federal drug pricing laws, as well as new forms of pricing regulation. Several states have enacted laws that, among other things, require manufacturers to report information concerning 

 20

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

pharmaceutical pricing or marketing practices or to provide advance notice of price actions or applications for regulatory approvals to certain entities (refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors - Operational Risks for risks related to the above-mentioned programs). 

Other U.S. Regulations and Organizations

We are subject to various other federal, state, non-governmental, and local agency rules and regulations. Compliance with the laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of our current products and the discovery, development, and introduction of new products requires substantial effort, expense and capital investment. Other regulatory agencies, organizations, legislation, regulations and laws that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

•Physician Payment Sunshine Act and Similar State Laws - This act and similar state laws require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, maintenance of a payment database and public reporting of the payment data.

•Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA") - This act and other similar anti-bribery laws prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage.

•Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") - This agency oversees the advertising and other promotional practices of consumer products marketers. The FTC considers whether a product’s claims are substantiated, truthful and not misleading. The FTC also reviews mergers and acquisitions of companies exceeding specified thresholds and investigates certain business practices relevant to the healthcare industry. 

•International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") - The ISO Standards specify requirements for a Quality Management System that demonstrates the ability to consistently provide products that meet customer and applicable regulatory standards and includes processes to ensure continuous improvement. Our infant formula manufacturing sites are ISO 9001-2008 Certified for Quality Management Systems. ISO inspections are conducted at least annually.

•United States Pharmacopeial Convention, Inc. ("USP") - The USP is a non-governmental, standard-setting organization. By reference, the FFDCA incorporates the USP quality and testing standards and monographs as the standard that must be met for the listed drugs, unless compliance with those standards is specifically disclaimed on the product’s labeling. USP standards exist for most Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals and many nutritional supplements. The FDA typically requires USP compliance as part of cGMP compliance.

•Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ("HIPAA") - HIPAA is a set of regulations designed to protect personal information and data collected and stored in medical records. It established a national standard to be used in all doctors' offices, hospitals and other businesses where personal medical information is stored. In addition to protecting personal medical information, HIPAA also gives patients the right to view their medical records and request changes if the data is incorrect. We could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA or for aiding and abetting the violation of HIPAA.

•Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") - The CPSC has published regulations requiring child resistant packaging on certain products including pharmaceuticals and dietary supplements. The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements. 

•California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act ("Prop 65") - Prop 65 is a toxic right-to-know warnings law that allows the state attorney general and private enforcers to sue on behalf of the public claiming the products in question sold in California violate the law by exposing consumers to chemicals in levels above those allowed by regulation without carrying warnings.

 21

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

•Other State Agencies - We are subject to regulation by numerous other state health departments, insurance departments, boards of pharmacy, state controlled substance agencies, state consumer health and safety regulations, and other comparable state agencies, each of which have license requirements and fees that vary by state.

Regulation Outside the U.S.

We develop and manufacture products and market third-party manufactured products in regions outside the U.S., including Europe, Israel, Canada, Mexico, Australia, countries in Asia, South America, and the Middle East, each of which has its own regulatory environment. The majority of our sales outside the U.S. are in the following categories: OTC/Rx pharmaceuticals, infant formulas, medical devices, dietary supplements, cosmetics, and oral self-care products. Other regulatory agencies, organizations and legislation that may impact our business include, but are not limited to: 

•Privacy Regulations - We are subject to numerous global laws and regulations designed to protect personal data, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). The GDPR introduced more stringent data protection requirements in the EU, as well as substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules. The GDPR increased our responsibility and potential liability in relation to personal data that we process, and we have put in place additional mechanisms to comply with the GDPR.

•Transparency Laws - In various jurisdictions in which we operate, we are subject to the laws and regulations aimed at increasing transparency of financial relationships between healthcare professionals and pharmaceutical/medical device manufacturers. These acts require certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.

•Anti-Bribery Laws - Various jurisdictions in which we operate have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and the Irish Criminal Justice (Corruption Offenses) Act 2018, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. 

•Rules and Regulations Infant Formula - Outside of the U.S., country-specific regulations define the requirements that we must comply with regarding the manufacturing, testing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, and promotion of infant formula. We are subject to ongoing periodic inspection through these complex regulations, including by the FDA and other regulatory agencies such as the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ("CFIA").

European Union

OTC and Rx Pharmaceuticals 

The European pharmaceutical industry is highly regulated and much of the legislative and regulatory framework is driven by the European Parliament and the European Commission. This has many benefits, including the potential to harmonize standards across the complex European market. However, obtaining regulatory agreement across member states presents complex challenges that can lead to delays in the regulatory process. 

In the EU, as well as many other locations around the world, the manufacture and sale of medicinal products are regulated in a manner substantially similar to that of the U.S. requirements, which generally prohibit the handling, manufacture, marketing, and importation of any medicinal product unless it is properly registered in accordance with applicable law. The registration file relating to any particular product must contain data related to product efficacy and safety, including results of clinical testing and/or references to medical publications, as well as detailed information regarding production methods and quality control. Health ministries are authorized to cancel the registration of a product if it is found to be harmful or ineffective or if it is manufactured or marketed other than in accordance with registration conditions.

Between 1995 and 1998, the over-arching regulation that governs medicinal products was revised in an attempt to simplify and harmonize product registration. This revised legislation introduced the mutual recognition procedure (“MRP”), whereby after approval of a marketing authorization by regulatory authorities in the reference 

 22

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

member state (“RMS”), additional marketing authorizations could be submitted to other concerned member states to obtain a product license. In November 2005, the medicinal product legislation was further revised to introduce the decentralized procedure (“DCP”), whereby marketing authorizations are submitted simultaneously to the RMS and select concerned member states. In 2005, the EMA also opened up the centralized procedure to sponsors of marketing authorizations for generic medicinal products. Unlike the MRP and DCP, the centralized procedure results in a single marketing authorization and product labeling across all member states that will allow a sponsor to file for individual country reimbursement and make the medicine available in all the EU countries listed on the application. Marketing authorizations and subsequent product licenses are granted to applicants only after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. 

In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer’s facilities obtain approval from an EU Regulatory Authority. The EU has a code of GMP that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. We believe that our policies, operations and products comply in all material respects with existing regulations to which our operations are subject.

In 2011, it was first proposed that the EU Member States had to transition to the European Falsified Medicines Directive (the “Directive”). The Directive was subsequently written into national law on January 2, 2013. The Directive made reference to a Delegated Act (the Delegated Act lists the detailed requirements for manufacturers). The Delegated Act was finalized and published in February 2017, and it provided for a two-year implementation period. As of February 2019, we are in compliance with the Delegated Act. The provisions of the Directive are intended to reduce the risk of counterfeit medicines entering the supply chain and also to ensure the quality of API manufactured outside of the EU. The Directive required the serialization of all Rx and some OTC products, similar to the DSCSA in the U.S.

In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of prescription medicinal products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing for generics; generally, “tendering” refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the government by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, suppliers of a product in a particular country.

Data exclusivity provisions exist in many countries, although the application is not uniform. In general, these exclusivity provisions prevent the approval and/or submission of generic drug applications to the health authorities for a fixed period of time following the first approval of the brand-name product in that country. As these exclusivity provisions operate independently of patent exclusivity, they may prevent the submission of generic drug applications for some products even after the patent protection has expired.

The requirements deriving from European pharmacovigilance regulation are constantly expanding due to increasing guidance on good vigilance practices and increased communication on inspectors’ expectations. Pharmacovigilance fee regulation became effective in late 2014 to support health authority assessment of pharmacovigilance safety evaluation reports, study protocols for post authorization safety studies and referrals. Once approved, the advertising of pharmaceuticals in the EU is governed by national regulations and guidelines. Within certain member states this is overseen by a self-certification process whereas in others national governance bodies approve material prior to release.

The wholesale distribution of medicinal products is an important activity in the integrated supply chain management. The quality and the integrity of medicinal products can be affected by a lack of adequate control. To this end, the EU Commission has published guidelines on Good Distribution Practice of Medicinal Products for Human Use in 2013. The present guidelines are based on Articles 84 and 85b(3) of medicinal products for human use directive. 

Medical Devices

The EU has enacted into law numerous directives and adopted many harmonizing standards pertaining to a wide range of industrial products, including medical devices. Medical devices that comply with the requirements of 

 23

Perrigo Company plc - Item 1

Regulation

applicable directives are entitled to bear the CE marking of conformity, which indicates that the device conforms to the applicable requirements of the directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an organization accredited by a member state. Assessment by a Notified Body includes an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and may also include specific testing of the product. This assessment is a prerequisite for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the EU. On May 25, 2017, the EU’s Medical Device Regulation (the “MDR”) became effective, with a three year transitional period until full application. All Class I (low risk) medical devices need to comply with the MDR by May 26, 2020, and all medical devices sold in the EU will need to be approved under the MDR by May 26, 2024. Notified Bodies, which are organizations accredited by a member state, can continue to approve medical devices under the existing Medical Device Directives (the “MDDs”) until May 26, 2020. Beginning on May 27, 2020, Notified Bodies will no longer be able to approve new medical devices under the MDDs or approve notifications of “substantial” design changes, including changes to labeling/packaging, changes to the manufacturing process, or the addition of new features and functionality, to medical devices that were approved under the MDDs. 

Dietary Supplements 

Dietary supplements are subject to several regulations that inform the selection of ingredient levels and how products can be described on packaging and in advertising. These regulations include: Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC, Food Information to Consumers Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011, Permitted Vitamins and Minerals Regulation (EC) 1170/2009, Food Additives Regulation (EC) 1333/2008, Nutritional & Health Claims Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006, the Foods Intended for Particular Nutritional Uses Directive 2009/39/EC, and Regulation (EU) 609/2013.

EU rules on nutrition and health claims, which were established by Regulation EC 1924/2006, apply to any nutritional or health claim by a manufacturer. The objective of the regulation is to ensure that claims made in food labeling or advertising are clear, accurate and based on scientific evidence. The European Food Safety Authority, an advisory panel to the European Commission, performs all scientific assessments of health claims on food and supplement labels. An EU register of nutrition and health claims exists to document approved, pending, and rejected claims. 

Cosmetics

Cosmetic products in the EU market must comply with Regulation EC No. 1223/2009. This regulation requires manufacturers to prepare a product safety report prior to placing a cosmetic product in the market. In addition, for each cosmetic product placed in the market, a “responsible person” must be designated to oversee compliance with the regulation’s reporting requirements. Commission Regulation EU No. 655/2013 establishes the common criteria and justification for claims to be used in the packaging and advertising of cosmetics products.

General Product Safety Directive

The General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC) complements sector-specific legislation such as rules that apply to electrical and electronic goods, chemicals, and other specific product groups. Together, the General Product Safety Directive and sector specific legislation ensure the safety and traceability of products in the market (other than pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and food which are regulated under separate legislation). If our products fail to meet the General Product Safety Directive, we may incur fines.

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 11,200 full-time and temporary employees worldwide, of which approximately 18% were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations generally good.
