Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

We are a global provider of high technology products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries. Our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into four principal business segments: Otis, Carrier, Pratt & Whitney, and Collins Aerospace Systems. Otis and Carrier are referred to as the "commercial businesses," while Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems are referred to as the "aerospace businesses." 

On June 9, 2019, UTC entered into a merger agreement with Raytheon Company (Raytheon) providing for an all-stock merger of equals transaction. The Raytheon merger agreement provides, among other things, that each share of Raytheon common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Raytheon merger (except for shares held by Raytheon as treasury stock) will be converted into the right to receive 2.3348 shares of UTC common stock. Upon the closing of the Raytheon merger, Raytheon will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of UTC, and UTC will change its name to Raytheon Technologies Corporation. On October 11, 2019, the shareowners of each of UTC and Raytheon approved the proposals necessary to complete the Raytheon merger. The Raytheon merger is expected to close early in the second quarter of 2020 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approvals, as well as the completion of UTC's separation of its Otis and Carrier businesses.

As has been previously disclosed, in November 2018, the Company announced its intention to separate into three independent companies. The separation will result in three global, industry-leading companies: 

United Technologies, comprised of Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney, will be the preeminent systems supplier to the aerospace and defense industry; 

•Otis, the world's leading manufacturer of elevators, escalators and moving walkways; and

•Carrier, a global provider of HVAC, refrigeration, building automation, fire safety and security products with leadership positions across its portfolio.

The proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs of Otis and Carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and are expected to be completed early in the second quarter of 2020. Separation of Otis and Carrier from UTC via spin-off transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings and a tax opinion from external counsel, the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements, and satisfactory completion of financing (subject to UTC’s agreement to consummate the distributions pursuant to, and subject to the terms and conditions of, the Raytheon merger agreement discussed below).

 On November 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins (the "Rockwell Acquisition"), a leader in aviation and high-integrity solutions for commercial and military customers as well as leading-edge avionics, flight controls, aircraft interior and data connectivity solutions. The total aggregate consideration payable in the Rockwell Acquisition was $15.5 billion in cash ($14.9 billion net of cash acquired) and 62.2 million shares of Company common stock. In addition, $7.8 billion of Rockwell Collins debt was outstanding at the time of the Rockwell Acquisition. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the Rockwell Acquisition. 

The commercial businesses generally serve customers in the worldwide commercial and residential property industries, with Carrier also serving customers in the commercial and transport refrigeration industries. The aerospace businesses serve commercial and government aerospace customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets. Our consolidated net sales were derived from the commercial and aerospace businesses as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our consolidated net sales were derived from original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and aftermarket parts and services as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic and political factors on both a regional and global level. Our operations include original equipment manufacturing and extensive related aftermarket parts and services in both our

commercial and aerospace businesses. Our business mix also reflects the combination of shorter cycles at Carrier and in our commercial aerospace spares businesses, and longer cycles at Otis and in our aerospace OEM and aftermarket maintenance businesses. Our customers are in both the public and private sectors, and our businesses reflect an extensive geographic diversification that has evolved with continued globalization. Refer to Note 20 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of sales attributed to geographic regions.

As part of our growth strategy, we invest in businesses in certain countries that carry high levels of currency, political and/or economic risk, such as Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Poland, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, Ukraine and countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. As of December 31, 2019, the net assets in any one of these countries did not exceed 5% of consolidated shareowners' equity.

In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom (the U.K.) voted in favor of the U.K.'s exiting the European Union (the EU). The manner in which the U.K. decides to exit the EU could have negative macroeconomic consequences. Our 2019 full year sales in and from the U.K. were approximately $4 billion and represented less than 5% of our overall sales, and we do not believe the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU will significantly impact our businesses in the near term.

Organic sales growth was 5% in 2019, reflecting growth across all segments driven by:

•Higher sales across all channels at Pratt & Whitney;

•Higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales at Collins Aerospace Systems; 

•Higher service sales across all regions and higher new equipment sales driven by growth in Asia at Otis;

•Higher commercial and residential HVAC sales at Carrier.

We continue to invest in new platforms and new markets to position the Company for long-term growth, while remaining focused on innovation, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation and execution to meet or exceed customer and shareowner commitments. 

As discussed below in "Results of Operations," operating profit in both 2019 and 2018 includes the impact from activities that are not expected to recur often or that are not otherwise reflective of the underlying operations, such as the beneficial impact of net gains from sales of investments, the unfavorable impact of contract matters with customers, transaction, acquisition and integration costs, costs associated with the Company's intention to separate its commercial businesses, and other significant non-recurring and non-operational items. Our earnings growth strategy contemplates earnings from organic sales growth, including growth from new product development and product improvements, structural cost reductions, operational improvements, and incremental earnings from our investments in acquisitions.

 In total, our investments in businesses in 2019 and 2018 totaled $56 million and $31,142 million, (including debt assumed of $7,784 million and stock issued of $7,960 million) respectively. Our investments in businesses in 2019 included a number of small acquisitions primarily at Otis. In addition to Rockwell Collins, acquisitions completed in 2018 primarily include an acquisition at Carrier and at Pratt & Whitney.

Both acquisition and restructuring costs associated with business combinations are expensed as incurred. Depending on the nature and level of acquisition activity, earnings could be adversely impacted due to acquisition and restructuring actions initiated in connection with the integration of businesses acquired. For additional discussion of acquisitions and restructuring, see "Liquidity and Financial Condition," "Restructuring Costs" and Notes 2 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The factors contributing to the total percentage change year-over-year in total net sales are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All four segments experienced organic sales growth during 2019. Pratt & Whitney sales grew 8% organically, reflecting higher military, commercial OEM, and commercial aftermarket sales. Collins Aerospace Systems grew 6% organically, driven by higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM sales. Organic sales growth of 5% at Otis reflects higher service sales, driven by broad-based growth across all regions, and higher new equipment sales driven by growth in Asia. Carrier sales grew 1% organically, driven by higher commercial and residential HVAC sales. The 12% increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net primarily reflects the increase in sales attributed to the Rockwell Acquisition.

All four segments experienced organic sales growth during 2018. Pratt & Whitney sales grew 14% organically, reflecting higher commercial aftermarket, commercial OEM, and military sales. Collins Aerospace Systems grew 8% organically, driven by higher commercial aftermarket and military sales, and higher commercial OEM sales. Organic sales growth of 6% at Carrier was driven by growth in North America residential HVAC, global commercial HVAC, and transport refrigeration sales. Otis sales grew 3% organically, reflecting higher service sales in North America and Asia, and higher new equipment sales in Europe, Asia excluding China, and North America, partially offset by a decline in China.

Cost of Products and Services Sold 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The factors contributing to the total percentage change year-over-year in total cost of products and services sold are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The organic increase in total cost of products and services sold in 2019 was primarily driven by the organic sales increases noted above. The 11% increase in Acquisitions and divestitures, net primarily reflects the increase in cost of products and services sold attributed to the Rockwell Acquisition. The 1% decline in Other primarily reflects the absence of a prior year customer contract settlement at Pratt & Whitney (1%).

The organic increase in total cost of products and services sold in 2018 was primarily driven by the organic sales increases noted above. The 2% increase in Other primarily reflects the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard (1%) and a customer contract settlement at Pratt & Whitney (1%), partially offset by the absence of a prior year customer contract matter at Pratt & Whitney.

4

Gross Margin

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 110 basis point increase in gross margin as a percentage of sales in 2019, includes a 230 basis point increase at Collins Aerospace Systems driven by higher commercial aftermarket volumes and cost reduction, partially offset by adverse commercial OEM mix. Pratt & Whitney's gross margin increased 120 basis points primarily reflecting continued year-over-year cost reduction and favorable mix on large commercial engine shipments. Gross margin at Otis increased 30 basis points largely driven by favorable service contribution. These increases were partially offset by a 30 basis point decline in Carrier's gross margin primarily driven by unfavorable mix, the absence of a favorable prior year contract adjustment related to a large commercial project at Carrier, and the unfavorable year-over-year impact resulting from the revaluation of certain long-term liabilities.

The 130 basis point decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in 2018, includes a 300 basis point decline in Pratt & Whitney's gross margin driven by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of customer contract matters and higher negative engine margin from higher engine deliveries. Collins Aerospace Systems' gross margin declined 40 basis points as the benefits of higher commercial aftermarket volumes and cost reduction were more than offset by adverse commercial OEM and military OEM mix, and higher warranty expense. Gross margin at Otis declined 140 basis points largely driven by unfavorable price and mix, primarily in China. These declines were partially offset by a 40 basis point increase in Carrier's gross margin as favorable pricing and the favorable year-over-year impact of contract adjustments related to a large commercial project and a prior year product recall program were partially offset by increased commodities and logistics costs. 

Research and Development

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Research and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year variations in spending levels are expected. The majority of the company-funded spending is incurred by the aerospace businesses and relates largely to the next generation engine product family at Pratt & Whitney and systems being developed to support new aircraft and other program introductions at Collins Aerospace Systems. In 2019, company-funded research and development increased 22% over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by the impact of the Rockwell Acquisition (18%). Excluding this impact, an increase in company-funded research and development at Collins Aerospace Systems (3%) was driven by higher spend across various commercial programs. Company-funded research and development expense at Pratt & Whitney also increased (2%) driven by higher spend across various commercial programs partially offset by a decline in military program spend.

Customer-funded research and development increased 50% over the prior year, primarily reflecting the impact of the Rockwell Acquisition (53%). Excluding this impact, customer-funded research and development declined year-over-year as a decrease at Pratt & Whitney (4%), primarily driven by lower research and development expenses on military development programs, was partially offset by an increase at Collins Aerospace Systems (2%), primarily driven by higher expenses on various military development programs.

In 2018, company-funded research and development increased 1% over the prior year. This increase was primarily driven by Collins Aerospace Systems (1%) as higher spend across various commercial programs was largely offset by the deferral of certain development costs as contract fulfillment costs in accordance with the New Revenue Standard. Company-funded research and development expense at Pratt & Whitney was consistent with the prior year.

Customer-funded research and development in 2018 was consistent with 2017, as a decrease at Collins Aerospace Systems, primarily driven by the deferral of certain development costs as contract fulfillment costs in accordance with the New Revenue Standard, was offset by an increase at Pratt & Whitney, primarily driven by higher research and development expenses on military development programs. 

5

Selling, General and Administrative

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 21% in 2019. This increase primarily reflects the impact of incremental selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the Rockwell Acquisition (9%), costs associated with the Company's intention to separate its commercial businesses (8%), and costs associated with the Raytheon merger (1%). In addition, 2019 reflects higher expenses at Pratt & Whitney (1%) driven by increased headcount and employee compensation related expenses and costs to support higher volumes as well as higher restructuring costs; higher expenses at Collins Aerospace Systems (1%) primarily driven by increased headcount and employee compensation related expenses partially offset by synergy capture related to the Rockwell Acquisition; higher expenses at Otis (1%) resulting from higher labor and information technology cost; and an increase at Carrier (1%) primarily driven by higher costs related to productivity initiatives and higher employee compensation related expenses. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 10% in 2018, but decreased 10 basis points as a percentage of net sales. The increase reflects the impact of incremental selling, general and administrative expenses resulting from the acquisition of Rockwell Collins (1%). In addition, 2018 reflects higher expenses at Collins Aerospace Systems (3%) primarily driven by increased headcount and employee compensation related expenses; an increase at Carrier (2%) primarily driven by employee compensation related expenses; higher expenses at Pratt & Whitney (1%) driven by increased headcount and employee compensation related expenses and costs to support higher volumes; and higher expenses at Otis (1%) resulting from higher labor and information technology costs. The remaining increase includes transaction costs related to the acquisition of Rockwell Collins and the proposed separation of our commercial businesses into independent entities. 

We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions as a method of keeping our cost structure competitive. As appropriate, the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of restructuring actions on Selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 13 "Restructuring Costs" and the "Restructuring Costs" section of "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further discussion.

Other Income, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other income, net includes the operational impact of equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses as well as other ongoing and infrequently occurring items. In 2019, the year-over-year decrease in Other income, net (67%) primarily reflects the absence of the prior year gain on the sale of Taylor Company (51%), the impairment of an investment at Carrier (7%) and the net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses (5%).

In 2018, the year-over-year increase in Other income, net (15%) is primarily driven by the gain on the sale of Taylor Company (59%), partially offset by the absence of a prior year gain from the sale of Carrier's investments in Watsco, Inc. (28%), lower year-over-year gains on the sale of securities (11%), an impairment of assets related to a previously acquired Collins Aerospace Systems business (4%) and the absence of a prior year gain on the sale of a Carrier business (2%).

Interest Expense, Net

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

6

Interest expense, net increased 55% in 2019 as compared with 2018. The increase in interest expense primarily reflects interest on debt acquired from the Rockwell Collins acquisition and the impact of the August 16, 2018 issuance of notes representing $11 billion in aggregate principal. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2019 is approximately 10 years. The decrease in interest income in 2019 as compared to 2018 primarily reflects the absence of interest earned on higher cash balances held in the prior year in advance of funding the Rockwell Acquisition.

Interest expense, net increased 14% in 2018 as compared with 2017. The increase in interest expense reflects the impact of the August 16, 2018 issuance of notes representing $11 billion in aggregate principal; the May 4, 2017 issuance of notes representing $4 billion in aggregate principal; and the May 18, 2018 issuance of Euro-denominated notes representing €2 billion in aggregate principal. These increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of the repayment at maturity of the following: 1.800% notes in June 2017 representing $1.5 billion in aggregate principal; the 6.8% notes in February 2018 representing $99 million of aggregate principal; the Euro-denominated floating rate notes in February 2018 representing €750 million in aggregate principal; and the 1.778% notes in May 2018 representing $1.1 billion of aggregate principal. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2018 is approximately 11 years.

The $11 billion in aggregate principal amount of notes issued on August 16, 2018 was primarily used to fund the cash consideration in the acquisition of Rockwell Collins and related fees, expenses and other amounts. The increase in interest income in 2018 as compared with 2017 primarily reflects interest earned on higher cash balances, including interest earned on cash from the $11 billion of notes issued and held prior to funding the Rockwell Acquisition. 

The year-over-year increase in the average interest expense rate for short-term borrowings was primarily driven by increased borrowings under our term credit agreement. In 2018, the year-over-year increase in the average interest expense rate for short-term borrowings was primarily driven by increases in LIBOR rates. 

Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The 2019 effective tax rate includes $729 million of income tax charges associated with the Company’s portfolio separation transactions, offset in part by amounts associated with the conclusion of the audit by the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service for the UTC 2014, 2015 and 2016 tax years, the filing by a subsidiary of the Company to participate in an amnesty program offered by the Italian Tax Authority. 

On December 22, 2017 Public Law 115-97 “An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018” was enacted. This law is commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). 

The 2018 effective tax rate reflects a net charge of $744 million of TCJA related adjustments. The amount primarily relates to accounting completed under SAB 118 for non-U.S. taxes that will become due when previously reinvested earnings of certain international subsidiaries are remitted. 

The 2017 effective tax rate reflects a tax charge of $690 million attributable to the passage of the TCJA. This amount relates to U.S. income tax attributable to previously undistributed earnings of UTC's international subsidiaries and equity investments, net of foreign tax credits, and the revaluation of U.S. deferred income taxes. 

The effective income tax rate for 2017 also includes tax benefits associated with lower tax rates on international earnings and the expiration of statutes of limitations during 2017 resulted in a favorable adjustment of $55 million largely offset by the unfavorable impact related to a retroactive Quebec tax law change. 

For additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see "Critical Accounting Estimates—Income Taxes" and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Income Attributable to Common Shareowners from Continuing Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

To help mitigate the volatility of foreign currency exchange rates on our operating results, we maintain foreign currency hedging programs, the majority of which are entered into by Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC). In 2019, foreign currency, including hedging at P&WC, had a favorable impact on our consolidated operational results of $0.06 per diluted share. In 2018, foreign currency, including hedging at P&WC, had a favorable impact on our consolidated operational results of $0.02 per diluted share. In 2017, foreign currency, including hedging at P&WC, had a favorable impact on our consolidated operational 

7

results of $0.13 per diluted share. For additional discussion of foreign currency exposure, see "Market Risk and Risk Management—Foreign Currency Exposures."

Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes restructuring charges, net of tax benefit, of $317 million ($425 million pre-tax) as well as a net charge for significant non-operational and/or nonrecurring items, including the impact of taxes, of $1,282 million. Non-operational and/or nonrecurring items primarily include costs associated with the Company's intention to separate its commercial businesses, amortization of an inventory fair value adjustment associated with the Rockwell Acquisition, an impairment of an investment, transaction expenses associated with the Raytheon Merger, pension curtailment costs, and transaction and integration costs related to the Rockwell Acquisition. The effect of restructuring charges and nonrecurring items on diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a charge of $1.85 per share.

Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes restructuring charges, net of tax benefit, of $228 million ($307 million pre-tax) as well as a net charge for significant non-operational and/or nonrecurring items, including the impact of taxes, of $668 million. Non-operational and/or nonrecurring items include a tax charge in connection with the passage of the TCJA as described in Note 11 and the unfavorable impact of a customer contract matter at Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by a gain on Carrier's sale of Taylor Company. The effect of restructuring charges and nonrecurring items on diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a charge of $1.11 per share.

Net income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes restructuring charges, net of tax benefit, of $176 million ($253 million pre-tax) as well as the net unfavorable impact of significant non-operational and/or nonrecurring items, net of tax, of $587 million. Non-operational and/or nonrecurring items include a tax charge in connection with the passage of the TCJA as described in Note 11, the unfavorable impact of customer contract matters at Pratt & Whitney, and the unfavorable impact of a product recall program at Carrier, partially offset by gains resulting from Carrier's sale of its investments in Watsco, Inc. The effect of restructuring charges and nonrecurring items on diluted earnings per share for 2017 was a charge of $0.95 per share.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Restructuring actions are an essential component of our operating margin improvement efforts and relate to existing and recently acquired operations. Charges generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions, facility exit and lease termination costs associated with the consolidation of field and manufacturing operations and costs to exit legacy programs. We continue to closely monitor the economic environment and may undertake further restructuring actions to keep our cost structure aligned with the demands of the prevailing market conditions.

2019 Actions. During 2019, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $321 million relating to ongoing cost reduction actions initiated in 2019. We are targeting to complete in 2020 and 2021 the majority of the remaining workforce and facility related cost reduction actions initiated in 2019. Approximately 90% of the total pre-tax charge will require cash payments, which we have funded and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. During 2019, we had cash outflows of approximately $199 million related to the 2019 actions. We expect to incur additional restructuring and other charges of $123 million to complete these actions. We expect recurring pre-tax savings to increase over the two-year period subsequent to initiating the actions to approximately $389 million annually, of which, approximately $125 million was realized in 2019.

2018 Actions. During 2019 and 2018, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring charges of $46 million and $207 million, respectively, for actions initiated in 2018. We are targeting to complete in 2020 the majority of the remaining workforce and all facility related cost reduction actions initiated in 2018. Approximately 96% of the total pre-tax charge will require cash payments, which we have and expect to continue to fund with cash generated from operations. During 2019, we had cash outflows of approximately $143 million related to the 2018 actions. We expect to incur additional restructuring charges of $5 million to complete these actions. We expect recurring pre-tax savings to increase over the two-year period subsequent to initiating the actions to approximately $260 million annually.

In addition, during 2019, we recorded net pre-tax restructuring costs totaling $58 million for restructuring actions initiated in 2017 and prior. For additional discussion of restructuring, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

SEGMENT REVIEW

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Commercial Businesses

The financial performance of our commercial businesses can be influenced by a number of external factors including fluctuations in residential and commercial construction activity, regulatory changes, interest rates, labor costs, foreign currency exchange rates, customer attrition, raw material and energy costs, credit markets and other global and political factors. Carrier's financial performance can also be influenced by production and utilization of transport equipment, and weather conditions for its residential business. Geographic and industry diversity across the commercial businesses help to balance the impact of such factors on our consolidated operating results, particularly in the face of uneven economic growth. At constant currency, Otis new equipment orders were consistent with the prior year as order growth in Asia (3%) and Europe (2%) was offset by declines in North America (3%) and the Middle East (20%). At constant currency and excluding the effect of acquisitions and divestitures, Carrier equipment orders for 2019 decreased 8% in comparison to 2018 driven by a decline in global refrigeration (32%). Global HVAC and fire & security products equipment orders for 2019 were consistent with the prior year. 

Total commercial business sales generated outside the U.S., including U.S. export sales, were 61% and 62% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The following table shows sales generated outside the U.S., including U.S. export sales, for each of the commercial business segments:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared with 2018 

The organic sales increase of 1% was primarily driven by growth in commercial and residential HVAC (1%, combined). Sales in global fire & security and global refrigeration were consistent with the prior year.

 Operational profit decreased 2% in comparison to the prior year as the favorable impact of pricing and productivity net of unfavorable commodities and tariffs (4%, combined) were more than offset by lower volume and unfavorable mix (3%), the absence of a favorable prior year contract adjustment related to a large commercial project (1%), and the unfavorable year-over-year impact resulting from the revaluation of certain long-term liabilities (1%).

 The 24% decrease in Other primarily reflects the absence of the prior year gain on the sale of Taylor Company (21%) and a current-year impairment of an investment (3%).

2018 Compared with 2017 

The organic sales increase of 6% was driven primarily by growth in North America residential HVAC (2%), global commercial HVAC (2%), and global refrigeration (2%).

The operational profit increase of 6% was driven by:

•profit contribution from the higher sales volumes noted above, net of mix (6%) 

•the year-over-year impact of contract adjustments related to a large commercial project (3%)

•favorable pricing, net of commodities (2%)

These increases were partially offset by:

•higher logistics costs (3%)

•higher research and development costs (1%)

The 13% increase in Other primarily reflects the year-over-year impact of gains on sale of businesses and investments (11%), primarily driven by the sale of Taylor Company in 2018 (25%), partially offset by the absence of the prior year sale of investments in Watsco, Inc. (12%). The remaining increase in Other is largely driven by the year-over-year impact of a prior year product recall program (2%).

Aerospace Businesses

The financial performance of Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems is directly tied to the economic conditions of the commercial aerospace and defense aerospace industries. In particular, Pratt & Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participate in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these engine sales. These OEM engine sales may result in losses on the engine sales, which economically are recovered through the sales and profits generated over the engine's maintenance cycle. At times, the aerospace businesses also enter into development programs and firm fixed-price development contracts, which may require the company to bear cost overruns related to unforeseen technical and design challenges that arise during the development stage of the program. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and service. Predicted traffic levels, load factors, worldwide airline profits, general economic activity and global defense spending have been reliable indicators for new aircraft and aftermarket orders within the aerospace industry. Spare part sales and aftermarket service trends are affected by many factors, including usage, technological improvements, pricing, regulatory changes and the retirement of older aircraft. Our commercial aftermarket businesses continue to evolve as an increasing proportion of our aerospace businesses' customers are covered under long-term aftermarket service agreements. These agreements are comprehensive long-term spare part and service agreements with our customers. We expect a continued shift to long-term aftermarket service agreements in lieu of transactional spare part sales as new aerospace products enter our customers' fleets under long-term aftermarket service agreements and legacy fleets are retired. In 2019, as compared with 2018, total commercial aerospace aftermarket sales increased 2% at Pratt & Whitney and 63% at Collins Aerospace Systems, or 14% excluding the impact of the Rockwell Acquisition. 

Our long-term aerospace contracts are subject to strict safety and performance regulations which can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely. Contract cost estimation for the development of complex projects, in particular, requires management to make significant judgments and assumptions regarding the complexity of the work to be performed, availability of materials, the performance by subcontractors, the timing of funding from customers and the length of time to complete the contract. As a result, we review and update our cost estimates on significant contracts on a quarterly basis, and no less frequently than annually for all others, and when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Changes in estimates relate to the current period impact of revisions to total estimated contract sales and costs at completion. We record changes in contract estimates primarily using the cumulative catch-up method. Operating profits included net unfavorable changes in aerospace contract estimates of approximately $69 million, $50 million and $110 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily the result of unexpected increases in estimated costs related to Pratt & Whitney long-term aftermarket agreements. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, losses, if any, on long-term contracts are provided for when anticipated. There were no material loss provisions recorded in continuing operations in 2019 or 2018.

 Performance in the general aviation sector is closely tied to the overall health of the economy. We continue to see growth in a strong commercial airline industry. Airline traffic, as measured by revenue passenger miles (RPMs), grew approximately 4% in the first eleven months of 2019. 

Our military sales are affected by U.S. Department of Defense spending levels. Total sales to the U.S. Government were $10.6 billion in 2019, $7.4 billion in 2018, and $5.8 billion in 2017, and were 14% of total UTC sales in 2019, and 11% in 2018 and 10% in 2017. The defense portion of our aerospace business is also affected by changes in market demand and the global political environment. Our participation in long-term production and development programs for the U.S. Government has contributed positively to our results in 2019 and is expected to continue to benefit results in 2020.

Collins Aerospace Systems provides standard and selectable content to Boeing for its 737 MAX aircraft including standard avionics, cockpit flight displays, and cabin interior products. In March 2019, aviation authorities suspended worldwide operations of the Boeing 737 MAX fleet. In January 2020, Boeing announced that it expects the fleet to remain grounded until mid-2020. In addition, Boeing announced the temporary suspension of 737 MAX production. The Company has made various investments in support of content for the 737 MAX which we currently expect to recover despite these delays in the production and operation of the fleet.

* As discussed further in the "Business Overview" and "Results of Operations" sections, for Pratt & Whitney only, the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at P&WC has been netted against the translational foreign exchange impact for presentation purposes in the above table. For all other segments, these foreign exchange transactional impacts are included within the organic sales/operational operating profit caption in their respective tables. Due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney's overall operating results, we believe it is useful to segregate the foreign exchange transactional impact in order to clearly identify the underlying financial performance.

2019 Compared with 2018 

 The organic sales growth of 8% primarily reflects higher military sales (4%), higher commercial OEM sales (3%), and higher commercial aftermarket sales (1%). 

 The operational profit increase of 18% was primarily driven by:

•higher military margin contribution (13%), driven by the sales increase noted above

•higher OEM margin contribution (11%) primarily driven by continued year-over-year cost reduction and favorable mix on large commercial engine shipments 

 These increases were partially offset by:

•higher research and development costs (4%)

•higher selling, general and administrative expenses (3%)

 The 26% increase in "Other" primarily reflects the absence of a prior year customer contract settlement.

2018 Compared with 2017

The organic sales increase of 14% primarily reflects higher commercial aftermarket sales (6%), higher commercial OEM sales (5%) and increased military sales (3%). The 6% increase in Other primarily reflects the impact of the adoption of the New Revenue Standard (4%) and the absence of a prior year customer contract matter (2%).

 The operational profit decrease of 8% was primarily driven by:

•lower commercial OEM profit contribution (27%) primarily driven by higher negative engine margin on higher deliveries

•higher selling, general and administrative expenses (5%)

13

•the absence of the favorable impact from a prior year license agreement (4%)

•higher research and development costs (2%)

 These decreases were partially offset by:

•higher commercial aftermarket profit contribution (23%), driven by the sales increase noted above

•higher military profit contribution (5%), driven by the sales increase noted above

The 5% increase in Other primarily reflects the favorable impact resulting from the adoption of the New Revenue Standard (13%) partially offset by the unfavorable year-over-year impact of contract settlements (8%).

Eliminations and other

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Eliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller businesses. The year-over-year increase in sales eliminations in 2019 as compared with 2018 reflects an increase in the amount of inter-segment eliminations, principally between our aerospace businesses. The year-over-year decrease in operating profit for 2019 as compared with 2018, is primarily driven by costs associated with the Company's intention to separate its commercial businesses, costs associated with the Raytheon merger, and the absence of the favorable impact of prior year insurance settlements, partially offset by lower year-over-year costs related to the Rockwell Acquisition.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Our principal source of liquidity is operating cash flows from operations. For 2019 our cash flows from operations, net of capital expenditures was $6.6 billion. The 2019 cash flows from operations reflect cash payments associated with the Company's portfolio separation costs of approximately $400 million. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to the commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms.

 At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $7.4 billion, of which approximately 56% was held by UTC's foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company no longer intends to reinvest certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. As such, in 2018 it recorded the international taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, UTC will continue to 

15

permanently reinvest these earnings. We repatriated $1.6 billion and $6.2 billion of overseas cash for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

On occasion, we are required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks with respect to contractual obligations related to acquisitions or divestitures or other legal obligations. As of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the amount of such restricted cash was approximately $42 million, $60 million and $33 million, respectively. 

On November 26, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins. The total aggregate consideration payable in the Merger was $15.5 billion in cash ($14.9 billion net of cash acquired) and 62.2 million shares of Company common stock. In addition, $7.8 billion of Rockwell Collins debt was outstanding as of the acquisition date. Refer to Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the Rockwell Acquisition. 

Our domestic pension funds experienced a positive return on assets of 19.8% during 2019 and a negative return on assets of 5.1% during 2018. Approximately 90% of these domestic pension plans' funds are invested in readily-liquid investments, including equity, fixed income, asset-backed receivables and structured products. The balance of these domestic pension plans' funds (10%) is invested in less-liquid but market-valued investments, including real estate and private equity. As part of the Rockwell Collins acquisition on November 26, 2018, we assumed approximately $3.7 billion of projected pension benefit obligations and $3.4 billion of plan assets. As part of our long-term strategy to de-risk our defined benefit pension plans, we made discretionary contributions of approximately $1.9 billion to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in 2017.

The funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates and actuarial mortality assumptions. We can contribute cash or UTC shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2019, the total investment by the global defined benefit pension plans in the Company's securities was less than 1% of total plan assets. Our qualified domestic defined benefit pension plans are approximately 99% funded on a projected benefit obligation basis as of December 31, 2019, and we are not required to make additional contributions through the end of 2025. We expect to make total contributions of approximately $125 million to our global defined benefit pension plans in 2020. Contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans in 2020 are expected to meet or exceed the current funding requirements.

Historically, our strong debt ratings and financial position have enabled us to issue long-term debt at favorable market rates. Our ability to obtain debt financing or additional credit facilities at comparable risk-based interest rates is partly a function of our existing debt-to-total-capitalization level as well as our credit standing. Our debt-to-total-capitalization decreased 300 basis points from 53% at December 31, 2018 to 50% at December 31, 2019. The average maturity of our long-term debt at December 31, 2019 is approximately 10 years. 

At December 31, 2019, we had revolving credit agreements with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $10.35 billion pursuant to a $2.20 billion revolving credit agreement and a $2.15 billion multicurrency revolving credit agreement, both of which expire in August 2021; and a $2.0 billion revolving credit agreement and a $4.0 billion term credit agreement, both of which we entered into on March 15, 2019 and which will expire on March 15, 2021 or, if earlier, the date that is 180 days after the date on which each of the separations of Otis and Carrier have been consummated. As of December 31, 2019, we drew down $2.1 billion on the term credit agreement to pay current debt maturities. There were no borrowings on any of the other agreements. The undrawn portions of the revolving credit agreements are also available to serve as backup facilities for the issuance of commercial paper. 

As of December 31, 2019, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $6.35 billion. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2019. We use our commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments and repurchases of our common stock. The need for commercial paper borrowings arises when the use of domestic cash for general corporate purposes exceeds the sum of domestic cash generation and foreign cash repatriated to the U.S.

We have an existing universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. 

We had no debt issuances in 2019 and the following issuances of debt in 2018 and 2017:

16

(dollars in millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The net proceeds received from these debt issuances were used to partially finance the cash consideration portion of the purchase price for Rockwell Collins and fees, expenses and other amounts related to the acquisition of Rockwell Collins. 

2 The net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to fund the repayment of commercial paper and for other general corporate purposes. 

3 The net proceeds received from these debt issuances were used for general corporate purposes. 

4 The net proceeds received from these debt issuances were used to fund the repayment at maturity of our 1.800% notes due 2017, representing $1.5 billion in aggregate principal and other general corporate purposes. 

We made the following repayments of debt in 2019, 2018 and 2017:

(dollars in millions)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 These notes and term loan were assumed in connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition and subsequently repaid. 

 We believe our future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required or appropriate.

Cash Flow—Operating Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared with 2018 

Cash generated from operating activities in 2019 was approximately $2.6 billion higher than 2018. This increase is largely driven by an increase in Net income after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax provision, stock compensation costs, net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit, portfolio separation costs, and the gain on the sale of Taylor Company of $2.4 billion and working capital improvements of $0.9 billion, partially offset by outflows with other long term assets and liabilities of $0.9 billion. Reduced factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $1.6 billion in cash flows from operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to the prior year. This decrease in factoring activity was primarily driven from an increase in funded factoring levels at Pratt & Whitney partially offset by increased factoring at Collins Aerospace Systems. Factoring activity does not reflect the factoring of certain receivables performed at customer request for which we are compensated by the customer for the extended collection cycle.

The 2019 cash flows provided by working capital were $175 million. Accounts receivable decreased $419 million primarily driven by a decrease in V2500 sales and lower collaborator receivables at Pratt & Whitney and an increase in factoring activity at Collins Aerospace. Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $1.2 billion. The Accounts payable increase is primarily driven by Pratt & Whitney due to an increase in collaborator payables. The increase in Accrued liabilities was driven by an increase in accrued costs for the Company's portfolio separation and various accruals at Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney. Contract liabilities, current increased $359 million driven by Collins Aerospace due to higher advanced billings. These inflows were partially offset by increases in Contract assets, current, Inventory and Other current assets. Contract assets, current increased $307 million due to work performed in excess of billings at Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace. Inventory increased $1.2 billion to support higher sales volume at Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney. Other current assets increased $309 million due to increases in prepaid expenses at Pratt & Whitney. 

 Total cash contributions to our global defined benefit pension plans were $118 million, $147 million and $2,112 million during 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

2018 Compared with 2017 

Cash generated from operating activities in 2018 was approximately $691 million higher than 2017. Cash outflows for working capital increased $703 million over the prior period to support higher top line organic growth. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of approximately $148 million in cash generated from operating activities during the year ended, December 31, 2018, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven from lower factoring levels at Pratt & Whitney and Carrier. Factoring activity does not reflect the factoring of certain aerospace receivables performed at customer request for which we are compensated by the customer for the extended collection cycle.

The 2018 cash outflows from working capital were $755 million. Accounts receivable increased approximately $2.4 billion due to an increase in sales volume. Contract assets, current increased $604 million due to costs in excess of billings primarily at Pratt & Whitney driven by military engines, at Otis due to progression on major projects, and at Collins Aerospace Systems. Inventory increased $537 million primarily driven by an increase in production for the Geared Turbofan at Pratt & Whitney, increases at Carrier to support higher sales volume and increases at Collins Aerospace Systems. This was partially offset by decreases in Other assets of $161 million primarily due to tax refunds received, an increase in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities of approximately $2.4 billion, driven by higher inventory purchasing activity at Pratt & Whitney and higher direct material purchases at Collins Aerospace Systems, as well as an increase in Contract liabilities, current of $205 million driven by progress payments on major contracts and seasonal advanced billings at Otis.

Cash Flow—Investing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared with 2018 

Cash flows used in investing activities for 2019 and 2018 primarily reflect capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments/dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts. The $13.9 billion decrease in cash flows used in investing activities in 2019 the compared to 2018 primarily relates to the absence of cash paid to acquire Rockwell Collins of $14.9 billion in November 2018 and the absence of $1 billion in proceeds from the sale of Taylor Company in June 2018 by Carrier. 

18

Capital expenditures in 2019 ($2.3 billion) primarily relate to several projects at Collins Aerospace Systems and investments in production and aftermarket capacity at Pratt & Whitney. 

Cash investments in businesses in 2019 ($56 million) primarily consisted of several acquisitions at Otis. Dispositions of businesses in 2019 ($138 million) primarily consisted of the businesses sold in connection with the Rockwell Collins acquisition.

Customer financing assets is primarily driven by additional Geared Turbofan engines to support customer fleets and was a use of cash of $787 million and $988 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the source of cash related to customer financing assets of $129 million in 2019 compared to $606 million in 2018 is driven by lower repayments on customer financing. At December 31, 2019, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments of approximately $15.0 billion related to commercial aircraft and certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, of which as much as $1.6 billion may be required to be disbursed during 2020. As discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaborators in these commitments. At December 31, 2019, our collaborators' share of these commitments was approximately $5.3 billion of which as much as $508 million may be required to be disbursed to us during 2020. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of our commercial aerospace industry assets and commitments.

In 2019, we increased our collaboration intangible assets by approximately $351 million, which primarily relates to payments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's collaboration interests in IAE. 

As discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we enter into derivative instruments for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments under the Derivatives and Hedging Topic of the FASB ASC and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and, in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate and commodity price exposures. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had net cash receipts of approximately $336 million and $143 million, respectively, from the settlement of these derivative instruments.

2018 Compared with 2017 

Cash flows used in investing activities for 2018 and 2017 primarily reflect capital investments/dispositions of businesses, expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms and settlements of derivative contracts. The $14 billion increase in cash flows used in investing activities from the prior year primarily relates to the $14.9 billion of cash paid for the acquisition of Rockwell Collins (net of cash acquired) and the absence of $596 million in net proceeds received from Carrier's sale of investments in Watsco, Inc. in 2017, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Taylor Company in June 2018 by Carrier of $1.0 billion, a decrease in customer financing assets of $593 million and $143 million in receipts from settlements of derivative contracts compared to payments of $317 million in 2017.

Capital expenditures in 2018 ($1,902 million) primarily relate to investments in production capacity at Pratt & Whitney, investments in production capacity and several small projects at Collins Aerospace Systems, and new facilities and investments in products and information technology at Carrier, and investments in digital and information technology at Otis.

Cash investments in businesses (net of cash acquired) in 2018 ($15.4 billion) primarily relate to the acquisition of Rockwell Collins in November 2018. Dispositions of businesses in 2018 of $1.1 billion primarily relate to the sale of Taylor Company.

Customer financing activities, primarily driven by additional Geared Turbofan engines to support customer fleets, were a net use of cash of $382 million and $975 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments of approximately $15.5 billion related to commercial aircraft and certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, of which as much as $1.7 billion have been be required to be disbursed during 2019. At December 31, 2018, our collaborators' share of these commitments was approximately $5.3 billion of which as much as $468 million may have been required to be dispersed to us during 2019. 

In 2018, we increased our collaboration intangible assets by approximately $400 million, which primarily relates to payments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's collaboration interests in IAE. 

19

Cash Flow—Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Compared with 2018 

Our financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. Financing activities was a cash outflow of $4.6 billion in 2019 compared to a cash inflow of $8.0 billion in 2018. This change is driven by the absence of $13.5 billion of long-term debt issuances in the prior year which was primarily utilized to fund the Rockwell Acquisition, an increase in debt repayments of $0.3 billion, an increase in dividends paid on common stock of $0.3 billion, partially offset by an increase in short term borrowings of $1.3 billion and a reduction in common stock repurchases of $0.2 billion.

Commercial paper borrowings and revolving credit facilities provide short-term liquidity to supplement operating cash flows and are used for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions and repurchases of our stock. We had no outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2019.

At December 31, 2019, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $1.8 billion of our common stock under the October 14, 2015 share repurchase program. Under this program, shares may be purchased on the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, under accelerated share repurchase programs, and under plans complying with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. We may also reacquire shares outside of the program from time to time in connection with the surrender of shares to cover taxes on vesting of restricted stock and as required under our employee savings plan. Our ability to repurchase shares is subject to applicable law, including restrictions arising from the pending merger transaction with Raytheon. We made cash payments of approximately $151 million to repurchase approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019. 

We paid aggregate dividends on common stock of approximately $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. On February 3, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.735 per share payable March 10, 2020 to shareowners of record at the close of business on February 14, 2020.

2018 Compared with 2017 

Net cash provided by financing activities increased $8,958 million in 2018 compared to the prior year due to an increase in long-term debt issuances of $8.5 billion, including the $11 billion issued in 2018 for the financing of the Rockwell Collins acquisition, and a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $1.1 billion, partially offset by an increase in repayments of long-term debt of $0.9 billion.

We had approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding commercial paper at December 31, 2018.

We made cash payments of approximately $325 million to repurchase approximately 2.7 million shares of our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2018. 

We paid aggregate dividends on common stock of approximately $2.2 billion and $2.1 billion in 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

Preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management's estimates.

Long-Term Contract Accounting. As described in Note 1, several of our businesses use an over-time revenue recognition model. Revenue is recognized on an over-time basis using an input method for repair contracts within Otis and Carrier; certain U.S. Government and commercial aerospace equipment contracts; and aerospace aftermarket service work. We measure progress toward completion for these contracts using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. This over-time basis using an input method requires estimates of future revenues and costs over the full term of product and/or service delivery. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management's judgment. 

20

The long-term nature of these contracts, the complexity of the products, and the strict safety and performance standards under which they are regulated can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely. As a result, we review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a quarterly basis and for others, at least annually or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. We record changes in contract estimates using the cumulative catch-up method.

Costs incurred for engineering and development of aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin, and subsequently amortized as the OEM products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract margin requires management's judgment.

Income Taxes. The future tax benefit arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2019 and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2018. Management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.

In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we estimate future taxable income, considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made.

In the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the separation transactions. We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See Notes 1 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Also see Note 18 for discussion of UTC administrative review proceedings with the German Tax Office.

See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional tax provision items.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Our investments in businesses net of cash acquired in 2019 totaled $56 million. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets consist of service portfolios, patents, trademarks/tradenames, customer relationships and other intangible assets including a collaboration asset established in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's ownership and collaboration interests in IAE AG, as discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the tradename intangible assets were determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. 

Also included within other intangible assets are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. Capitalized payments made on these contractual commitments are amortized as a reduction of sales. We amortize these intangible assets based on the pattern of economic benefit, which typically results in an amortization method other than straight-line. In the aerospace industry, amortization based on the pattern of economic benefit generally results in lower amortization expense during the development period with increasing amortization expense as programs enter full production and aftermarket cycles. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined, a straight-line amortization method is used. The gross value of these contractual commitments at December 31, 2019 was approximately $12.3 billion, of 

21

which approximately $3.2 billion has been paid to date. We record these payments as intangible assets when such payments are no longer conditional. The recoverability of these intangibles is dependent upon the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms including the associated aftermarket revenue streams.

Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing using the guidance and criteria described in the Intangibles—Goodwill and Other Topic of the FASB ASC. A goodwill impairment loss is measured at the amount by which a reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, without exceeding the recorded amount of goodwill. In developing our estimates for the fair value of our reporting units, significant judgment is required in the determination of the appropriateness of using a qualitative assessment or quantitative assessment. For these quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on income approaches using discounted cash flow models and relief from royalty models, respectively, which have significant assumptions including revenue growth rates, projected operating income, terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by global market conditions. We completed our annual impairment testing as of July 1, 2019 and determined that no significant adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets were necessary. Although these assets are not currently impaired, there can be no assurance that future impairments will not occur. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Contingent Liabilities. Our operating units include businesses which sell products and services and conduct operations throughout the world. As described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, contractual, regulatory and other matters, including asbestos claims, in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation. Of note, the design, development, production and support of new aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Since the PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine entered into service in 2016, technical issues have been identified and experienced with the engine, which is typical for new engines and new aerospace technologies. Pratt & Whitney has addressed these issues through various improvements and modifications. These issues have resulted in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and reductions in contract performance estimates. Additional technical issues may also arise in the normal course, which may result in financial impacts that could be material to the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. Government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of then currently available facts with respect to each matter. When no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters can result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. 

Employee Benefit Plans. We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, rate of increase in employee compensation levels, mortality rates, and health care cost increase projections. Assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators, and are evaluated each year at December 31. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost and service cost as of December 31, 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The impact on net periodic postretirement (benefit) cost is less than $1M. 

These estimates assume no change in the shape or steepness of the company-specific yield curve used to plot the individual spot rates that will be applied to the future cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve, from a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates, 

22

would increase our net periodic pension cost. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve, from an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates, would decrease our net periodic pension cost.

Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have decreased or increased 2019 pension expense by approximately $89 million.

The weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension liabilities and costs are set by reference to UTC-specific analyses using each plan's specific cash flows and are then compared to high-quality bond indices for reasonableness. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. Global market interest rates have decreased in 2019 as compared with 2018 and, as a result, the weighted-average discount rate used to measure pension liabilities decreased from 4.0% in 2018 to 3.0% in 2019. The weighted-average discount rates used to measure service cost and interest cost was 3.6% in 2019. Across our global pension plans, the amendment to our domestic pension plans to cease accrual of additional benefits and domestic pension plan merger, partially offset by reduction in expected return on assets for 2020, will result in a net periodic pension benefit in 2020 consistent with 2019 amounts. 

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

We extend a variety of financial guarantees to third parties in support of unconsolidated affiliates and for potential financing requirements of commercial aerospace customers. We also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including indemnities for representations and warranties and environmental, health and safety, tax and employment matters. Circumstances that could cause the contingent obligations and liabilities arising from these arrangements to come to fruition include changes in an underlying transaction (e.g., hazardous waste discoveries, etc.), nonperformance under a contract, customer requests for financing, or deterioration in the financial condition of the guaranteed party.

A summary of our consolidated contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 is as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Purchase obligations include amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders. Where it is not practically feasible to determine the legally enforceable portion of our obligation under certain of our long-term purchase agreements, we include additional expected purchase obligations beyond what is legally enforceable. Approximately 19% of the purchase obligations disclosed above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. Government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.

Other long-term liabilities primarily include those amounts on our December 31, 2019 balance sheet representing obligations under product service and warranty policies, performance and operating cost guarantees, estimated environmental remediation costs and expected contributions under employee benefit programs. The timing of expected cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management's estimates over the terms of these agreements and is largely based upon historical experience.

In connection with the acquisitions of Rockwell Collins in 2018 and Goodrich in 2012, we recorded assumed liabilities of approximately $1.03 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively related to customer contractual obligations on certain programs with terms less favorable than could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date. These liabilities are being liquidated in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligations, as reflected by the net cash outflows incurred on the contracts. Total consumption of the contractual obligations for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $345 million. Total future consumption of the contractual obligations is expected to be as follows: $263 million in 2020, $189 million in 2021, $148 million in 2022, $118 million in 2023, $127 million in 2024 and $563 million thereafter. These amounts are not included in the table above. 

23

 The above table also does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1,347 million, the timing of which is uncertain, except for approximately $24 million that may become payable during 2020. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits.

COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce's ownership and collaboration interests in IAE AG, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, included in "Other commercial aerospace commitments" in the table above, are being capitalized as collaboration intangible assets. The collaboration intangible assets are amortized based upon the pattern of economic benefit as represented by the underlying cash flows.

We also have other contractual commitments, including commitments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, which are included in "Other commercial aerospace commitments" in the table above. Such payments are capitalized when distinct rights are obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. Capitalized payments made on these contractual commitments are included in intangible assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit.

Refer to Notes 1, 4 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on contractual and commercial commitments.

MARKET RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. To manage certain of those exposures, we use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts and options. Derivative instruments utilized by us in our hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools, involve relatively little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. We diversify the counterparties used and monitor the concentration of risk to limit our counterparty exposure.

We have evaluated our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices in our market risk sensitive instruments, which are primarily cash, debt, and derivative instruments, using a value at risk analysis. Based on a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period, at December 31, 2019, the potential loss in fair value on our market risk sensitive instruments was not material in relation to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses based on volatilities and correlations and is not necessarily indicative of actual results. Refer to Notes 1, 9 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange, interest rates and financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Exposures. We have a large volume of foreign currency exposures that result from our international sales, purchases, investments, borrowings and other international transactions. International segment sales, excluding U.S. export sales, averaged approximately $27 billion over the last three years. We actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales, and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level. More than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. We also have a significant amount of foreign currency net asset exposures. As discussed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at December 31, 2019 we have approximately €4.20 billion of euro-denominated long-term debt, which qualifies as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses. As of December 31, 2019, the net investment hedge is deemed to be effective. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency net asset exposures but may consider such strategies in the future.

Within aerospace, our sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars under accepted industry convention. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, such as P&WC, a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, 

24

there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which U.S. Dollars will be converted. The majority of this hedging activity occurs at P&WC and Collins Aerospace Systems, and hedging activity also occurs to a lesser extent at the remainder of Pratt & Whitney. At P&WC and Collins Aerospace Systems, firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts for up to 49 months on the U.S. Dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of U.S. Dollar sales over U.S. Dollar denominated purchases. Hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign currency exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates and other such operational considerations.

Interest Rate Exposures. Our long-term debt portfolio consists mostly of fixed-rate instruments. From time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. The hedges are designated as fair value hedges and the gains and losses on the swaps are reported in interest expense, reflecting that portion of interest expense at a variable rate. We issue commercial paper, which exposes us to changes in interest rates. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future.

Commodity Price Exposures. We are exposed to volatility in the prices of raw materials used in some of our products and from time to time we may use forward contracts in limited circumstances to manage some of those exposures. In the future, if hedges are used, gains and losses may affect earnings. There were no significant outstanding commodity hedges as of December 31, 2019.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. As a result, we have established, and continually update, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for our operations worldwide. We believe that expenditures necessary to comply with the present regulations governing environmental protection will not have a material effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

We have identified 773 locations, mostly in the United States, at which we may have some liability for remediating contamination. We have resolved our liability at 363 of these locations. We do not believe that any individual location's exposure will have a material effect on our results of operations. Sites in the investigation, remediation or operation and maintenance stage represent approximately 91% of our accrued environmental remediation reserve.

We have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA or Superfund) at 129 sites. The number of Superfund sites, in and of itself, does not represent a relevant measure of liability because the nature and extent of environmental concerns vary from site to site and our share of responsibility varies from sole responsibility to very little responsibility. In estimating our liability for remediation, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of other potentially responsible parties to fulfill their obligations.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $896 million and $830 million reserved for environmental remediation, respectively. Cash outflows for environmental remediation were $52 million in 2019, $48 million in 2018 and $42 million in 2017. We estimate that ongoing environmental remediation expenditures in each of the next two years will not exceed approximately $100 million. 

25

ASBESTOS MATTERS

The estimated range of total liabilities to resolve all pending and unasserted potential future asbestos claims through 2059 is approximately $330 million to $400 million. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. We have recorded the minimum amount of $330 million, which is principally recorded in Other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. This amount is on a pre-tax basis, not discounted, and excludes the Company’s legal fees to defend the asbestos claims (which will continue to be expensed by the Company as they are incurred). In addition, the Company has an insurance recovery receivable for probable asbestos related recoveries of approximately $140 million, which is included primarily in Other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2019. See Note 18 "Contingent Liabilities" of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this matter.

GOVERNMENT MATTERS

As described in "Critical Accounting Estimates—Contingent Liabilities," our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. Government with respect to government contract matters. See "Legal Proceedings" in Item 1 to this Form 10-K, and Note 11 "Income Taxes" and Note 18 "Contingent Liabilities" of our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these and other government matters.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

The management of UTC is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. 

Management has assessed the effectiveness of UTC's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its Internal Control—Integrated Framework, released in 2013. Management concluded that based on its assessment, UTC's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. The effectiveness of UTC's internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2019, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.
