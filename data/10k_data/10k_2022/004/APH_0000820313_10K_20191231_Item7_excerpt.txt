Overview

​

General

​

Amphenol Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “Amphenol”, the “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is one of the world’s largest designers, manufacturers and marketers of electrical, electronic and fiber optic connectors and interconnect systems, antennas, sensors and sensor-based products and coaxial and high-speed specialty cable. The Company operates through two reporting segments: (i) Interconnect Products and Assemblies and (ii) Cable Products and Solutions.

​

In 2019, the Company reported net sales of $8,225.4, which was flat compared to 2018, along with operating income and net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation of $1,619.2 and $1,155.0, respectively, both representing a decrease of 4% from 2018. In 2019, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by (a) excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $38.1 resulting from stock option exercises, partially offset by (b) acquisition-related expenses of $25.4 ($21.0 after-tax) primarily from the amortization related to the value associated with acquired backlog as well as external transaction costs and (c) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt of $14.3 ($12.5 after-tax), comprised primarily of the premiums and other fees incurred from the early extinguishment of redeemed amounts of our 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes resulting from the tender offers in September 2019 described herein under “Liquidity and Capital Resources – Financing Activities”. In 2018, the Company’s net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation was impacted by the recognition of an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge (defined below) in the fourth quarter of 2018, along with excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises, partially offset by acquisition-related expenses incurred during the year. Excluding the effects of these items, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and as reconciled in Part II, Item 7 herein, decreased by 3% and 2%, respectively, in 2019. Sales and profitability trends are discussed in detail in “Results of Operations” below. In addition, a strength of the Company has been its ability to consistently generate cash from operations. The Company uses cash generated from operations to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, repurchase shares of its common stock, pay dividends and reduce indebtedness. In 2019, the Company generated operating cash flow of $1,502.3, which net of capital expenditures of $295.0, resulted in Free cash flow of $1,207.3. Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below and reconciled within this Part II, Item 7 herein.

​

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017

​

On December 22, 2017, the United States federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), marking a change from a worldwide tax system to a modified territorial tax system in the United States and a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. As a result of the Tax Act, in the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded an income tax charge of $398.5 (“Tax Act Charge”). The Tax Act Charge was a provisional amount recorded in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which was subsequently codified under ASU 2018-05, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118. Consistent with ASU 2018-05, the Company completed its accounting of the Tax Act Charge and recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018, reflecting the interpretive guidance that was issued subsequent to our 2017 Form 10-K filing. While the Company completed its accounting of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 based on the regulatory guidance issued at that time, the Department of Treasury interpretive guidance initiatives are ongoing. Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Tax Act.

Results of Operations

​

The following table sets forth the components of net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated.

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

2019 Compared to 2018

​

Net sales were $8,225.4 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018, which was flat in U.S. dollars, an increase of 2% in constant currencies and a decrease of 3% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts), over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 1% in U.S. dollars and 2% in constant currencies, while decreasing 3% organically, in 2019 compared to 2018. The sales growth was driven by strong growth in the military and commercial aerospace markets as well as contributions from the Company’s acquisition program. This sales growth was largely offset by reductions in the communications-related markets, in particular the mobile devices market, along with the negative effect of currency translation. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $181.0), driven by broad-based strength across essentially all segments including military vehicle, rotorcraft, and military airframe applications. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $48.7) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales to the industrial market increased (approximately $66.1), primarily driven by contributions from acquisitions, as well as strength in medical and factory automation applications, which were partially offset by moderations in industrial instrumentation, heavy equipment and transportation, as well as other applications. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $38.0), driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions, which were partially offset by moderations in demand due to the slowing of the worldwide automotive market. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market slightly increased (approximately $5.6), driven primarily by contributions from acquisitions and organic growth of sales to data center customers, offset by moderations in market demand for storage and networking related products. Net sales to the mobile devices market decreased (approximately $277.5), driven by moderations in sales of products incorporated into smartphones. Net sales to the mobile networks market decreased (approximately $10.2), due to reduced demand from both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators, offset in part by contributions from acquisitions. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, decreased 8% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 7% organically in 2019, compared to 2018. The decrease in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to a reduction in demand from broadband service providers.

The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

(1)Net sales growth in U.S. dollars is calculated based on Net sales as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Note 13 of the accompanying financial statements. While the term “net sales growth in U.S. dollars” is not considered a U.S. GAAP financial measure, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measure based on GAAP results, which serves as the basis for the reconciliation to its comparable non-GAAP financial measures.

(2)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales.

(3)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.

(4)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. 

​

Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2019 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,524.7 in 2019 versus $2,241.4 in 2018) and 4% organically, compared to 2018. Foreign sales in 2019 decreased approximately 4% in U.S. dollars ($5,700.7 in 2019 versus $5,960.6 in 2018), 2% in constant currencies and 6% organically, compared to 2018, driven by moderations in Asia. The comparatively stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 had the effect of decreasing net sales by approximately $125.8 when compared to foreign currency translation rates in 2018.

​

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $971.4 or 11.8% of net sales for 2019, compared to $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018. Administrative expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in both years. Research and development expenses increased approximately $13.3 in 2019 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development, and represented approximately 2.8% of net sales in 2019 and 2.7% of net sales in 2018. Selling and marketing expenses were flat in 2019 compared to 2018, and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in both years.

​

Operating income was $1,619.2 or 19.7% of net sales in 2019, compared to $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018. Operating income for 2019 included acquisition-related expenses of $25.4, comprising of the amortization of $15.7 related to the value associated with acquired backlog resulting from 2019 acquisitions, with the remainder representing external transaction costs. Operating income for 2018 included acquisition-related expenses of $8.5, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,644.6 or 20.0% of net sales in 2019 and $1,695.4 or 20.7% in 2018. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2019 was $1,722.7 or 22.0% of net sales, compared to $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales in 2018. The slight decrease in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by normal downside conversion related to the organic decline in sales as well as the impact of recent acquisitions which currently have, on average, a lower operating margin than the average of the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2019 was $39.5 or 10.2% of net sales, compared to $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales in 2018. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily driven by lower volumes and product mix.

​

Interest expense was $117.6 in 2019 compared to $101.7 in 2018. The increase is primarily due to higher average debt levels and the higher average interest rate associated with the 4.350% U.S. Senior Notes issuance in January 2019 (the net proceeds of which, along with commercial paper borrowings, were used to repay the Company’s 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes also in January 2019). 

​

Loss on early extinguishment of debt was $14.3 in 2019, which related to refinancing-related costs, specifically premiums and fees incurred associated with the early extinguishment of certain redeemed principal amounts of the 3.125% Senior Notes and 4.00% Senior Notes (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”) as a result of the tender offers in 

25 
September 2019. Refer to Note 4 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and the Liquidity and Capital Resources section within this Item 7 for further information related to the Tendered Notes. 

​

Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 22.2% in 2019 and 23.4% in 2018. Provision for income taxes in 2019 included excess tax benefits of $38.1 from stock option exercises, which was partially offset by the tax effects related to (i) acquisition-related expenses during the year and (ii) refinancing-related costs associated with the early extinguishment of debt. Provision for income taxes in 2018 included (i) excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises and (ii) an income tax benefit of $14.5 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, which were partially offset by the tax effect related to acquisition-related expenses during the year. These items had the aggregate effect of lowering the effective tax rate and increasing earnings per share by the amounts noted in the tables below. Excluding the effect of these items, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, was 24.5% and 25.5% for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

​

Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $1,155.0 and $3.75, respectively, for 2019, compared to $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,150.4 and $3.74, respectively, for 2019, compared to $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018.

​

The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)While the terms “operating margin” and “effective tax rate” are not considered U.S. GAAP financial measures, for purposes of this table, we derive the reported (GAAP) measures based on GAAP results, which serve as the basis for the reconciliation to their comparable non-GAAP financial measure.

​

2018 Compared to 2017

​

Net sales were $8,202.0 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $7,011.3 for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 17% in both U.S. dollars and constant currencies and 14% organically (excluding both currency and acquisition impacts) over the prior year. Net sales in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment (approximately 95% of net sales) increased 18% in U.S. dollars, 17% in constant currencies and 14% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The sales growth was driven by growth in the mobile devices, industrial, automotive, information technology and data communications, military, mobile networks and commercial aerospace markets, partially offset by a slight decline in sales into the broadband communications market, with growth resulting primarily from organic strength, in addition to contributions from the Company’s acquisitions. Net sales to the mobile devices market increased (approximately $403.6) primarily due to growth in sales of products incorporated into smartphones and related accessories, partially offset by declining sales of products incorporated into tablets. Net sales to 

26 
the industrial market increased (approximately $214.9), reflecting sales strength in medical, heavy equipment, electric vehicle, railway and mass transit, and oil and gas, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the automotive market increased (approximately $184.9), driven by growth and expansion in most regions of the global automotive market, as well as contributions from acquisitions. Net sales to the information technology and data communications market increased (approximately $166.1), reflecting organic growth in products for data centers, including server and networking-related applications, storage, and consumer electronics. Net sales to the military market increased (approximately $133.2), driven by broad strength across the market including increased sales into avionics, military communications and military airframe applications, as well as missile applications. Net sales to the mobile networks market increased (approximately $56.3), due to increased sales to both mobile networks equipment manufacturers and mobile operators. Net sales to the commercial aerospace market increased (approximately $39.6) primarily due to strength in large passenger planes. Net sales in the Cable Products and Solutions segment (approximately 5% of net sales), which primarily serves the broadband communications market, increased 4% in U.S. dollars, 6% in constant currencies and 6% organically in 2018, compared to 2017. The increase in the Cable Products and Solutions segment was primarily due to an increase in cable products sold into the mobile networks market, which was partially offset by the slight decrease in sales into the broadband communications market.

​

The table below reconciles Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures, by segment and consolidated, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017:

(2)Foreign currency translation impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from foreign currency exchange rate changes in the current year compared to the prior year. Such amount is calculated by subtracting current year net sales translated at average foreign currency exchange rates for the respective prior year from current year reported net sales, taken as a percentage of the respective prior year’s net sales.

(3)Constant Currency Net Sales Growth and Organic Net Sales Growth are non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section.

(4)Acquisition impact, a non-GAAP measure, represents the impact on net sales resulting from acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. 

​

Geographically, net sales in the United States in 2018 increased approximately 13% in U.S. dollars ($2,241.4 in 2018 versus $1,978.4 in 2017) and 9% organically, compared to 2017. Foreign sales in 2018 increased approximately 18% in U.S. dollars ($5,960.6 in 2018 versus $5,032.9 in 2017), 17% in constant currencies and 15% organically, compared to 2017 with strength in both Asia and Europe. The comparatively slightly weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 had an insignificant effect on net sales compared to 2017.

​

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $959.5 or 11.7% of net sales for 2018, compared to $878.3 or 12.5% of net sales for 2017. Administrative expenses increased approximately $46.4 in 2018 primarily related to increases in employee-related benefits and stock-based compensation expense, and represented approximately 4.7% of net sales in 2018 and 4.8% of net sales in 2017. Research and development expenses increased approximately $27.2 in 2018 primarily related to increases in expenses for new product development and represented approximately 2.7% of net sales in 2018 and 2.8% of net sales in 2017. Selling and marketing expenses increased approximately $7.6 in 2018 primarily related to the increase in sales volume and represented approximately 4.3% of net sales in 2018 and 4.9% of net sales in 2017.

​

Operating income was $1,686.9 or 20.6% of net sales in 2018, compared to $1,427.6 or 20.4% of net sales in 2017. Operating income for 2018 and 2017 includes acquisition-related expenses of $8.5 and $4.0, respectively, related to external transaction costs. These acquisition-related expenses are separately presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Excluding the effect of these acquisition-related expenses, Adjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, were $1,695.4 or 20.7% of net sales in 2018 

27 
and $1,431.6 or 20.4% in 2017. The increase in Adjusted Operating Margin for 2018 compared to 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in operating margin for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. Operating income for the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment in 2018 was $1,752.5 or 22.5% of net sales, compared to $1,475.2 or 22.3% of net sales in 2017.  The increase in operating income margin was driven primarily by strong operating leverage on higher sales volumes. In addition, the operating income for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 was $52.6 or 12.5% of net sales, compared to $54.2 or 13.4% of net sales in 2017. The decrease in operating income margin for the Cable Products and Solutions segment in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily driven by increases in certain commodity costs.

​

Interest expense was $101.7 in 2018 compared to $92.3 in 2017. The increase was primarily due to higher average interest rates on the Company’s U.S. Commercial Paper Program (as defined below in this Item 7) and the senior note issuances in April 2017.

​

Provision for income taxes was at an effective rate of 23.4% in 2018 and 51.1% in 2017. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 resulted primarily from the Tax Act Charge of $398.5 recorded in 2017, which was partially offset by the excess tax benefits of $66.6 from stock option exercises. The effects of these items were significantly lower in 2018, as the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $14.5 in 2018 related to the completion of the accounting for the Tax Act Charge, along with the excess tax benefits of $19.8 from stock option exercises.  Excluding the effect of these items along with the effect of acquisition-related expenses in each respective year, the Adjusted Effective Tax Rate, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, was 25.5% and 26.5% for 2018 and 2017, respectively, as reconciled in the table below to the comparable effective tax rate based on GAAP results. For additional details related to the reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal tax rate and the Company’s effective tax rate for these years, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

​

Net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Net income per common share-Diluted (“Diluted EPS”) was $1,205.0 and $3.85, respectively, for 2018, compared to $650.5 and $2.06, respectively, for 2017. Excluding the effect of the aforementioned items, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation and Adjusted Diluted EPS, as defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below within this Item 7, were $1,177.9 and $3.77, respectively, for 2018, compared to $986.1 and $3.12, respectively, for 2017.

​

The following table reconciles Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Operating Margin, Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, Adjusted Effective Tax Rate and Adjusted Diluted EPS (all defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below) to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017:

Liquidity and Capital Resources

​

Liquidity and Cash Requirements

​

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $908.6 and $1,291.7, respectively. The vast majority of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is located outside of the United States.  

​

Prior to the Tax Act, the Company asserted its intention to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States all of its foreign earnings not otherwise distributed currently. For earnings occurring on or after January 1, 2018, the Tax Act’s change to a modified territorial tax system in the United States has significantly reduced the U.S. tax expense associated with the remittance of foreign earnings, among other changes. The Tax Act also imposed a one-time transition tax (“Transition Tax”) on all of the Company’s pre-2018 accumulated unremitted foreign earnings. As a result, on December 31, 2017, the Company recorded a provisional U.S. tax expense for the Transition Tax, which was adjusted and finalized in 2018. This Transition Tax on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries will be paid, net of applicable tax credits and deductions, in annual installments until 2025, as permitted under the Tax Act. 

​

As a result of the Tax Act, on December 31, 2017, the Company indicated an intention to repatriate most of its pre-2018 accumulated earnings and recorded the foreign and U.S. state and local tax costs related to the repatriation. The associated tax payments are due as the repatriations are made. On December 31, 2018, the Company indicated its intention to distribute certain 2018 foreign earnings and accrue foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate and indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2018 foreign earnings. The Company intends to distribute certain 2019 foreign earnings and has accrued foreign and U.S. state and local taxes, if applicable, on those earnings as appropriate as of December 31, 2019, and intends to indefinitely reinvest all remaining 2019 foreign earnings. The Company intends to evaluate certain post-2019 earnings for distribution, and accrue for those distributions where appropriate, and to indefinitely reinvest all other foreign earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $900, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.

 ​

The Company’s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow, our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand, the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the Euro Commercial Paper Program, and the Revolving Credit Facility (each as defined below in this Item 7). The Company believes that its cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment position on hand, ability to generate future cash flow from operations, availability under its credit facilities, and access to capital markets provide adequate liquidity to meet its obligations for at least the next twelve months.

​

The Company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures, product development activities, repurchases of its Common Stock, dividends, debt service, payments associated with the Transition Tax (which is payable in annual installments until 2025), taxes due upon the repatriation of foreign earnings (which will be payable upon the repatriation of such earnings), and funding of pension obligations. The Company’s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on the Company’s Senior Notes (including the 2.20% Senior Notes due in April 2020), Revolving Credit Facility, and Commercial Paper Programs (all as defined below). The Company may also use cash to fund all or part of the cost of acquisitions. The Company expects that capital expenditures in 2020 will be in a range of 3% to 4% of net sales.

Operating Activities

​

The ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of the Company’s fundamental financial strengths. Cash flow provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow”) was $1,502.3 for 2019 compared to $1,112.7 for 2018. The increase in Operating Cash Flow for 2019 is primarily related to a lower usage of cash related to the change in working capital. In addition, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 also reflected the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”, and together with its foreign plans, the “Plans”), while no such voluntary cash contribution to the U.S. Plans was made in 2019. Operating Cash Flow was $1,112.7 for 2018 compared to $1,144.2 for 2017. The decrease in Operating Cash Flow for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to (i) certain tax payments made, primarily in the first half of 2018, related to the Tax Act Charge of approximately $87.0, including the first annual installment of the Transition Tax of approximately $18 in the second quarter of 2018 and payments for foreign and U.S. state and local taxes of approximately $69 related to foreign cash repatriated during 2018 and (ii) the Company’s voluntary cash contribution of approximately $81.0 in the first quarter of 2018 to fund our U.S. Plans. Excluding these items, Operating Cash Flow in 2018 increased compared to 2017 primarily due to the increase in net income, which was partially offset by the higher usage of cash related to the change in working capital. 

​

In 2019, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $81.6, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to decreases in accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $129.3 and accounts payable of $60.2, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of $117.3. In 2018, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $362.4, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, primarily due to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $237.9, $173.3 and $47.7, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, including income taxes, of $48.8 and $47.7, respectively. In 2017, the components of working capital as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow increased $158.1, excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency translation, due primarily to increases in accounts receivable, inventories and other current assets of $146.5, $100.4 and $75.9, respectively, partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $140.5 and $24.2, respectively. 

​

The following describes the significant changes in the amounts as presented on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Accounts receivable decreased $55.4 to $1,736.4 primarily due to lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 as well as the effect of translation from exchange rate changes at December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018 (“Translation”), partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Days sales outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 73 days. Inventories increased $76.3 to $1,310.1, primarily due to the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by Translation. Inventory days at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were approximately 80 days and 74 days, respectively. Property, plant and equipment, net, increased $123.2 to $999.0, primarily due to capital expenditures of $295.0 and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by depreciation of $240.0, disposals and Translation. Goodwill increased $763.9 to $4,867.1 primarily as a result of goodwill recognized related to nine acquisitions that closed in 2019, partially offset by Translation. Other intangible assets, net increased $44.1 to $442.0 primarily due to the recognition of certain identifiable intangible assets of $111.8 related to the 2019 acquisitions, partially offset by amortization of $67.3. Other long-term assets increased $199.8 to $296.2 primarily due to the adoption of the new lease standard (“Topic 842”) described in Note 1 and Note 10 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which resulted in the recognition of $196.7 of operating lease right-of-use assets as of December 31, 2019. Accounts payable decreased $23.7 to $866.8, primarily due to less purchasing activity resulting from lower sales activity and Translation, partially offset by the impact of acquisitions. Payable days at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 53 days. Total accrued expenses, including accrued income taxes, increased $66.1 to $862.6, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $54.0 of current operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019, and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by certain tax payments. Other long-term liabilities, including deferred tax liabilities, increased $151.6 to $684.4, primarily as a result of the adoption of Topic 842, which resulted in the recognition of $145.4 of long-term operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

​

In 2019 and 2018, the Company made aggregate cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans of approximately $6.6 and $88.3, respectively, of which approximately $81.0 of the 2018 contributions related to the January 2018 voluntary cash contribution to fund our U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions 

30 
to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. 

​

In addition to Operating Cash Flow, the Company also considers Free Cash Flow, a non-GAAP financial measure defined in the “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section below, as a key metric in measuring the Company’s ability to generate cash. The following table reconciles Free Cash Flow to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. The increase in Free Cash Flow in 2019 compared to 2018 was driven by the increase in Operating Cash Flow, as described above. The decrease in Free Cash Flow in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily related to an increase in capital expenditures to support certain new customer programs, along with a modest decrease in Operating Cash Flow, as described above.

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Investing Activities

​

Cash flows from investing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with capital expenditures, proceeds from disposals of property, plant and equipment, sales and maturities (purchases) of short-term investments, net, and acquisitions. 

​

Net cash used in investing activities was $1,228.8 in 2019, compared to $441.8 in 2018 and $380.2 in 2017. In 2019, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $937.4 to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $287.6, and net purchases of short-term investments of $3.8. In 2018, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $305.6 and the use of $158.9 to fund acquisitions, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $22.7. In 2017, net cash used in investing activities was driven primarily by the use of $265.5 to fund acquisitions, along with capital expenditures (net of disposals) of $222.5, partially offset by net sales and maturities of short-term investments of $107.8. 

​

Financing Activities

​

Cash flows from financing activities consist primarily of cash flows associated with borrowings and repayments of the Company’s credit facilities and other long-term debt, repurchases of common stock, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, dividend payments, and distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests. 

​

Net cash used in financing activities was $648.4 in 2019, compared to $1,070.1 in 2018 and $140.1 in 2017. In 2019, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) the aggregate repayments of certain of the Company’s senior notes and other long-term debt (primarily the 2.55% U.S. Senior Notes due January 2019 and the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes in September 2019) of $1,111.5, (ii) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $601.7, (iii) dividend payments of $279.5, (iv) net repayments under the Company’s commercial paper programs of $229.0, (v) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $43.3, (vi) payments of costs of $14.9 related to debt financing primarily associated with the 2029 Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facility, and the 2030 Senior Notes (each as defined below), and (vii) premiums and fees paid of $13.4 related to the early extinguishment of the Tendered Notes, partially offset by (i) aggregate net cash proceeds from the issuances of the 2029 Senior Notes and the 2030 Senior Notes of $1,398.8 and (ii) cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $246.1. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $935.2, (ii) net repayments of commercial paper and other debt of $559.8, (iii) dividend payments of $253.7, (iv) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $18.2 and (v) payments of costs of $5.6 related to debt financing associated with the issuances of the Euro senior notes and Euro commercial paper program, partially offset by (i) net cash proceeds from the October 2018 issuance of the Euro senior notes of $571.7 and (ii) cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $130.7. In 2017, net cash used in financing activities was driven primarily by (i) repurchases of the Company’s common stock of $618.0, (ii) repayment of the Company’s 1.55% Senior Notes due September 2017 of $375.0, (iii) dividend payments of $205.0, (iv) distributions to and purchases of noncontrolling interests of $24.4, and (v) payments of costs of $5.2 related to debt financing associated with the issuances of two series of senior notes, partially offset by (i) borrowings related to the issuances of two series of senior notes in April 2017 of $749.3, (ii) net borrowings under the U.S. commercial paper program of $154.1, and (iii) cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $184.1.

​

The Company has significant flexibility to meet its financial commitments. The Company uses debt financing to lower the overall cost of capital and increase return on stockholders’ equity. The Company’s debt financing includes the use of the commercial paper programs, revolving credit facility and senior notes as part of its overall cash management strategy. 

​

On January 15, 2019, the Company amended its $2,000.0 unsecured credit facility with a $2,500.0 unsecured credit facility (“Revolving Credit Facility”). The Revolving Credit Facility, which matures January 2024, increases the lenders’ aggregate commitments by $500.0 and gives the Company the ability to borrow at a spread over LIBOR. The Company may utilize the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires payment of certain annual agency and commitment fees and requires that the Company satisfy certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Revolving Credit Facility.

 ​

The Company has a commercial paper program pursuant to which the Company issues short-term unsecured commercial paper notes in one or more private placements in the United States (the “U.S. Commercial Paper Program”). The amount of U.S. commercial paper notes outstanding (“USCP Notes”) as of December 31, 2019 was $160.0.

​

On July 10, 2018, the Company and one of its wholly owned European subsidiaries (the “Euro Issuer”) entered into a euro-commercial paper program (the “Euro Commercial Paper Program” and, together with the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, the “Commercial Paper Programs”) pursuant to which the Euro Issuer may issue short-term unsecured commercial paper notes (the “ECP Notes” and, together with the USCP Notes, the “Commercial Paper”), which are guaranteed by the Company and are to be issued outside of the United States. The ECP Notes may be issued in Euros, Sterling, U.S. Dollars or other currencies. The amount of ECP Notes outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was €210.0 (approximately $235.5). 

Amounts available under the Commercial Paper Programs may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to time. As of December 31, 2019, the authorization from the Company’s Board of Directors limits the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes, ECP Notes, and any other commercial paper, euro-commercial paper or similar programs at any time to $2,500.0, consistent with the Revolving Credit Facility. In addition, the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of USCP Notes at any time is $2,500.0, while the maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of ECP Notes at any time is $2,000.0.  The Commercial Paper Programs are rated A-2 by Standard & Poor’s and P-2 by Moody’s and are currently backstopped by the Revolving Credit Facility, as amounts undrawn under the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility are available to repay Commercial Paper, if necessary. Net proceeds of the issuances of Commercial Paper are expected to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company reviews its optimal mix of short-term and long-term debt regularly and may replace certain amounts of Commercial Paper, short-term debt and current maturities of long-term debt with new issuances of long-term debt in the future.

​

As of December 31, 2019, the Company has outstanding senior notes (the “Senior Notes”) as follows:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The U.S. Senior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Company’s other unsecured senior indebtedness. Interest on each series of the U.S. Senior Notes is payable semiannually. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of any series of U.S. Senior Notes, subject to certain terms and conditions. The 2.20% Senior Notes are due in April 2020 and are therefore recorded, net of the related unamortized discount and debt issuance costs, within Current portion of long-term debt in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019.

​

On January 9, 2019, the Company issued $500.0 principal amount of unsecured 4.350% Senior Notes due June 1, 2029 at 99.904% of face value (the “2029 Senior Notes”), the net proceeds of which were used, along with proceeds 

32 
from borrowings under the U.S. Commercial Paper Program, to repay the $750.0 of the Company’s 2.55% Senior Notes due in January 2019.

​

On September 4, 2019, the Company commenced tender offers (“Tender Offers”) to purchase for cash any and all of the Company’s outstanding (i) $375.0 principal amount of its 3.125% Senior Notes due September 2021 (“2021 Senior Notes”) and (ii) $500.0 principal amount of its 4.00% Senior Notes due February 2022 (“2022 Senior Notes”). On September 11, 2019, as a result of the Tender Offers, the Company accepted for payment $147.3 aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Senior Notes and $205.0 aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Senior Notes for 101.9% and 104.5% of par value, respectively (collectively, the “Tendered Notes”), plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the settlement date of the Tender Offers. The total consideration for the Tendered Notes was $368.8, which in addition to the Tendered Notes, included $13.4 of premiums and fees paid related to the early extinguishment of debt and $3.1 of accrued interest. The remaining principal amounts associated with the 2021 Senior Notes and 2022 Senior Notes, which were not redeemed as a result of the Tender Offers, remain outstanding as of December 31, 2019. 

​

On September 10, 2019, the Company issued $900.0 principal amount of unsecured 2.800% Senior Notes due February 15, 2030 at 99.920% of face value (the “2030 Senior Notes”). In September 2019, the Company used the net proceeds from the 2030 Senior Notes to fund the cash consideration payable in the Tender Offers, with the remaining net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes, including to partially reduce outstanding borrowings related to the U.S. Commercial Paper Program. 

​

On October 8, 2018, the Euro Issuer issued €500.0 (approximately $574.6 at date of issuance) principal amount of unsecured 2.000% Senior Notes due October 8, 2028 at 99.498% of face value (the “2028 Euro Notes”, and collectively with the Senior Notes in the United States, “Senior Notes”). The 2028 Euro Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with the Euro Issuer’s other unsecured senior indebtedness, and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Company. Interest on the 2028 Euro Notes is payable annually on October 8 of each year, commencing on October 8, 2019. The Company may, at its option, redeem some or all of the 2028 Euro Notes at any time, subject to certain terms and conditions.  The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2028 Euro Notes to repay a portion of the outstanding amounts under its Commercial Paper Programs, with the remainder of the net proceeds being used for general corporate purposes. 

​

The Company’s Senior Notes contain certain financial and non-financial covenants. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under its Senior Notes. Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Company’s debt.

​

In April 2018, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase up to $2,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the three-year period ending April 24, 2021 (the “2018 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company repurchased 6.5 million and 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $601.7 and $553.2, respectively, under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. Of the total repurchases in 2019, 5.5 million shares, or $514.1, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 1.0 million shares, or $87.6, were retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase. Of the total repurchases in 2018, 5.7 million shares, or $498.2, have been retired by the Company; the remaining 0.7 million shares, or $55.0, had been retained in Treasury stock at time of repurchase. From January 1, 2020 through January 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 0.3 million additional shares of its Common Stock for $29.0, leaving $816.1 available to purchase under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program. The price and timing of any future purchases under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program will depend on factors such as levels of cash generation from operations, the volume of stock option exercises by employees, cash requirements for acquisitions, dividends, economic and market conditions and stock price. 

​

In January 2017, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which the Company could purchase up to $1,000.0 of the Company’s Common Stock during the two-year period ending January 24, 2019 (the “2017 Stock Repurchase Program”) in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. During the three months ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased 4.2 million shares of its Common Stock for $382.0, while during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 8.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $618.0. These shares have been retired by the Company. These repurchases of 12.6 million shares for $1,000.0 completed the 2017 Stock Repurchase Program. The repurchases in the first quarter of 2018, coupled with the Company’s repurchase of 6.4 million shares of its Common Stock for $553.2 under the 2018 Stock Repurchase Program 

33 
during the nine months ended December 31, 2018, resulted in total repurchases of 10.6 million shares for $935.2 during the year ended December 31, 2018.

​

Contingent upon declaration by the Board of Directors, the Company generally pays a quarterly dividend on shares of its Common Stock. On July 23, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase to its quarterly dividend rate from $0.23 to $0.25 per share effective with dividends declared in the third quarter of 2019. The following table summarizes the declared quarterly dividends per share for each of the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017:

​

LIBOR Transition

​

In July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced its intent to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred benchmark alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR. Published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, SOFR represents a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is calculated based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of LIBOR (which ultimately may or may not be SOFR), from both a risk management and financial reporting perspective, including the review of potential issues that might arise in connection with this transition. Our current portfolio of debt and financial instruments tied to LIBOR consists primarily of our Commercial Paper Programs and Revolving Credit Facility, the latter of which has no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2019. Due to our current limited reliance on borrowings tied to LIBOR, the Company does not believe that this transition will have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

​

Pensions

​

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries in the United States have defined benefit pension plans (“U.S. Plans”), which cover certain U.S. employees and which represent the majority of the plan assets and benefit obligations of the aggregate defined benefit plans of the Company. The U.S. Plans’ benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory. Certain U.S. employees not covered by the U.S. Plans are covered by defined contribution plans. Certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees (the “Foreign Plans” and, together with the U.S. Plans, the “Plans”). The total liability for accrued pension and postretirement benefit obligations under the Company’s pension and postretirement benefit plans increased in 2019 to $184.8 from $178.5 in 2018 primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates on our projected benefit obligation, which was partially offset by higher actual returns on plan assets. In 2018, the Company also made a voluntary cash contribution of $81.0 to fund the U.S. Plans. There is no current requirement for cash contributions to any of the U.S. Plans, and the Company plans to evaluate annually, based on actuarial calculations and the investment performance of the Plans’ assets, the timing and amount of cash contributions in the future. 

​

Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the Company’s benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans.

​

34 
Acquisitions

​

In January 2019, the Company acquired SSI Controls Technologies (“SSI”), the sensor manufacturing division of SSI Technologies, Inc., for approximately $400, net of cash acquired, plus a performance-related contingent payment. The acquisition of SSI was funded by cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. SSI, which is headquartered in the state of Wisconsin in the United States, is a leading designer and manufacturer of sensors and sensing solutions for the global automotive and industrial markets. 

​

During 2019, the Company completed nine acquisitions (including SSI) for $937.4, net of cash acquired. All but one of the acquisitions are included in the Interconnect Products and Assemblies segment. These acquisitions were not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.

​

Environmental Matters

​

Certain operations of the Company are subject to environmental laws and regulations which govern the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, as well as the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. The Company believes that its operations are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that the costs of continuing compliance will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

​

Inflation and Costs

​

The cost of the Company’s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials. The Company strives to offset the impact of increases in the cost of raw materials, labor and services through price increases, productivity improvements and cost saving programs. However, in certain markets, particularly in communications related markets, implementing price increases can be difficult and there is no guarantee that the Company will be successful. For a discussion of certain risks related to inflation and costs, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company has at times experienced difficulties in obtaining a consistent supply of materials at stable pricing levels” in Part I, Item 1A herein.

​

Foreign Exchange

​

The Company conducts business in many foreign currencies through its worldwide operations, and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposure due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies including possible currency devaluations. Changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively affect the Company’s sales, operating margins and equity. The Company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk in a number of ways including producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold, thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency, cost reduction and pricing actions, working capital management and hedging contracts. However, there can be no assurance that these actions will be fully effective in managing currency risk, including in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies of the Company’s worldwide operations. For further discussion of foreign exchange exposures, risks and uncertainties, refer to the risk factor titled “The Company’s results have at times been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates” in Part I, Item 1A herein.

​

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

​

In addition to assessing the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management utilizes certain non-GAAP financial measures defined below as part of its internal reviews for purposes of monitoring, evaluating and forecasting the Company’s financial performance, communicating operating results to the Company's Board of Directors and assessing related employee compensation measures. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures may be helpful to investors in assessing the Company’s overall financial performance, trends and year-over-year comparative results, in addition to the reasons noted below. Non-GAAP financial measures related to operating income, operating margin, net income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, effective tax rate and diluted EPS exclude income and expenses that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Items excluded in such non-GAAP financial measures in any period may consist of, without limitation, acquisition-related expenses, refinancing-related costs, and certain discrete tax items including but not limited to (i) the excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation and (ii) the impact of significant changes in tax law (including the Tax Act Charge recorded in 2017 and the subsequent adjustment 

35 
recorded in 2018 related to this charge). Non-GAAP financial measures related to net sales exclude the impact related to foreign currency exchange and acquisitions. The non-GAAP financial information contained herein is included for supplemental purposes only and should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for or superior to the related U.S. GAAP financial measures. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not necessarily the same or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies, as such measures may be calculated differently or may exclude different items. 

​

The non-GAAP financial measures defined below should be read in conjunction with the Company’s financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 are included in “Results of Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources” within this Item 7: 

​

●Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as diluted earnings per share (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), excluding income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company's operating performance during the years presented. Adjusted Diluted EPS is calculated as Adjusted Net Income attributable to Amphenol Corporation, as defined below, divided by the weighted average outstanding diluted shares as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

​

●Adjusted Effective Tax Rate is defined as Provision for income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, expressed as a percentage of Income before income taxes, as reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income, each excluding the income and expenses and their specific tax effects that are not directly related to the Company’s operating performance during the years presented.

​

​

●Free Cash Flow is defined as Net cash provided by operating activities (“Operating Cash Flow” - as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP) less capital expenditures (as reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP), both of which are derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. Free Cash Flow is an important liquidity measure for the Company, as we believe it is useful for management and investors to assess our ability to generate cash, as well as to assess how much cash can be used to reinvest in the growth of the Company or to return to shareholders through either stock repurchases or dividends.

​

●Organic Net Sales Growth is defined as the year-over-year percentage change in net sales growth resulting from operating volume and pricing changes, and excludes the impact of 1) changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which directly impact the Company’s operating results and are outside the control of the Company and 2) acquisitions closed since the beginning of the prior calendar year, which were not included in the Company’s results as of the comparable prior year periods and which do not reflect the underlying growth of the Company on a comparative basis. Management evaluates the Company’s sales performance based on actual sales growth in U.S. dollars, as well as Constant Currency Net Sales Growth (defined above) and Organic Net Sales Growth, and believes that such information is useful to investors to assess the underlying sales trends.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

​

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management bases its estimates on historical experience along with other assumptions that we believe are reasonable in formulating our bases for making judgements regarding the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent elsewhere. Estimates are adjusted as new information becomes available. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes that the most significant areas involving critical accounting policies are set forth below. The significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Notes to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

Revenue Recognition 

​

Topic 606

​

The Company’s net sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 are presented under Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (collectively with its related subsequent amendments, “Topic 606”), resulting from the modified retrospective adoption of Topic 606 applied to those contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018. The comparative results for the year ended December 31, 2017 were recognized in accordance with the Company’s revenue recognition policy then in effect under ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition (“Topic 605”), as discussed below. The adoption of Topic 606 resulted in accounting policy changes surrounding revenue recognition which replaced previous revenue guidance under Topic 605. 

​

The Company’s primary source of revenues consist of product sales to either end customers and their appointed contract manufacturers (including original equipment manufacturers) or to distributors. Our revenues are derived from contracts with customers, which in most cases are customer purchase orders that may be governed by master sales agreements. For each contract, the promise to transfer the control of the products, each of which is individually distinct, is considered to be the identified performance obligation. As part of the consideration promised in each contract, the Company evaluates the customer’s credit risk. Our contracts do not have any significant financing components, as payment terms are generally due net 30 to 120 days after delivery. Although products are almost always sold at fixed prices, in determining the transaction price, we evaluate whether the price is subject to refund (due to returns) or adjustment (due to volume discounts, rebates, or price concessions) to determine the net consideration we expect to be entitled to. We allocate the transaction price to each distinct product based on its relative standalone selling price. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities and collected from the customer, including but not limited to sales and use taxes and value-added taxes, are not included in the transaction price. 

​

The vast majority of our sales are recognized at a point-in-time under the core principle of recognizing revenue when control transfers to the customer, which generally occurs when we ship or deliver the product from our manufacturing facility to our customers, when our customer accepts and has legal title of the goods, and where the Company has a present right to payment for such goods. Based on the respective contract terms, most of our contracts’ revenues are recognized either (i) upon shipment based on free on board (“FOB”) shipping point, (ii) when the product arrives at its destination or (iii) when the products are pulled from consignment inventory. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, less than 5% of our net sales were recognized over time, where the associated contracts relate to the sale of goods with no alternative use as they are only sold to a single customer and whose underlying contract terms provide the Company with an enforceable right to payment, including a reasonable profit margin, for performance completed to date, in the event of customer termination. For the contracts recognized over time, we typically record revenue using the input method, based on the materials and labor costs incurred to date relative to the contract’s total estimated costs. This method reasonably depicts when and as control of the goods transfers to the customer, since it measures our progress in producing the goods which is generally commensurate with this transfer of 

37 
control. Since we typically invoice our customers at the same time that we satisfy our performance obligations, contract assets and contract liabilities related to our contracts with customers recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. 

​

Pre-adoption of Topic 606

​

For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue from sales of the Company’s products was recognized at the time the goods were delivered, title passed and the risks and rewards of ownership passed to the customer, provided the earnings process was complete and revenue was measurable. Such recognition generally occurred when the products reached the shipping point, the sales price was fixed and determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Delivery was determined by the Company’s shipping terms, which was primarily freight on board shipping point. Revenue was recorded at the net amount to be received after deductions for estimated discounts, allowances and returns. These estimates and reserves were determined and adjusted as needed based upon historical experience, contract terms and other related factors.

​

Income Taxes

​

Deferred income taxes are provided for revenue and expenses which are recognized in different periods for income tax and financial statement reporting purposes. The Company recognizes the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on deferred income taxes in the period in which legislation is enacted. Deferred income taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the period in which the Company determines it no longer intends to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has not provided for deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings related to certain geographies of approximately $900, as it is the Company’s intention to permanently reinvest such earnings outside the United States. It is impracticable to calculate the amount of taxes that would be payable if these undistributed foreign earnings were to be repatriated.  In addition, the Company remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries. It is not practicable to determine the deferred tax liability with respect to such basis differences. Deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for recoverability based on both historical and anticipated earnings levels and a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that these amounts will not be recovered. The tax effects of an uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if it is “more likely than not” to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on its technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  The Company includes estimated interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes. 

​

As a result of the Tax Act, in 2017, the Company recorded (i) a provisional income tax charge related to the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries, (ii) a provisional income tax charge related to changes in the Company’s permanent reinvestment assertion with regards to prior accumulated unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by (iii) a provisional income tax benefit associated with the remeasurement of its net deferred tax liabilities due to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate reduction, and included these amounts in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning in 2018, the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision imposed a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for GILTI as a period cost. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued final interpretive guidance relating to certain provisions of the Tax Act and proposed additional guidance related to the same provisions. The Company will account for the impact of additional guidance in the period in which any new guidance is released, if appropriate.

​

In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which was codified under ASU 2018-05, to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. In 2017, the Company recorded a provisional income tax charge as a result of the Tax Act. Consistent with ASU 2018-05, the Company completed its accounting and recorded an income tax benefit in 2018.

Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments

​

The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2019, as well as an estimate of the timing in which such obligations are expected to be satisfied.

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The Company has excluded expected interest payments on the Revolving Credit Facility, U.S. Commercial Paper Program and Euro Commercial Paper Program from the above table, as this calculation is largely dependent on average debt levels the Company expects to have during each of the years presented. The actual interest payments made related to the Company’s Revolving Credit Facility and both Commercial Paper Programs combined, in 2019, were approximately $22.1. Expected debt levels, and therefore expected interest payments, are difficult to predict, as they are significantly impacted by such items as future acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, dividend payments as well as payments or additional borrowings made to reduce or increase the underlying revolver balance.

​

(2)The Company’s operating lease payments included in this table reflect the future minimum undiscounted fixed lease payments, which serve as the basis for calculating the Company’s operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2019. The table above excludes any variable lease payments not included in the measurement of the Company’s right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 842, due to their uncertainty. Finance leases are not material to the Company individually or in the aggregate and as such, have been excluded from the table above. 

​

(3)Purchase obligations relate primarily to open purchase orders for goods and services, including but not limited to, raw materials and components to be used in production.

​

(4)Included in this table are estimated benefit payments expected to be made under the Company’s unfunded pension and postretirement benefit plans, as well as the anticipated minimum required contributions under the Company’s funded pension plans, the most significant funded plan of which covers its U.S. employees. Over the past several years, there has been no minimum requirement for Company contributions to the U.S. Plans due to prior contributions made in excess of minimum requirements and as a result, there was no anticipated minimum required contribution included in the table above related to the U.S. Plans for 2020. However, the Company did make a voluntary contribution of approximately $81.0 in 2018 to fund the U.S. Plans, while no such voluntary contribution was made in 2019. It is not possible to reasonably estimate expected required contributions in the above table after 2020 since several assumptions are required to calculate minimum required contributions, such as the discount rate and expected returns on pension assets.

​

(5)As a result of the enactment of the Tax Act in December 2017, the Company recorded a provisional tax charge on the deemed repatriation of the accumulated unremitted earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries (“Transition Tax”) for the year ended December 31, 2017, based on certain assumptions made upon the Company’s then current interpretation of the Tax Act.  The Company analyzed guidance and technical interpretations issued in 2018 related to the provisions of the Tax Act, and refined, analyzed and updated the underlying data, computations and assumptions used to prepare the provisional amount, and consequently completed its accounting and recorded an adjustment related to the Transition Tax. The amounts noted in the table above reflect the final Transition Tax, which is net of applicable tax credits and deductions, and in accordance with the Tax Act, is to be paid over the eight year period starting in 2018. The second installment of the Transition Tax was paid in the second quarter of 2019. 

​

(6)As of December 31, 2019, the Company has recorded net liabilities of approximately $183.5 related to unrecognized tax benefits. These liabilities have been excluded from the above table due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows; it is difficult to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which all of these liabilities might be paid.
