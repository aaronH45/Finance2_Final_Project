Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated ("Leggett & Platt," "Company," "we," "us" or "our") was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes and automobiles. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 15 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Products; Industrial Products; Furniture Products; and Specialized Products.

See the discussion on page 8 which provides a revised segment structure of the Company effective as of January 1, 2020.

 Overview of Our Segments

Residential Products Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

  1 Formed January 2019 with the acquisition of ECS

Our Residential Products segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coil bedsprings. Today, we supply a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products, as well as produce private-label finished mattresses for bedding brands and retailers. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component and finished product needs. We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, hard surface flooring underlayment, fabric, and geo components.

Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses. We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting end-consumer needs. We believe we attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production. Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products. 

 In January 2019, we completed the acquisition of ECS for cash consideration of approximately $1.25 billion. ECS, headquartered in Newnan, Georgia, is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and

furniture industries. With 16 facilities across the United States, ECS operates a vertically-integrated model, developing many of the chemicals and additives used in foam production, producing specialty foam, and manufacturing private-label finished products. These innovative specialty foam products include finished mattresses sold through both traditional and online channels, mattress components, mattress toppers and pillows, and furniture foams. ECS has a diversified customer mix and a strong position in the high-growth compressed mattress market segment.

CUSTOMERS 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2017 and 2018 our Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses underperformed expectations primarily from weaker demand and higher raw material costs. Accordingly, we began to exit low margin business, reduce operating costs and eliminate excess capacity. In 2018, we incurred restructuring-related charges of $16 million ($7 million cash and $9 million non-cash) primarily attributable to the Fashion Bed and Home Furniture businesses. In 2019, we incurred an additional $15 million ($8 million cash and $7 million non-cash) in restructuring-related charges primarily attributable to these businesses. The restructuring activity was substantially complete by the end of 2019, including the closure of the Fashion Bed business.

Specialized Products Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our Specialized Products segment designs, manufactures and sells products including automotive comfort and convenience components, tubing and fabricated assemblies for the aerospace industry, and hydraulic cylinders for the material handling, construction and transportation industries. In our automotive business, our technical capability and deep customer engagement allows us to compete on critical functionality, such as comfort, size, weight and noise. We believe our reliable product development and launch capability, coupled with our global footprint, makes us a trusted partner for our Tier 1 and OEM customers.

Revised Segment Structure

Our reportable segments are the same as our operating segments, which also correspond with our management organizational structure. To reflect how we manage our newly aligned businesses and in conjunction with the change in executive officer leadership, our management organizational structure and all related internal reporting changed effective January 1, 2020. As a result, our segment reporting will change to reflect the new structure beginning with our 2020 first quarter 10-Q. The modified structure will consist of three segments, seven business groups, and 15 business units organized as follows: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The new segment consists of the Residential Products and Industrial Products segments, plus the current Consumer Products Group (which is renamed the Adjustable Bed business unit), minus the Fabric & Flooring Products Group (which is renamed the Flooring & Textile Products Group)

2 The new segment consists of the Furniture Products segment, plus the Fabric & Flooring Products Group (which is renamed the Flooring & Textile Products Group) minus the Consumer Products Group (which is renamed the Adjustable Bed business unit).

Strategic Direction

Primary Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is a primary financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through an approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases. 

Our incentive programs reward return and cash generation, and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 300 peers). 

For information about our TSR targets, see the discussion under "Total Shareholder Return" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 29. 

Disciplined Growth

The expected long-term contribution to TSR from revenue growth is 6-9%. Over the last three years, we generated combined unit volume and acquisition growth of 7% per year on average. We also benefited slightly from commodity inflation, resulting in total revenue growth of 8% per year on average.

8
PART I

We will continue to make investments to support expansion in current businesses and product lines where sales are growing profitably. We also envision periodic acquisitions that add capabilities in these businesses or provide opportunities to enter more diverse, faster-growing, and higher margin markets. We expect all acquisitions to have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in attractive and growing markets.

Returning Cash to Shareholders

During the past three years, we generated $1.55 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends ($584 million) and share repurchases ($286 million). Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. Historically, after funding those priorities, we generally repurchased stock with remaining available cash. Currently, because of the debt level increases in connection with the ECS acquisition, we expect to focus instead on deleveraging by temporarily limiting share repurchases, controlling the pace of acquisition spending, and using operating cash flow to repay debt.

For information about dividends and share repurchases, see the discussion under "Pay Dividends" and "Repurchase Stock" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 43. 

Acquisitions

2019

 In January 2019, we completed the acquisition of ECS for cash consideration of approximately $1.25 billion. ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. ECS operates a vertically-integrated model, developing many of the chemicals and additives used in foam production, producing specialty foam, and manufacturing private-label finished products. These innovative specialty foam products include finished mattresses sold through both traditional and online channels, mattress components, mattress toppers and pillows, and furniture foams. ECS operates as a new business unit titled Specialty Foam within the Residential Products segment.

In December 2019, we acquired a manufacturer and distributor of a wide range of geosynthetic fabrics, grids and erosion control products for cash consideration of approximately $21 million. The acquisition is reported in our Geo Components business unit within the Residential Products segment.

2018

 In January 2018, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders (PHC), a leading global manufacturer of

engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. The total consideration paid was $87 million. PHC serves a market of mainly large OEM customers utilizing highly engineered components with long product life-cycles that represent a small part of the end product’s cost. PHC represents a new growth platform and formed a new business group titled Hydraulic Cylinders within the Specialized Products segment.

 We also acquired two small Geo Components businesses for total consideration of $22 million. They manufacture and distribute silt fencing and home and garden products.

2017

We acquired three businesses and the remaining interest in a joint venture for total consideration (including cash and stock) of $56 million. The first was a Canadian geosynthetic products distributor and installer for civil engineering and construction applications. The second was a U.S.-based surface-critical bent tube manufacturer supporting our private-label seating strategy in Work Furniture. We also acquired a U.S. manufacturer of rebond carpet cushion. Finally, we acquired the remaining 20% ownership in an Asian joint venture in our Work Furniture business. 

For more information regarding our acquisitions, please refer to Note S on page 117 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Divestitures and Discontinued Operations

There were no divestitures in 2019 or 2018. In 2017, we divested our final Commercial Vehicle Products (CVP) business for total consideration of $9 million, and it did not meet the discontinued operations criteria. This business unit was engaged in the manufacture of van interiors, including the racks, shelving and cabinets installed in service vans. Also, in 2017, we completed the sale of real estate formerly associated with this operation, realizing a pretax gain of $23 million.

For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note C on page 80 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Foreign Operations

The percentages of our trade sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below. Sales by ECS (acquired in January 2019) are not included in 2017 and 2018 in the table below. Substantially all ECS sales are in the United States.

 2017 - 37% ; 2018 - 37% ; 2019 - 34% 

Our international operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico. Our products in these foreign locations primarily consist of:

Geographic Areas of Operation

As of December 31, 2019, we had 140 manufacturing facilities; 87 located in the U.S. and 53 located in 17 foreign countries, as shown below. We also had various sales, warehouse and administrative facilities. However, our manufacturing plants are our most important properties.

Sales by Product Line

The following table shows our approximate percentage of trade sales by product line for the last three years: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 The Company acquired ECS, a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries, in January 2019.

2  Formed in January 2018 with the acquisition of a manufacturer of hydraulic cylinders.

3 The remaining Commercial Vehicle Products operation was sold in 2017.

Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.

Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture innersprings and foundations for mattresses.

We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire. 

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2019, our largest customer accounted for approximately 5% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for 

12
PART I

approximately 34% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Products, Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 

Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2019. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations as a whole. Substantially all of our patents relate to products manufactured by the Specialized Products, Furniture Products, and Residential Products segments, while over half of our trademarks relate to products manufactured by the Residential Products segment. 

1,534 patents issued, 600 patents in process, 1,036 trademarks registered, 114 trademarks in process 

The above patents and trademarks include intellectual property acquired with ECS in January 2019 related to the protection of technology around various foam applications. These include specialty polyols and additives that enhance foam performance by reducing heat retention, improving durability and diminishing odor. 

Some of our most significant trademarks include:

Product Development

One of our strongest performing product categories across the Company is ComfortCore®, our fabric-encased innerspring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses. Our ComfortCore® volume continues to grow, and represented over 55% of our U.S. innerspring units in 2019. A growing number of our ComfortCore® innersprings contain a feature we call Quantum® Edge. These are narrow-diameter, fabric-encased coils that form a perimeter around an innerspring set, replacing a rigid foam perimeter in a finished mattress. In 2019, over 45% of our ComfortCore® innersprings in the U.S. had the Quantum® Edge feature, and Quantum® Edge continues to grow. 

  With the January 2019 acquisition of ECS, we gained important proprietary technologies in the production of specialty foams, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. ECS formulates many of the chemicals and additives used in foam production. These branded, specialty polyols and additives enhance foam performance by reducing heat retention, improving durability and diminishing odor. These innovations enable us to create quality mattresses that can be compressed, and we have a significant amount of intellectual property around these specialty chemical formulations.

Many of our other businesses are engaged in product development activities to protect our market position and support ongoing growth. 

Employees

At December 31, 2019, we had approximately 22,000 employees, of which 15,700 were engaged in production. Approximately 12,000 were international employees (5,200 in China). Also, 16% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2019. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2020. 

7,100 Residential, 7,900 Specialized, 4,800 Furniture, 1,100 Industrial, 900 Corporate/Other

At December 31, 2018, we also had approximately 22,000 employees.

Competition

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors 

14
PART I

try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. 

We believe we are the largest U.S.-based manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We continue to face competitive pressure as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products from low cost countries. In addition to lower labor rates, competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, automation, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. 

For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring, steel wire rod and mattress imports, please see "Competition" in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 30.

Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year such as inflation and deflation, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, our operating cash flows are stronger in the fourth quarter primarily related to the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors. 

Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.

Working Capital Items

We are not required to carry significant amounts of inventory to meet rapid delivery requirements of customers or to assure ourselves a continuous allotment of goods from suppliers. In addition, we have not provided rights to return merchandise or extended payment terms to customers where those activities could have a material impact on our business. For additional information regarding working capital items, please see the discussion of "Cash from Operations" in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 40.

Government Contracts

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.

15
PART I

Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies or unexpected operational or other developments, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
