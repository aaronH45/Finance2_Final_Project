Interest Rates

The table below provides information about the Company’s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was approximately $99 million greater than carrying value at December 31, 2019 and approximately $35 million less than carrying value at December 31, 2018. The fair value of fixed rate debt was calculated using a Bloomberg secondary market rate, as of December 31, 2019 for similar remaining maturities, plus an estimated “spread” over such Treasury securities representing the Company’s interest costs for its notes. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.
