Item 7A: Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Grainger's primary market risk exposures as follows: 

Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

Grainger’s financial results, including the value of assets and liabilities, are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk when the financial statements of the business units outside the U.S., as stated in their local currencies, are translated into U.S. dollars. Grainger's net earnings exposure to foreign currency exchange rates was not material for 2019. 

Interest Rate Risks

Grainger is exposed to interest rate risk on its variable-rate debt used to fund international businesses (See Note 7 to the Financial Statements) and it does not currently use any derivative instruments to manage these exposures. As of December 31, 2019, the annualized effect of a 0.1 percentage point increase in interest rates on Grainger’s variable-rate debt obligations would not have a material impact on net earnings.

Commodity Price Risk

Grainger’s transportation costs are exposed to fluctuations in the price of fuel and some sourced products contain commodity-priced materials. The Company regularly monitors commodity trends and, as a broadline supplier, mitigates any material exposure to commodity price risk by having alternative sourcing plans in place that mitigate the risk of supplier concentration, passing commodity-related inflation to customers or suppliers, and continuing to scale its distribution networks, including its transportation infrastructure.
