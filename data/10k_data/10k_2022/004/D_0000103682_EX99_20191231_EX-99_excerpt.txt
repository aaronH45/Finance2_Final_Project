Exhibit 99  

4th Quarter 2019  

Earnings Release  

Kit  

As revised on  

February 28, 2020¹  

 ¹  

As a result of developments subsequent to the Fourth Quarter 2019 earnings call and release of the Earnings Release Kit on February 11, 2020, Dominion Energy increased certain litigation reserves acquired in the SCANA Merger by $120 million ($90 million after-tax). The change impacted GAAP reported earnings for the fourth quarter and the full-year of 2019 but had no impact on operating earnings during the same periods. The revision also did not impact the original operating earnings guidance. A list of revised schedules is available on page 34.

Important Notes to Investors  

This Revised 4Q19 Earnings Release Kit contains certain forward-looking statements, including our forecasted operating earnings for the first-quarter and full-year 2020 which are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to: unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; extreme weather events and other natural disasters; federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments; changes to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including proposed carbon regulations; cost of environmental compliance; changes in enforcement practices of regulators relating to environmental standards and litigation exposure for remedial activities; capital market conditions, including the availability of credit and the ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in rating agency requirements or credit ratings and their effect on availability and cost of capital; impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, transfers of assets by Dominion Energy to joint ventures and retirements of assets based on asset portfolio reviews; receipt of approvals for, and timing of, closing dates for other acquisitions and divestitures; changes in demand for Dominion Energys services; additional competition in Dominion Energys industries; changes to regulated rates collected by Dominion Energy; changes in operating, maintenance and construction costs; timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction or expansion projects and compliance with conditions associated with such regulatory approvals; adverse outcomes in litigation matters or regulatory proceedings; and the inability to complete planned construction projects within time frames initially anticipated. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominion Energys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

Certain information provided in this Revised 4Q19 Earnings Release Kit includes financial measures that are not required by, or presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), including operating earnings before interest and taxes (Adjusted EBIT). These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to GAAP measures, such as net income, operating income, or earnings per share, and may be calculated differently from, and therefore may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures used at other companies. Dominion Energy has included reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures it is able to calculate and report in accordance with GAAP.  

The consolidated financial data and statistics in this Revised 4Q19 Earnings Release Kit and its individual components reflect the financial position and operating results of Dominion Energy and its primary operating segments through December 31, 2019. Independent auditors have not audited any of the financial and operating statements. Projections or forecasts shown in this document are subject to change at any time. Dominion Energy undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking information statement to reflect developments after the statement is made.  

This Revised 4Q19 Earnings Release Kit has been prepared primarily for securities analysts and investors in the hope that it will serve as a convenient and useful reference document. The format of this release kit may change in the future as we continue to try to meet the needs of securities analysts and investors. This Revised 4Q19 Earnings Release Kit is not intended for use in connection with any sale, offer to sell, or solicitation of any offer to buy securities.

Earnings Release and Accompanying Schedules  

Earnings Report  

SUMMARY OF DOMINIONS 2019 EARNINGS AS REVISED ON FEBRUARY 28, 2020  

       

Fourth-quarter 2019 GAAP (reported) earnings of $1.21 per share; operating earnings of $1.18 per share  

       

Full-year 2019 reported earnings of $1.62 per share; operating earnings of $4.24 per share  

       

Company initiates 2020 operating earnings guidance of $4.25 to $4.60 per share  

Dominion Energys reported earnings determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (reported earnings) for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019, of $1.0 billion ($1.21 per share) compared with net income of $641 million ($0.97 per share) for the same period in 2018. Reported earnings for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2019, were $1.4 billion ($1.62 per share) compared with earnings of $2.4 billion ($3.74 per share) for the same period in 2018.  

Operating earnings for the three months ended Dec. 31, 2019, were $988 million ($1.18 per share), compared with operating earnings of $592 million ($0.89 per share) for the same period in 2018. Operating earnings for the twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2019, were $3.4 billion ($4.24 per share) compared with operating earnings of $2.7 billion ($4.05 per share) for the same period in 2018.  

Operating earnings are defined as reported earnings adjusted for certain items. Details of operating earnings as compared to prior periods, business segment results and detailed descriptions of items included in reported earnings but excluded from operating earnings can be found on Schedules 1, 2, 3 and 4 of this release.  

Operating earnings guidance  

Dominion Energy expects 2020 operating earnings in the range of $4.25 to $4.60 per share, compared to full-year 2019 operating earnings of $4.24 per share. Positive drivers include regulated investment growth across electric and gas businesses, lower financing costs due to lower average debt balances, the full-year impact of the Millstone nuclear facility zero-carbon procurement contract, and lower depreciation expense associated with an anticipated extension of the useful life assumption for our regulated nuclear plants in Virginia. The company expects negative drivers for the year to include increased minority interest expense associated with the equity recapitalization of Cove Point, share dilution, two planned refueling outages at Millstone and lower New England capacity prices.  

First-quarter 2020 operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.25 per share.  

Important note to investors regarding operating, reported earnings  

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the Board of Directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.

In providing its operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact of these items on future period reported earnings.

2020 Earnings Expectations  

Earnings Per Share (diluted)  

Reconciliation of measures prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) versus non-GAAP measures  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 1.  

In providing its first-quarter and full-year 2020 operating earnings guidance, the company notes that there could be differences between expected reported earnings and estimated operating earnings for matters such as, but not limited to, acquisitions, divestitures or changes in accounting principles. At this time, Dominion Energy management is not able to estimate the aggregate impact, if any, of these items on future period reported earnings. Accordingly, Dominion Energy is not able to provide a corresponding GAAP equivalent for its operating earnings guidance.  

Dominion Energy uses operating earnings as the primary performance measurement of its earnings guidance and results for public communications with analysts and investors. Dominion Energy also uses operating earnings internally for budgeting, for reporting to the board of directors, for the companys incentive compensation plans and for its targeted dividend payouts and other purposes. Dominion Energy management believes operating earnings provide a more meaningful representation of the companys fundamental earnings power.  

Dominion Energys estimates of first-quarter and full-year 2020 earnings are subject to various risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to: unusual weather conditions and their effect on energy sales to customers and energy commodity prices; extreme weather events and other natural disasters; federal, state and local legislative and regulatory developments; changes to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including proposed carbon regulations; cost of environmental compliance; changes in enforcement practices of regulators relating to environmental standards and litigation exposure for remedial activities; capital market conditions, including the availability of credit and the ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms; fluctuations in interest rates; changes in rating agency requirements or credit ratings and their effect on availability and cost of capital; impacts of acquisitions, divestitures, transfers of assets by Dominion Energy to joint ventures and retirements of assets based on asset portfolio reviews; receipt of approvals for, and timing of, closing dates for other acquisitions and divestitures; changes in demand for Dominion Energys services; additional competition in Dominion Energys industries; changes to regulated rates collected by Dominion Energy; changes in operating, maintenance and construction costs; timing and receipt of regulatory approvals necessary for planned construction or expansion projects and compliance with conditions associated with such regulatory approvals; adverse outcomes in litigation matters or regulatory proceedings; and the inability to complete planned construction projects within time frames initially anticipated. Other risk factors are detailed from time to time in Dominion Energys quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
