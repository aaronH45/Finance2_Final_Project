Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of Welltower Inc. presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) for the periods presented and should be read together with the notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other important factors are identified in “Item 1 — Business” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above.

Executive Summary

Company Overview

Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower™, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate assets.

The following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Represents consolidated net operating income ("NOI") and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliation.

Business Strategy

Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.

Substantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees/services and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.

In addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.

For the year ended December 31, 2019, resident fees/services and rental income represented 67% and 31%, respectively, of total revenues. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.

We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from NOI and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.

Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. At December 31, 2019, we had $284,917,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $100,849,000 of restricted cash and $1,411,400,000 of available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.

Key Transactions

Capital The following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred and supported new investments made during the year ended December 31, 2019: 

•In January 2019, we established an unsecured commercial paper program. Under the terms of the program, we may issue, from time to time, unsecured commercial paper with maturities that vary, but do not exceed 397 days from the date of issue, up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $1,000,000,000. 

•In February 2019, we elected to effect the mandatory conversion of all of the outstanding 6.50% Series I Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock. Each share of convertible stock was converted into 0.8857 shares of common stock.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Key Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties

We utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.

Operating Performance We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”) per the Statement of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and consolidated net operating income (“NOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Credit Strength  We measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) section 1031 deposits. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest, secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends). We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented: 

43

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Concentration Risk  We evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our various property types. Relationship mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five relationships. Geographic mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five states (or international equivalents). The following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by NOI for the years indicated below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities and non-segment/corporate NOI. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.

(2) Revera owns a controlling interest in Sunrise Senior Living.

We evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in “Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to “Item 1 — Business,” “Item 1A — Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.

Corporate Governance

Maintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today’s business environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Sources and Uses of Cash

Our primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses and general and administrative expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities  The change in net cash provided from operating activities is attributable to changes in NOI, which is primarily due to acquisitions and annual rent increasers, partially offset by dispositions. Please see “Results of Operations” below for further discussion. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.

Investing Activities The changes in net cash used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments, loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 3, 7, and 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization. 

Financing Activities  The changes in net cash provided from financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuance/redemptions of common and preferred stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 10, 11 and 14 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2019, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 50%. We use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. At December 31, 2019, we had thirteen outstanding letter of credit obligations. Please see Notes 8, 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(5) See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

(6) See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.

Capital Structure

Please refer to “Credit Strength” above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.

On May 17, 2018, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (1) an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf registration statement covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock. As of January 31, 2020, 2,728,696 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration statement. On February 25, 2019, we entered into separate amended and restated equity distribution agreements with each of Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, MUFG Securities Americas Inc., RBC Capital Markets, LLC, UBS Securities LLC and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC relating to the offer and sale from time to time of up to $1,500,000,000 aggregate amount of our common stock (“Equity Shelf Program”), which replaced our existing equity shelf program entered into on August 3, 2018. The Equity Shelf Program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements. As of January 31, 2020, we had $1,075,537,000 of remaining capacity under the Equity Shelf Program, which excludes

forward sales agreements outstanding for the sale of 6,799,978 shares with maturity dates in 2020 and 2021. We expect to physically settle the forward sales for cash proceeds. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.

Results of Operations

Summary

Our primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services, rent and interest income. Our primary expenses include interest expense, depreciation and amortization, property operating expenses, other expenses and general and administrative expenses. We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and SSNOI and other supplemental measures include FFO and Adjusted EBITDA, which are further discussed below. Please see "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information and reconciliations related to these supplemental measures. 

This section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

The following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2019 (in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

During the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs. Presuming the current inflation rate remains moderate and long-term interest rates do not increase significantly, we believe that inflation will not impact the availability of equity and debt financing for us.

Seniors Housing Operating 

 The following is a summary of our same store NOI ("SSNOI") for the Seniors Housing Operating segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) Relates to 341 properties for the 2018 and 2019 Same Store Pool and 390 properties for the 2017 and 2018 Same Store Pool.

The following is a summary of our results of operations for the Seniors Housing Operating segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] (1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

Fluctuations in resident fees and services and property operating expenses are primarily a result of acquisitions, segment transitions and the movement of U.S. and foreign currency exchange rates. The fluctuations in depreciation and amortization are due to acquisitions and variations in amortization of short-lived intangible assets. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly.

During the three years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale and held for use properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair values. The fluctuations in gains (losses) on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. The significant gain on real estate dispositions recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 is related to the sale of the Benchmark Senior Living portfolio. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of the purchase price. The increase in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily due to additional noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and operator transitions.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed two Seniors Housing Operating construction projects representing $28,117,000 or $109,405 per unit. The following is a summary of our Seniors Housing Operating construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Interest expense represents secured debt interest expense which fluctuates based on the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The following is a summary of our Seniors Housing Operating property secured debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The majority of our Seniors Housing Operating properties are formed through partnership interests. The increase in income (loss) from unconsolidated entities are largely due to a gain on the disposition of an unconsolidated entity during the year ended December 31, 2019. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2019 relates primarily to our partner's share of the gain recognized on the sale of the Benchmark Senior Living portfolio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

(2) See Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.

The increase to rental income for the year ended December 31, 2019 is primarily attributable to acquisitions including Quality Care Properties ("QCP") in July 2018. In addition, we have recorded certain real estate property taxes on a gross basis, with the offset to property operating expenses, as a result of our ASC 842 adoption on January 1, 2019. These increases are partially offset by the disposition or segment transition of various properties. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the CPI do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, we had 20 leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 0.12% to 0.76% in our Triple-net portfolio. The increase in other income for the year ended December 31, 2018 is primarily due to $10,805,000 of net lease termination fees recognized.

Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily as a result of the disposition of triple-net properties exceeding acquisition and segment transitions. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a provision for loan loss of $18,690,000 to fully reserve for and eventually wrote off certain real estate loans receivable that are no longer deemed collectible.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

During the years presented, we recorded impairment charges on certain held for sale and held for use properties as the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair values. The fluctuations in gains on real estate dispositions are due to the volume of property sales and sales prices. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. The fluctuations in other expenses is primarily due noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions, segment transitions and the termination/restructuring of preexisting relationships. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $79,576,000 related to a joint venture transaction, including the conversion of properties from Triple-net to Seniors Housing Operating and termination/restructuring of preexisting relationships.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no construction projects completed. The following is a summary of Triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The fluctuation in loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market adjustment recorded on our Genesis HealthCare available-for-sale investment. The following is a summary of our Triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

A portion of our triple-net properties were formed through partnerships. Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

51

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1) See Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.

The fluctuations in rental income are primarily attributable to the acquisitions of new properties and the conversion of newly constructed outpatient medical properties, particularly the $1.25 billion CNL Healthcare Properties portfolio acquisition that closed in May 2019, partially offset by dispositions. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the CPI. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the CPI does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rent rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the three months ended December 31, 2019, our consolidated outpatient medical portfolio signed 193,173 square feet of new leases and 424,579 square feet of renewals. The weighted-average term of these leases was six years, with a rate of $31.95 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $23.59 per square foot. Substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 2.0% to 3.5%.

The fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to acquisitions and construction conversions of new outpatient medical facilities, offset by dispositions. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. We recognized impairment charges related to certain held for sale properties as the carrying values exceeded the estimated fair values less costs to sell. Changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices. 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed one Outpatient Medical construction project representing $21,006,000 or $286 per square foot. The following is a summary of Outpatient Medical construction projects pending as of December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands):

Total interest expense represents secured debt interest expense. The change in secured debt interest expense is primarily due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt. The following is a summary of our Outpatient Medical secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):

A portion of our Outpatient Medical properties were formed through partnerships. Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income or loss relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.

The change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, as well as the movement in foreign exchange rates and related hedge activity. Please refer to Note 11 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. The change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. The loss on extinguishment recognized in 2019 is due primarily to the early extinguishment of the $600,000,000 of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and the $450,000,000 of 6.125% senior unsecured notes due 2020 in March 2019, the early extinguishment of the $450,000,000 of 4.95% senior unsecured notes due 2021 and the $600,000,000 of 5.25% senior unsecured notes due 2022 in September 2019 and the early redemption of the $300 million Canadian-denominated 3.35% senior unsecured notes due 2020 in December 2019. The loss on extinguishment of debt in 2018 is due to the term loan facility drawn on in July 2018 and paid off in August 2018.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 2.47%, 2.69% and 2.83%, respectively. 

Other expenses for all years include severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees. 

The decrease in preferred dividends is due to the conversion of all outstanding Series I Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preferred Stock during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”), as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.

Consolidated net operating income (“NOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (“SSNOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the eight quarters ended December 31, 2019 ("2018 and 2019 Same Store Pool") and December 31, 2018 ("2017 and 2018 Same Store Pool"). Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties acquired, under development, transitioned to a different segment, sold or classified as held for sale during that period are excluded from the same store amounts. Additionally, unconsolidated properties are excluded from the same store amounts. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.

EBITDA stands for earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We believe that EBITDA, along with net income and cash flow provided from operating activities, is an important supplemental measure because it provides additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily utilize EBITDA to measure our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest, secured debt principal amortization, and preferred dividends. Covenants in our senior unsecured notes and primary unsecured credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA that is specific to those agreements. Failure to satisfy these covenants could result in an event of default that could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Due to the materiality of these debt agreements and the financial covenants, we have disclosed Adjusted EBITDA, which represents EBITDA as defined above excluding unconsolidated entities and adjusted for items per our covenant. We use Adjusted EBITDA to measure our adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges on a trailing twelve months basis. Fixed charges include total interest (excluding capitalized interest and non-cash interest expenses), secured debt principal amortization and preferred dividends. Our covenant requires an adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.50 times.

Our supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.

Our leverage ratios include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt less cash and cash equivalents and any IRC section 1031 deposits), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization. The table below reflects the reconciliation of our leverage ratios to our balance sheets for the periods presented. Amounts are in thousands, except share price.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Management considers accounting estimates or assumptions critical if:

•the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and

•the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material.

Management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to them. Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. However, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.

The following table presents information about our critical accounting policies, as well as the material assumptions used to develop each estimate:
