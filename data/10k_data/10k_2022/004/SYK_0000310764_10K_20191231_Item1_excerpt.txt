The Company offers innovative products and services in Orthopaedics, Medical and Surgical, and Neurotechnology and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes.

Our core values guide our behaviors and actions and are fundamental to how we execute our mission. 

Stryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several medical products. Our products are sold in over 75 countries through company-owned subsidiaries and branches, as well as third-party dealers and distributors, and include implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical, neurovascular and spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties. In the United States most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.

As used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, "Stryker," "we," "us," and "our" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.

Orthopaedics

Orthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremities surgeries. We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and 

specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective. We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques. The Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted Surgical System was designed to help surgeons provide patients with a personalized surgical experience based on their specific diagnosis and anatomy. The Mako System currently offers three applications supporting Partial Knee, Total Hip and Total Knee procedures. Mako is the only robotic-arm assisted technology enabled by 3D CT-based pre-operative planning, and with AccuStop™ haptic technology, Mako provides surgeons intra-operative haptic guidance for bone preparation and implant placement.

Stryker is one of four leading global competitors for joint replacement and trauma and extremities products; the other three being Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), DePuy Synthes (a Johnson & Johnson company) and Smith & Nephew plc (Smith & Nephew).

In 2019 Stryker received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) pre-market approval (PMA) of its Neuroform Atlas™ Stent System for the treatment of wide-neck intracranial aneurysms in conjunction with embolic detachable coils in the anterior circulation of the neurovasculature. The Neuroform Atlas™ device was previously approved under a humanitarian device exemption, which restricted use to specific hospitals with institutional review board approval. PMA was granted based on robust clinical trial evidence proving the efficacy of the device.

In 2018 Stryker received FDA PMA for the Surpass Streamline™ Flow Diverter to treat unruptured large and giant wide neck intracranial aneurysms. The device was the second flow diverting stent to gain FDA approval in the United States, expanding our commercial footprint into the flow diversion market and reinforcing our commitment to complete stroke care for patients suffering from cerebrovascular disease. Stryker’s next generation flow diverting stent, Surpass Evolve™, received CE mark approval in 2019.

Raw Materials and Inventory

Raw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources; however, certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers. Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order. 

Patents and Trademarks

Patents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December 31, 2019 we owned approximately 3,392 United States patents and approximately 5,491 international patents.

Seasonality

Our business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally higher in the fourth quarter.

Competition

In each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business. Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces.

We believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products. 

Regulation

Our businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.

In the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications. Certain of our products also fall under the FDA's drug classification, as well as other FDA classifications.

The FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.

The member states of the European Union (EU) adopted the European Medical Device Directives, which form a single set of medical device regulations for all EU member countries. These regulations require companies that manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member countries to meet certain quality system requirements and obtain CE marking for their products. We have authorization to apply the CE marking to substantially all of our products. In addition, the EU enacted the EU Medical Device Regulation (EU MDR) in May 2017 with an effective date of May 2020, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post-market surveillance. Finally, we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each of the countries in Europe and other countries, including China, in which we market our products.

Initiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies. The resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.

Environment

We are subject to various rules and regulation in the United States and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net earnings or competitive position. 

Employees

On December 31, 2019 we had approximately 40,000 employees globally.
