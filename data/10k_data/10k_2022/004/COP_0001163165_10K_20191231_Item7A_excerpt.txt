 QUANTITATIVE

 AND QUALITATIVE

 DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Financial Instrument Market Risk 

We and certain of our subsidiaries hold and issue derivative contracts and financial

 instruments that expose our 

cash flows or earnings to changes in commodity

 prices, foreign currency exchange rates

 or interest rates.

 We 

may use financial and commodity-based derivative

 contracts to manage the risks produced by changes

 in the 

prices of natural gas, crude oil and related products;

 fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency 

exchange rates; or to capture market opportunities. 

Our use of derivative instruments is governed

 by an “Authority Limitations” document

 approved by our Board 

of Directors that prohibits the use of highly leveraged

 derivatives or derivative instruments without

 sufficient 

liquidity.

 The Authority Limitations document also establishes

 the Value at Risk (VaR)

 limits for the 

company, and compliance with these limits is monitored daily.

 The Executive Vice President and Chief 

Financial Officer, who reports to the Chief Executive Officer, monitors commodity price risk

 and risks 

resulting from foreign currency exchange rates and

 interest rates.

 The Commercial organization manages our 

commercial marketing, optimizes our commodity

 flows and positions, and monitors risks.

Commodity Price Risk 

Our Commercial organization uses futures, forwards, swaps

 and options in various markets to accomplish

 the 

following objectives: 

●

Meet customer needs.

 Consistent with our policy to generally

 remain exposed to market prices, we 

use swap contracts to convert fixed-price sales

 contracts, which are often requested by natural

 gas 

consumers, to floating market prices. 

●

Enable us to use market knowledge to capture opportunities

 such as moving physical commodities to 

more profitable locations and storing commodities

 to capture seasonal or time premiums.

 We may use 

derivatives to optimize these activities.

We use a VaR

 model to estimate the loss in fair value that

 could potentially result on a single day from the 

effect of adverse changes in market conditions on the derivative

 financial instruments and derivative 

commodity instruments we hold or issue, including

 commodity purchases and sales contracts

 recorded on the 

balance sheet at December 31, 2019,

 as derivative instruments.

 Using Monte Carlo simulation, a 95 percent 

confidence level and a one-day holding period, the

 VaR

 for those instruments issued or held for

 trading 

purposes or held for purposes other than trading

 at December 31, 2019 and 2018,

 was immaterial to our 

consolidated cash flows and net income attributable

 to ConocoPhillips.

Interest Rate Risk 

The following table provides information

 about our debt instruments that are sensitive to

 changes in U.S. 

interest rates.

 The table presents

 principal cash flows and related weighted-average

 interest rates by expected 

maturity dates.

 Weighted-average variable rates are based on effective rates at the reporting date.

 The 

carrying amount of our floating-rate debt approximates

 its fair value.

 The fair value of the fixed-rate debt is 

measured using prices available from a pricing

 service that is corroborated by market

 data.

Foreign Currency Exchange Risk

We have foreign currency exchange rate risk resulting from international operations.

 We do not 

comprehensively hedge the exposure to currency

 exchange rate changes although we

 may choose to selectively 

hedge certain foreign currency exchange rate exposures,

 such as firm commitments for capital projects

 or local 

currency tax payments, dividends and cash returns from

 net investments in foreign affiliates to be remitted 

within the coming year, and investments in equity securities. 

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we held foreign

 currency exchange forwards hedging cross-border 

commercial activity and foreign currency exchange

 swaps and options for purposes of mitigating

 our cash-

related exposures.

 Although these forwards, swaps and options

 hedge exposures to fluctuations in exchange 

rates, we elected not to utilize hedge accounting.

 As a result, the change in the fair value of these foreign 

currency exchange derivatives is recorded directly

 in earnings.

At December 31, 2019,

 we had outstanding foreign currency exchange

 forward contracts to sell $1.35 billion 

CAD at $0.748 CAD against the U.S. dollar.

 At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding foreign

 currency 

zero-cost collars buying the right to sell $1.25 billion

 CAD at $0.707

 CAD and selling the right to buy $1.25 

billion CAD at $0.842 CAD against the U.S. dollar.

 Based on the assumed volatility in the fair value 

calculation, the net fair value of these foreign currency

 contracts at December 31, 2019 and

 December 31, 

2018, was a before-tax loss of $28 million and a before-tax

 gain of $6

 million, respectively.

 Based on an 

adverse hypothetical 10 percent change in the

 December 2019 and December 2018 exchange rate, this

 would 

result in an additional before-tax loss of $115 million and $17 million,

 respectively.

 The sensitivity analysis is 

based on changing one assumption while holding

 all other assumptions constant, which in practice

 may be 

unlikely to occur, as changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated.
