Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

At February 1, 2020, our variable rate debt consists of our $250.0 million Senior Floating Rate Notes due April 2020. A hypothetical increase of one percentage point on these notes would not materially affect our results of operations or cash flows.
