Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This section of the Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 detail and year-over-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. For a comparison of our results for 2018 to our results of 2017 and other financial information related to 2017, refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended February 2, 2019 filed with the SEC on April 2, 2019. 

Business Overview

Foot Locker, Inc. leads the celebration of sneaker and youth culture around the globe through a portfolio of brands including Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, Eastbay, Footaction, Runners Point, and Sidestep. As of February 1, 2020, we operated 3,129 primarily mall-based stores, as well as stores in high-traffic urban retail areas and high streets, in 27 countries across the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. Our purpose is to inspire and empower youth culture around the world, by fueling a shared passion for self-expression and creating unrivaled experiences at the heart of the global sneaker community.

Foot Locker, Inc. uses its omni-channel capabilities to bridge the digital world and physical stores, including order-in-store, buy online and pickup-in-store, and buy online and ship-from-store, as well as e-commerce. We operate websites and mobile apps aligned with the brand names of our store banners (including footlocker.com, ladyfootlocker.com, kidsfootlocker.com, champssports.com, footaction.com, footlocker.ca, footlocker.eu (and related e-commerce sites in the various European countries that we operate) footlocker.com.au, runnerspoint.com, sidestep-shoes.com, footlocker.hk, footlocker.sg, and footlocker.my). These sites offer some of the largest online product selections and provide a seamless link between e-commerce and physical stores. We also operate the websites for eastbay.com, final-score.com, and eastbayteamsales.com.

Segment Reporting

Our operating segments are identified according to how our business activities are managed and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker, our CEO. During 2018, we expanded into Asia and launched our digital channels across Singapore, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. During the first quarter of 2019, we changed our organizational and internal reporting structure to support an accelerated growth strategy for the region. We opened an Asian headquarters in Singapore and realigned our organization into three distinct geographic regions: North America, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific. 

​

Accordingly, in the first quarter of 2019, we re-evaluated our operating segments. We determined that we have three operating segments, North America, EMEA, and Asia Pacific. Our North America operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in the U.S. and Canada: Foot Locker, Kids Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Champs Sports, and Footaction, including each of their related e-commerce businesses, as well as our Eastbay business that includes internet, catalog, and team sales. Our EMEA operating segment includes the results of the following banners operating in Europe: Foot Locker, Runners Point, Sidestep, and Kids Foot Locker, including each of their related e-commerce businesses. Our Asia Pacific operating segment includes the results of Foot Locker and Kids Foot Locker operating in Australia, New Zealand, and Asia as well as the related e-commerce businesses operating in Australia and Asia. We have further aggregated these operating segments into one reportable segment based upon their shared customer base and similar economic characteristics.

Recent Events and Trends

COVID-19 is having a significant effect on overall economic conditions in the various geographic areas in which we have operations. Our top priority is to protect our associates and their families, our customers, and our operations. We are taking all precautionary measures as directed by health authorities and local and national governments. On March 18, 2020, in response to intensifying efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19, we temporarily closed our stores across all of our brands in North America, EMEA, and Malaysia. On March 25, 2020, we temporarily closed our stores in New Zealand. The rest of our locations in the Asia Pacific region, which include Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia, will remain open subject to direction from local and national governments. We continue to monitor the outbreak of COVID-19 and other closures, or closures for a longer period of time, may be required to help ensure the health and safety of our associates and our customers. COVID-19 has and may continue to have an effect on ports and trade, as well as global travel. We have set up a special management committee and the committee is taking the necessary precautionary measures to protect the health and safety of our associates as well as following the guidance provided by local health authorities. Given the dynamic nature of these circumstances, the duration of business disruption, and reduced customer traffic, the related financial affect cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but are expected to materially affect our business for the first quarter and full year of 2020.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

In addition to reporting our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), we report certain financial results that differ from what is reported under GAAP. In the following tables, we have presented certain financial measures and ratios identified as non-GAAP such as sales excluding 53rd week, Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (“EBIT”), adjusted EBIT, adjusted EBIT margin, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted net income, adjusted net income margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, Return on Invested Capital (“ROIC”), free cash flow, and net debt capitalization. We present these non-GAAP measures because we believe they assist investors in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that are not indicative of our core business or which affect comparability. In addition, these non-GAAP measures are useful in assessing our progress in achieving our long-term financial objectives.

Additionally, we present certain amounts as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, which are also considered non-GAAP measures. Throughout the following discussions, where amounts are expressed as excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, such changes are determined by translating all amounts in both years using the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. Presenting amounts on a constant currency basis is useful to investors because it enables them to better understand the changes in our businesses that are not related to currency movements.

Fiscal year 2017 represented the fifty-three weeks ended February 3, 2018. Accordingly, certain non-GAAP results have also been adjusted to exclude the effects of the 53rd week to assist in comparability.

We estimate the tax effect of the non-GAAP adjustments by applying a marginal rate to each of the respective items. The income tax items represent the discrete amount that affected the period. 

The non-GAAP financial information is provided in addition to, and not as an alternative to, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Presented below is a reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP results discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please see the non-GAAP reconciliations for free cash flow and net debt capitalization in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section.

Notes on Non-GAAP Adjustments:

​

(1)Impairment and other charges for 2019 includes impairment charges related to certain of our Footaction stores, certain underperforming stores, a vacant store that was previously subleased, the closure of our SIX:02 stores ($50 million, or $38 million after-tax), the impairment related to two of our minority investments ($11 million, or $8 million after-tax), and pension-related charges ($4 million, or $3 million after-tax). The 2018 amount represented pension-related litigation charges ($18 million, or $13 million after-tax) and impairment charges associated with our SIX:02, Runners Point, and Sidestep businesses ($19 million, or $18 million after-tax). The 2017 amount represented pension-related litigation charges ($178 million, or $111 million after-tax), impairment charges associated with our SIX:02, Runners Point, and Sidestep businesses ($20 million, or $14 million after-tax), and costs associated with the reorganization and the reduction of division and corporate staff ($13 million, or $8 million after-tax). 

(2)Other income, net represented a gain recorded in connection with acquisition of a Canadian distribution center lease and related assets. The tax expense related to this transaction was largely offset by the release of a valuation allowance.

(3)On December 22, 2017, the United States enacted tax reform legislation that included a broad range of business tax provisions. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a $99 million provisional charge for the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign sourced net earnings and a corresponding change in our permanent reinvestment assertion under ASC 740-30. During 2018, we reduced the provisional amounts by $28 million. This adjustment represented a $21 million reduction in the deemed repatriation tax and a $7 million benefit related to IRS accounting method changes and timing difference adjustments. In 2019, we recorded a charge for $2 million, which reflected an adjustment to U.S. tax on foreign income. We exclude the discrete U.S. tax reform effect from our Adjusted diluted EPS as it does not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under U.S. tax reform.

(4)We recognized a tax benefit of $2 million and a tax expense of $4 million during the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, respectively, in connection with tax law changes in the Netherlands. During 2017 we recorded a charge of $2 million in connection with tax rate reductions in France to write down the value of deferred tax assets.

(5)During the second quarter of 2018, the U.S. Treasury issued a notice that delayed the effective date of regulations under Internal Revenue Code Section 987 The effective date was further delayed by a notice issued in the fourth quarter of 2019. These regulations changed our method for determining the tax effects of foreign currency translation gains and losses for our foreign businesses that are operated as branches and are reported in a currency other than the currency of their parent. As a result of the delay in the effective date, we updated our calculations for the effect of these regulations, which resulted in an increase to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our income tax provision in the amount of $1 million in 2018. The 2019 tax effects were not significant.

(6)Valuation allowances were established against deferred tax assets associated with certain foreign tax losses.

Return on Invested Capital 

ROIC is presented below and represents a non-GAAP measure. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC, subject to certain adjustments, is also used as a measure in executive long-term incentive compensation.

The closest U.S. GAAP measure to ROIC is Return on Assets (“ROA”) and is also presented below. ROA is calculated as net income in the fiscal year divided by the two-year average of total assets. ROA decreased to 9.4 percent as compared with 13.9 percent in the prior year. This decrease primarily reflected the adoption of the new lease standard, which resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets in the current year. Excluding the effect of the addition of right-of-use assets, ROA would have declined by 80 basis points.

Prior to the adoption of the new lease standard, we adjusted our results to reflect our operating leases as if they qualified for capital lease treatment or as if the property were purchased. This prior year presentation does not reflect the requirements of the new lease standard. With the adoption of this standard, leases are now recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and therefore, certain adjustments are no longer required. Our ROIC increased to 12.5 percent in 2019, as compared to 12.0 percent as calculated in the prior year. The overall increase in ROIC reflected a decrease in average invested capital compared with the prior year and a higher adjusted return after taxes. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

(1)Represents net income of $491 million, $541 million, and $284 million divided by average total assets of $5,205 million, $3,891 million, and $3,901 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Calculation of ROIC:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

​

(1)For 2018 and 2017, the determination of the capitalized operating leases and the adjustments to income were calculated on a lease-by-lease basis and represented the best estimate of the asset base that would be recorded for operating leases as if they had been classified as capital or as if the property were purchased. No such adjustments are required for 2019 since leases are accounted for on the Consolidated Balance Sheet after the adoption of the new leasing standard. 

(2)Represents the add-back to operating income driven by the hypothetical interest expense we would incur if the property under our operating leases were owned or accounted for as finance leases. Calculated using the discount rate for each lease and recorded as a component of rent expense. Operating lease interest is added back to adjusted net operating profit in the ROIC calculation to control for differences in capital structure between us and our competitors.

(3)The adjusted income tax expense represents the marginal tax rate applied to adjusted net operating profit for each of the periods presented.

(4)For 2019, the amount represents the average total assets for 2019 and 2018, excluding the 2019 right-of-use assets of $2,899 million for comparability to prior periods. 

(5)For 2019, the amount represents the average of the right-of-use assets as of February 1, 2020 and February 3, 2019 (the date of the adoption of the new lease standard) of $2,899 million and $3,148 million, respectively.

Overview of Consolidated Results

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Highlights of our 2019 financial performance include:

●Sales and comparable-store sales, as noted in the table below, both increased and benefitted from improved assortments compared with the prior year and the continued alignment of our e-commerce and stores businesses. Our customers are able to shop and buy seamlessly between our channels. We worked closely with our strategic vendor partners to deliver exciting and exclusive product offerings and improved our local product assortments. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

●Footwear sales represented 83 percent of total sales for all periods presented. 

●Our stores and direct-to-customer sales channels experienced overall comparable-sales gains of 1.6 percent and 5.6 percent, respectively. Our direct-to-customers sales channel increased to 16.1 percent of total sales or an increase of 70 basis points as compared with last year.

●Sales per square foot increased by 1.2 percent to $510 reflecting the productivity of the fleet that resulted from rationalization, such as store closures and changes in store layouts.

●Sales of our direct-to-customers channel increased by 4.9 percent to $1,285 million, as compared with $1,225 million in 2018. The direct business has been steadily increasing as a percentage of total sales over the last several years. This growth reflects the continued positive customer satisfaction with our various e-commerce enhancements, such as the acceptance of new payment types and improved product availability.

●Gross margin, as a percentage of sales, remained consistent with 2018 at 31.8 percent. This was driven by a decrease in our merchandise margin rate, offset by a lower occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate as compared with the prior year. 

●SG&A expenses were 20.6 percent of sales, an increase of 30 basis points as compared with the prior year. The overall increase reflected an increase in costs incurred in connection with our ongoing investment in various technology and infrastructure projects, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. 

●Net income was $491 million, or $4.50 diluted earnings per share, which represented a decrease from the prior-year period. This decrease reflected higher SG&A and impairment charges as compared to the prior year. Adjusted net income was $538 million, or $4.93 diluted earnings per share, an increase of 4.7 percent from the corresponding prior-year period non-GAAP amount.

●Net income margin decreased to 6.1 percent as compared with 6.8 percent in the prior year. Our adjusted net income margin decreased to 6.7 percent in 2019 as compared to 6.9 percent in the prior year.

​

2019 Form 10-K Page 22

​ 

​

Highlights of our financial position for the period ended February 1, 2020 include:

●We ended the year in a strong financial position. At year end, we had $785 million of cash and cash equivalents, net of debt. Cash and cash equivalents at February 1, 2020 were $907 million.

●Net cash provided by operating activities was $696 million as compared with $781 million last year. While this a decline, it still represents a demonstrated ability to generate significant cash.

●Cash capital expenditures during 2019 totaled $187 million and were primarily directed to the remodeling or relocation of 148 stores, the build-out of 67 new stores, as well as other technology and infrastructure projects.

●We made minority investments of $50 million during 2019. These investments are part of our broader strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening and diversifying our role within the sneaker community. Additionally, we expect that these strategic investments allow us to better adapt to the dynamically evolving consumer and retail landscape by strengthening our capabilities, providing diversification, and gaining greater insights into youth culture. Due to the early stage of these investments, it is expected that some will not be successful. In the fourth quarter, we recorded charges totaling $11 million to reflect insolvency for one of our investments and reduced valuation for another investment, both investments were made during 2018.

●During 2019, we returned significant amounts of cash to our shareholders. Dividends totaling $164 million were declared and paid during 2019, and 8.4 million shares were repurchased under our share repurchase program at a cost of $335 million. In February 2020, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of 5 percent. These initiatives demonstrate our commitment to delivering meaningful returns to our shareholders.

​

Sales

All references to comparable-store sales for a given period relate to sales of stores that were open at the period-end and had been open for more than one year. The computation of consolidated comparable-store sales also includes direct-to-customers sales. Stores opened or closed during the period are not included in the comparable-store base; however, stores closed temporarily for relocation or remodeling are included. Computations exclude the effect of foreign currency fluctuations. Comparable-store sales for 2017 does not include the sales from the 53rd week.

The information shown below represents certain sales metrics by sales channel: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following discussion describes the changes in sales by banner on an omni-channel basis, meaning that each banner’s results are inclusive of its store and e-commerce activity, unless noted otherwise.

In 2019, sales increased by 0.8 percent to $8,005 million from sales of $7,939 million in 2018. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, sales decreased by 2.0 percent as compared with 2018. 

Comparable-store sales increased by 2.2 percent during 2019, as compared with the corresponding prior-year period. Both of our sales channels generated positive results as compared with the prior year. The overall comparable sales growth was led by our direct-to-customers channel, which increased by 5.6 percent as compared with the prior year. Each of our operating segments generated improved comparable sales, with North America and EMEA increasing by approximately 2 percent, while our smallest operating segment, Asia Pacific, generated comparable sales growth of low double digits.

2019 Form 10-K Page 23

​ 

​

In North America, Foot Locker Canada led the results, with a comparable-sales increase in the high-single digits, followed by Champs Sports and Foot Locker U.S. which generated mid-single digit and low-single digit increases, respectively. These increases were partially offset by declines in sales of our Eastbay and Footaction banners, as well as a modest decline in Kids Foot Locker. The decline in Eastbay’s sales was primarily due to softer demand for performance-related products. Footaction’s sales were negatively affected by the lack of product availability of certain key men’s footwear styles. Due to the continued underperformance of Footaction, management conducted an impairment evaluation, see additional discussion under the caption, Division Profit. North America’s sales were also negatively affected by the closure of the SIX:02 banner, as all stores were closed by the end of the third quarter. Kids Foot Locker’s sales were negatively affected by the decline of certain apparel styles. Our EMEA operating segment sales increased low single-digits primarily related to the growth in our e-commerce business for Foot Locker Europe and Sidestep. Asia Pacific generated a low double-digit increase, with e-commerce in Australia continuing to grow as customers enjoy our new payment methods and improved product offerings.

From a product perspective, footwear sales increased 4 percent on a comparable sales basis, with increases across all wearer segments and was led by sales of women’s and children’s footwear. During the year, we closed our SIX:02 banner to focus on our women’s business through our other banners and the increase in sales of women’s footwear demonstrates the success of our elevated women’s presentation in all our banners. The men’s footwear business experienced growth from sales of classic basketball styles and a modest increase in running styles. Apparel sales decreased across all wearer segments. Within men’s, our branded apparel sales, which represented the largest portion of our apparel sales, improved and was offset by declines in sales of private-label and licensed apparel. The declines represented a concerted effort to focus our assortment on more premium offerings.

Gross Margin[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross margin is calculated as sales minus cost of sales. Cost of sales includes: the cost of merchandise, freight, distribution costs including related depreciation expense, shipping and handling, occupancy and buyers’ compensation. Occupancy costs include rent (including fixed common area maintenance charges and other fixed non-lease components), real estate taxes, general maintenance, and utilities.

Overall, the gross margin rate remained consistent with the prior year at 31.8 percent. Within this, the merchandise margin rate declined reflecting, in part, higher freight costs due to a higher penetration of sales from our direct-to-customer channel as well as lower gross margin related to our apparel business due to a more promotional marketplace. The change in the gross margin rate also reflected an improvement in the occupancy and buyers’ compensation rate of 30 basis points due to increased sales and continued focus on rent reductions. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SG&A increased by $36 million or 2.2 percent in 2019, as compared with the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the SG&A rate increased by 30 basis points as compared with 2018. The overall increase represented an increase in costs incurred in connection with our ongoing investment in various technology and infrastructure projects, partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense of $18 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations, SG&A increased by $57 million and 3.5 percent as compared with the prior year. 

​

2019 Form 10-K Page 24

​ 

​

Depreciation and Amortization[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Depreciation and amortization increased by $1 million in 2019 as compared with 2018. The effect of foreign currency fluctuations on depreciation and amortization for the current year was not significant. 

Division Profit

​

Division profit was $738 million or 9.2 percent, as a percentage of sales. This compares with $789 million, or 9.9 percent, for last year. Division profit for 2019 included non-cash impairment charges of $37 million related to the write-down of store fixtures, leasehold, and right-of-use assets related to Footaction, certain other underperforming stores, and a vacant store that had been previously subleased. Also during the current year, we recorded $13 million of lease termination costs related to the closure our SIX:02 stores. In 2018, impairment charges were $19 million and related to SIX:02, Runners Point, and Sidestep. Excluding the effect of the impairment charges and lease termination costs from both years, our division profit decreased by 40 basis points. Both sales channels generated improved results, however gross margin declined in our direct-to-customers channel due to higher freight costs. Operating expenses grew at a faster rate than sales thereby reducing division profit. 

​

Other Charges

During 2019 we recorded charges totaling $15 million. During the fourth quarter we recorded non-cash charges of $11 million related to the write-down of two minority investments. Additionally, we incurred $4 million related to the pension matter. See Note 3, Impairment and Other Charges for additional information.

Corporate Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses as well as depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters, centrally managed departments, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, certain foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, and other items. Depreciation and amortization included in corporate expense was $19 million, $18 million, and $16 million in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The allocation of corporate expense to the operating divisions is adjusted annually based upon an internal study; accordingly, the allocation increased by $32 million in 2019, thus reducing corporate expense. Excluding the corporate allocation change, corporate expense increased by $34 million as compared with 2018. This increase was primarily due to technology spending related to our various technology initiatives. Additionally, we incurred additional professional fees partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense.

Interest Income, net[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The changes during 2019 primarily relate to the amounts earned as interest income. Interest income increased by $2 million in 2019 as compared with 2018. The increase represented increased income due to higher average interest rates on our cash investments. We did not have any short-term borrowings, other than small amounts related to capital leases, for any of the periods presented.

2019 Form 10-K Page 25

​ 

​

Other Income, net[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Other income, net includes non-operating items, including franchise royalty income, changes in fair value, premiums paid, realized gains and losses associated with foreign currency option contracts, changes in the market value of our available-for-sale security, our share of earnings or losses related to our equity method investment, and net benefit expense related to our pension and postretirement programs excluding the service cost component. 

Other income, net for the year ended February 1, 2020 primarily represented $8 million of royalty income; a $4 million gain associated with the acquisition of a Canadian distribution center lease and related assets from the partial exchange of a note that had been previously written down to zero; a $2 million gain related to the sale of a building; and a $1 million gain on our available-for-sale security; partially offset by a $2 million of net benefit expense relating to our pension and post retirement programs; and a $1 million loss related to our equity method investment.

Income Taxes

Our effective tax rate for 2019 was 27.0 percent, as compared with 24.1 percent in 2018. The increase was primarily due to discrete events, including the effects of the U.S. tax reform, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, informally known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). 

​

In connection with the finalization of our accounting for the Tax Act, in 2019 we recorded a charge for $2 million representing an adjustment to U.S. tax on foreign income and in 2018 we recorded a $28 million benefit. See also Note 17, Income Taxes, under “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for more information.

​

During the fourth quarters of 2019 and 2018, we recorded a tax benefit of $2 million and a tax expense of $4 million, respectively, in connection with tax law changes in the Netherlands.

​

In 2019, we established a valuation allowance of $2 million to offset the deferred tax benefit of certain foreign tax losses. 

​

We regularly assess the adequacy of provisions for income tax contingencies in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance on accounting for income taxes. As a result, reserves for unrecognized tax benefits may be adjusted due to new facts and developments, such as changes to interpretations of relevant tax law, assessments from taxing authorities, settlements with taxing authorities, and lapses of statutes of limitations. The changes in the tax reserves were not significant in 2019. The effective tax rate for 2018 includes reserve releases totaling $5 million due to audit settlements and lapses of statutes of limitations. 

Excluding the above-mentioned discrete items, the effective tax rate for 2019 increased slightly as compared with 2018, due to mix of income earned in various jurisdictions.

​

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Liquidity

Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow from operations, while the principal uses of cash have been to fund inventory and other working capital requirements; finance capital expenditures related to store openings, store remodelings, internet and mobile sites, information systems, and other support facilities; make retirement plan contributions, quarterly dividend payments, and interest payments; and fund other cash requirements to support the development of our short-term and long-term operating strategies. We generally finance real estate with operating leases. We believe our cash, cash equivalents, future cash flow from operations, and amounts available under our credit agreement will be adequate to fund these requirements. On March 19, 2020, in order to increase our cash position and help preserve our financial flexibility, we have drawn $330 million of our credit facility. This is a precautionary measure in light of current uncertainty in the global markets resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

​

2019 Form 10-K Page 26

​ 

​

The Company may also from time to time repurchase its common stock or seek to retire or purchase outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise. Such repurchases and retirement of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors. The amounts involved may be material. As of February 1, 2020, approximately $867 million remained available under our current $1.2 billion share repurchase program. 

On February 19, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share to be paid on May 2, 2020, representing a 5 percent increase over the previous quarterly per share amount.

Any material adverse change in customer demand, fashion trends, competitive market forces, or customer acceptance of our merchandise mix and retail locations, uncertainties related to the effect of competitive products and pricing, our reliance on a few key suppliers for a significant portion of our merchandise purchases and risks associated with global product sourcing, economic conditions worldwide, the effects of currency fluctuations, uncertainties caused by COVID-19, as well as other factors listed under the heading “Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” could affect our ability to continue to fund our liquidity needs from business operations.

Maintaining access to merchandise that we consider appropriate for our business may be subject to the policies and practices of our key suppliers. Therefore, we believe that it is critical to continue to maintain satisfactory relationships with these key suppliers. We purchased approximately 91 percent and 90 percent of our merchandise from our top five suppliers in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and expect to continue to obtain a significant percentage of our athletic product from these suppliers in future periods. Approximately 71 percent and 66 percent was purchased from one supplier, Nike, Inc., in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Planned capital expenditures in 2020 are $271 million, with additional lease acquisition costs related to our operations in Europe of $4 million. However, due to the current events related to COVID-19, we are currently reevaluating our total capital spending plans. Included in the planned amount is $148 million dedicated to elevating our customers’ in-store experience through continued relocation and remodels in major cities and key markets. It includes the remodeling or expansion of approximately 125 existing stores, as well as the planned opening of approximately 65 new stores, including the continued expansion of our community-based “power” store format, which provides a pinnacle retail experience that delivers connected customer interactions through service, experience, product, and a sense of community. Capital spending for our expansion in Asia is also included. The capital plan for 2020 also includes $123 million for digital and other investments, including additional enhancements to our mobile and web platforms, expanding data analytics capabilities, and supply chain initiatives. We have the ability to revise and reschedule much of the anticipated capital expenditure program should our financial position require it. 

Operating Activities[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The amount provided by operating activities reflects income adjusted for non-cash items and working capital changes. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include non-cash impairment charges, non-cash gains, depreciation and amortization, deferred income taxes, and share-based compensation expense. 

The decline in cash provided by operating activities in 2019 compared with the prior year reflected a decrease to net income and lower inflows associated with changes in working capital. During 2019, we contributed $55 million to our U.S. qualified pension plan, as compared with $128 million in 2018. The amounts and timing of pension contributions are dependent on several factors, including asset performance. 

Cash paid for income taxes was $201 million, $184 million, and $237 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Investing Activities[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Capital expenditures in 2019 of $187 million was consistent with the prior year. During 2019, we completed the remodeling or relocation of 148 existing stores and opened 67 new stores. 

Investing activities for 2019 included $50 million related to various minority investments as compared with $89 million in 2018. Also included in 2019 is $2 million related to the sale of a building. Investing activities for 2018 included $2 million received in insurance proceeds for fixed assets from an insurance claim relating to Hurricane Maria. 

Financing Activities[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Cash used in financing activities consisted primarily of our return to shareholders initiatives, including our share repurchase program and cash dividend payments, as follows:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

During 2019, we repurchased 8,374,523 shares of our common stock under our share repurchase programs. Additionally, we declared and paid dividends representing a quarterly rate of $0.38 per share in 2019. During 2019, we paid $2 million to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to the vesting of share-based equity awards. Offsetting the amounts above were proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and treasury stock in connection with the employee stock programs of $8 million for 2019.

Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP measure)

In addition to net cash provided by operating activities, we use free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of our financial strength and our ability to generate cash. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures (which is classified as an investing activity). We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is not defined under U.S. GAAP. Therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. It should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures.

The following table presents a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.

Capital Structure

On May 19, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with our banks (“2016 Credit Agreement”). The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a $400 million asset-based revolving credit facility maturing on May 19, 2021. During the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement, we may also increase the commitments by up to $200 million, subject to customary conditions. Interest is determined, at our option, by the federal funds rate plus a margin of 0.125 percent to 0.375 percent, or a Eurodollar rate, determined by reference to LIBOR, plus a margin of 1.125 percent to 1.375 percent depending on availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement. In addition, we are paying a commitment fee of 0.20 percent per annum on the unused portion of the commitments.

The 2016 Credit Agreement provides for a security interest in certain of our domestic store assets, including inventory assets, accounts receivable, cash deposits, and certain insurance proceeds. We are not required to comply with any financial covenants unless certain events of default have occurred and are continuing, or if availability under the 2016 Credit Agreement does not exceed the greater of $40 million and 10 percent of the Loan Cap (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement). There are no restrictions relating to the payment of dividends and share repurchases as long as no default or event of default has occurred and the aggregate principal amount of unused commitments under the 2016 Credit Agreement is not less than 15 percent of the lesser of the aggregate amount of the commitments and the Borrowing Base, determined as of the preceding fiscal month and on a proforma basis for the following six fiscal months. 

Credit Rating

As of March 27, 2020, our corporate credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service are BB+ and Ba1, respectively. In addition, Moody’s Investors Service has rated our senior unsecured notes Ba2.

Debt Capitalization and Equity (non-GAAP Measure)

Historically for purposes of calculating debt to total capitalization, we included the present value of operating lease commitments in total net debt and therefore it was considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Operating leases are the primary financing vehicle used to fund store expansion and, therefore, we believed that the inclusion of the present value of operating leases in total debt was useful to our investors, credit constituencies, and rating agencies. In 2019, we adopted the new lease accounting standard which requires leases to be recorded on the balance sheet. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

(1)The determination of the capitalized operating leases prior to the adoption of the new lease accounting standard was calculated on a lease-by-lease basis and represented the best estimate of the lease liability using various discount rates ranging from 1.7 percent to 14.5 percent. 

Including the present value of operating leases, net debt capitalization percent decreased by 230 basis points in 2019, primarily reflecting shorter average lease terms, additional stores that are operating on a month-to-month basis, additional stores paying variable rents, and foreign exchange fluctuations.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments

The following tables represent the scheduled maturities of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at February 1, 2020:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

(1)The amounts presented above represent the contractual maturities of our long-term debt, including interest; however, it excludes the unamortized gain of the interest rate swap of $6 million. Additional information is included in the Long-Term Debt note under “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” 

(2)The amounts presented represent the future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases. Amounts do not include $35 million of minimum future payments for leases which have not yet commenced. In addition to minimum rent, certain of our leases require the payment of additional costs for insurance, maintenance, percentage rent, and other costs. These additional amounts are excluded from the table of contractual commitments as the amounts are variable and the timing and/or amounts of such payments are unknown. 

(3)Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at February 1, 2020 primarily comprise income taxes, workers’ compensation and general liability reserves, and various other accruals. Other than these liabilities, other amounts (including our unrecognized tax benefits of $45 million) have been excluded from the table above as the timing and/or amount of any cash payment is uncertain. Remaining amounts for which the timing is known have not been included as they are minimal and not useful to the presentation. 

​

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

​

(1)Represents open purchase orders, as well as other commitments for merchandise purchases, at February 1, 2020. We are obligated under the terms of purchase orders; however, we are generally able to renegotiate the timing and quantity of these orders with certain suppliers in response to shifts in consumer preferences or other factors.

(2)Represents payments required by non-merchandise purchase agreements.

​

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities that expose the Company to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or any other obligation under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. Also, our financial policies prohibit the use of derivatives for which there is no underlying exposure.

In connection with the sale of various businesses and assets, we may be obligated for certain lease commitments transferred to third parties and pursuant to certain normal representations, warranties, or indemnifications entered into with the purchasers of such businesses or assets. Although the maximum potential amounts for such obligations cannot be readily determined, we believe that the resolution of such contingencies will not significantly affect our consolidated financial position, liquidity, or results of operations. We also operate certain stores for which lease agreements are in the process of being negotiated with landlords. Although there is no contractual commitment to make these payments, it is likely that leases will be executed.

Critical Accounting Policies

Our responsibility for integrity and objectivity in the preparation and presentation of the financial statements requires application of appropriate accounting policies. Generally, our accounting policies and methods are those specifically required by U.S. GAAP. Included in the Summary of Significant Accounting Policies note in “Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” is a summary of the most significant accounting policies. In some cases, we are required to calculate amounts based on estimates for matters that are inherently uncertain. We believe the following to be the most critical of those accounting policies that necessitate subjective judgments.

Merchandise Inventories and Cost of Sales

Merchandise inventories for our stores are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail inventory method (“RIM”). The RIM is used by retail companies to value inventories at cost and calculate gross margins due to its practicality. Under the RIM, cost is determined by applying a cost-to-retail percentage across groupings of similar items, known as departments. The cost-to-retail percentage is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory on a department basis.

The RIM is a system of averages that requires estimates and assumptions regarding markups, markdowns and shrink, among others, and as such, could result in distortions of inventory amounts. Judgment is required for these estimates and assumptions, as well as to differentiate between promotional and other markdowns that may be required to correctly reflect merchandise inventories at the lower of cost or market. Reserves are established based on current selling prices when the inventory has not been marked down to market. The failure to take permanent markdowns on a timely basis may result in an overstatement of cost under the retail inventory method. The decision to take permanent markdowns includes many factors, including the current retail environment, inventory levels, and the age of the item. We believe this method and its related assumptions, which have been consistently applied, to be reasonable.

Leases  

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term for those arrangements where there is an identified asset and the contract conveys the right to control its use. Our lease term includes options to extend or terminate a lease only when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.

As most of our leases do not provide an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the remaining lease term to determine the present value of future lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Our incremental borrowing rate is calculated as the weighted average risk-free (sovereign) rate plus a spread to reflect our current unsecured credit rating plus the fees to borrow under our existing credit facility. The weighted average risk-free (sovereign) rates were based on the Treasury BVAL rates curve in Bloomberg. In the regions that we have stores, rates were developed for 3, 5, 7, 10, and 15 years. The weighting given to each region was determined by the number of stores in each region. 

The spread to reflect our current credit rating represented the spread between U.S. Treasury rates and Bloomberg’s USD BVAL curve for non-financial companies with the Company’s credit rating. The fees to borrow represent the facility fees paid on the Company’s revolving credit facility, which is 20 basis points. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Tangible Assets and Right-of-Use Assets

​

We perform an impairment review when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of long-lived tangible assets and right-of-use assets may not be recoverable (“a triggering event”). Our policy for determining whether a triggering event exists comprises the evaluation of measurable operating performance criteria and qualitative measures at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of cash flows of other assets and liabilities, which is at the store level. We also evaluate for triggering events at the banner level. If an impairment review is necessitated by the identification of a triggering event, we determine the fair value of the asset using assumptions predominately identified from our historical performance and our long-range strategic plans. To determine if an impairment exists, we compare the carrying amount of the asset with the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group with its estimated fair value. The estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate and by using a market approach to determine current lease rates. Future expected cash flows are based upon estimates that, if not achieved, may result in significantly different results. 

​

During 2019, we conducted an impairment review of the Footaction store-level assets as well as other underperforming stores, including a vacant store that had been previously subleased, and recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $37 million. Also during 2019, we recorded a $13 million charge related to the closing of our SIX:02 business. During 2018, we conducted an impairment review of the Runners Point, Sidestep, and SIX:02 store-level assets and recorded non-cash impairment charges totaling $4 million.

Recoverability of Goodwill[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Pension and Postretirement Liabilities

We review all assumptions used to determine our obligations for pension and postretirement liabilities annually with our independent actuaries, taking into consideration existing and future economic conditions and our intentions with regard to the plans. The assumptions used are:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to estimate taxable income for future years by taxing jurisdiction and to use our judgment to determine whether to record a valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset. Estimates of taxable income are based upon our long-range strategic plans. 

​

A one percent change in the overall statutory tax rate for 2019 would have resulted in a change of $3 million to the carrying value of the net deferred tax asset and a corresponding charge or credit to income tax expense depending on whether the tax rate change was a decrease or an increase. 

​

We have operations in multiple taxing jurisdictions, and we are subject to audit in these jurisdictions. Tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve. Accruals of tax contingencies require us to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of tax audits. Actual results could vary from these estimates. 

2019 Form 10-K Page 33

​ 

​

Excluding the effect of any nonrecurring items that may occur, we expect the 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 27.5 to 28 percent. The actual tax rate will vary if the level of stock option exercise activity and the stock price at the vesting or exercise date differs from our expectations. Additionally, the tax rate will also depend on the level and mix of income earned in the United States, as compared with our international operations.
