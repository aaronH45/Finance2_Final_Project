Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As of March 31, 2020, our long-term debt totaled $10.59 billion. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $5.86 billion as of March 31, 2020. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $4.73 billion balance of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of March 31, 2020. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $23.6 million.
