PART I

ITEM 1.BUSINESS

 ABOUT PFIZER 

Pfizer Inc. is a research-based, global biopharmaceutical company. We apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives through the discovery, development, manufacture and distribution of healthcare products, including innovative medicines and vaccines. We work across developed and emerging markets to advance wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most feared diseases of our time. We collaborate with healthcare providers, governments and local communities to support and expand access to reliable, affordable healthcare around the world. Our revenues are derived from the sale of our products and, to a much lesser extent, from alliance agreements, under which we co-promote products discovered or developed by other companies or us. The majority of our revenues come from the manufacture and sale of biopharmaceutical products. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on June 2, 1942. 

We believe that our medicines provide significant value for both healthcare providers and patients, not only from the improved treatment of diseases but also from a reduction in other healthcare costs, such as emergency room or hospitalization costs, as well as improvements in health, wellness and productivity. We continue to actively engage in dialogues about the value of our medicines and how we can best work with patients, physicians and payers to prevent and treat disease and improve outcomes. We continue to work within the current legal and pricing structures, as well as continue to review our pricing arrangements and contracting methods with payers, to maximize patient access and minimize any adverse impact on our revenues. We remain firmly committed to fulfilling our Company’s purpose: Breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. By doing so, we expect to create value for the patients we serve and for our colleagues and shareholders. 

With the formation of the GSK Consumer Healthcare joint venture and the pending combination of Upjohn with Mylan, which are further discussed below, Pfizer is transforming itself into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines.

We are committed to capitalizing on growth opportunities by advancing our own pipeline and maximizing the value of our in-line products, as well as through various forms of business development, which can include alliances, licenses, joint ventures, collaborations, equity- or debt-based investments, dispositions, mergers and acquisitions. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies, and we seek to generate earnings growth and enhance shareholder value by pursuing a disciplined, strategic and financial approach to evaluating business development opportunities. 

Our significant recent business development activities include:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Formation of a New Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture—On July 31, 2019, we completed the transaction in which we and GSK combined our respective consumer healthcare businesses into a new consumer healthcare joint venture that operates globally under the GSK Consumer Healthcare name. The joint venture is a category leader in pain relief, respiratory and vitamins, minerals and supplements, and therapeutic oral health and is the largest global OTC consumer healthcare business. In exchange for contributing our Consumer Healthcare business to the joint venture, we received a 32% equity stake in the new company and GSK owns the remaining 68%. 

•Acquisition of Array BioPharma Inc.—On July 30, 2019, we acquired Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need, for $48 per share in cash. The total fair value of the consideration transferred for Array was approximately $11.2 billion ($10.9 billion, net of cash acquired). 

•Agreement to Combine Upjohn with Mylan N.V.—On July 29, 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan, creating a new global pharmaceutical company, Viatris. Under the terms of the agreement, which is structured as an all-stock, Reverse Morris Trust transaction, Upjohn is expected to be spun off or split off to Pfizer’s shareholders and, immediately thereafter, combined with Mylan. Pfizer shareholders would own 57% of the combined new company, and former Mylan shareholders would own 43%. The transaction is expected to be tax free to Pfizer and Pfizer shareholders. The transaction is anticipated to close in mid-2020, subject to Mylan shareholder approval and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K1
•Acquisition of Therachon Holding AG—On July 1, 2019, we acquired all the remaining shares of Therachon Holding AG, a privately-held clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on rare diseases, with assets in development for the treatment of achondroplasia, a genetic condition and the most common form of short-limb dwarfism, for $340 million upfront, plus potential milestone payments of up to $470 million, contingent on the achievement of key milestones in the development and commercialization of the lead asset.

Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of the countries in which we operate. In the U.S., the principal authority regulating our operations is the FDA. The FDA regulates the safety and efficacy of the products we offer and our research, quality, manufacturing processes, product promotion, advertising and product labeling. Similar regulations exist in most other countries, and in many countries the government also regulates our prices. In the EU, the EMA conducts the scientific evaluation, supervision and safety monitoring of our products, and employs a centralized procedure for approval of medicines for the EU and the European Economic Area countries. In China, the NMPA is the primary regulatory authority for approving and supervising medicines. In Japan, the PMDA is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, post-marketing reviews and pharmaceutical safety. Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

COLLABORATION AND CO-PROMOTION AGREEMENTS

We are party to collaboration and/or co-promotion agreements relating to certain biopharmaceutical products, including, among others, Eliquis, Xtandi and Bavencio. Revenues from Eliquis (except in certain markets where we have direct sales), Xtandi and Bavencio are included in alliance revenues. 

Eliquis has been jointly developed and is commercialized by Pfizer and BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales. We have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients.

Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi. Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market. In addition, Pfizer and Astellas share certain development and other collaboration expenses, and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales (recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net). Xtandi is an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within tumor cells. 

Bavencio (avelumab) is being developed and commercialized in collaboration with Merck KGaA. Both companies jointly fund the majority of development and commercialization costs, and split equally any profits related to net sales generated from selling any products containing avelumab from this collaboration. Bavencio is a human anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) antibody.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Innovation is critical to the success of our Company, and drug discovery and development are time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. Pfizer’s purpose is to deliver breakthroughs that change patients’ lives. R&D is at the heart of fulfilling Pfizer’s purpose as we work to translate advanced science and technologies into the therapies that matter most. 

Our R&D Priorities and Strategy

Our R&D priorities include:

•delivering a pipeline of highly differentiated medicines and vaccines where Pfizer has a unique opportunity to bring the most important new therapies to patients in need;

•advancing our capabilities that can position Pfizer for long-term R&D leadership; and

•advancing new models for partnerships with creativity, flexibility and urgency to deliver innovation to patients as quickly as possible.

To that end, our R&D primarily focuses on:

•Oncology;

•Inflammation and Immunology;

•Vaccines;

•Internal Medicine;

•Rare Diseases; and

•Hospital.

While a significant portion of R&D is done internally, we continue to seek out promising chemical and biological lead molecules and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects, as well as our product lines. We do so by entering into collaboration, alliance and license agreements with other companies, as well as leveraging acquisitions and equity- or debt-based investments. These agreements enable us to co-develop, license or acquire promising compounds, technologies and/or capabilities. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which a third party agrees to fund a portion of the development costs of one or more of our pipeline products in exchange for rights to receive potential milestone payments, revenue sharing payments, profit sharing payments and/or royalties. Collaboration, alliance, license and funding agreements and equity- or debt-based investments allow us to share risk and cost. They also enable us to access external scientific and technological expertise, as well as provide us the opportunity to advance our own products and in-licensed or acquired products.

For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements in our 2019 Financial Report.

Our R&D Operations

We conduct R&D internally and also through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies and in cooperation with other pharmaceutical firms. In 2019, we continued to strengthen our global R&D organization and pursue strategies intended to improve innovation and overall productivity in R&D to achieve a sustainable pipeline that is positioned to deliver value in the near term and over time. 

Our R&D spending is conducted through a number of matrix organizations:

•Research Units within our WRDM organization are generally responsible for research and early-stage development assets for our Biopharma business (assets that have not yet achieved proof-of-concept). Our Research Units are organized by therapeutic area to enhance flexibility, cohesiveness and focus. Because of our structure, we are able to rapidly redeploy resources within a Research Unit between various projects as necessary because in many instances the workforce shares similar skills, expertise and/or focus. 

•Our science-based and other platform-services organizations provide technical expertise and other services to the various R&D projects, and are organized into science-based functions (which are part of our WRDM organization), such as Pharmaceutical Sciences, Medicine Design, and non-science-based functions, such as Facilities, Digital and Finance. Within each of these functions, we are able to migrate resources among projects, candidates and/or targets in any therapeutic area and in most phases of development, allowing us to react quickly in response to evolving needs. In addition, the Worldwide Medical and Safety group, within WRDM, ensures that Pfizer provides all stakeholders––including patients, healthcare providers, pharmacists, payers and health authorities––with complete and up-to-date information on the risks and benefits associated with Pfizer products so that they can make appropriate decisions on how and when to use Pfizer’s medicines. 

•Our R&D organization within Upjohn supports the off-patent branded and generic established medicines and helps to develop product enhancements, new indications and new market registrations for these medicines.

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K6
•Our Global Product Development (GPD) organization is a unified center for clinical development and regulatory activities that is generally responsible for the clinical development strategy and operational execution of clinical trials for both early-stage assets in the WRDM portfolio as well as late-stage assets in the Biopharma portfolio. 

We manage R&D operations on a total-company basis through our matrix organizations described above. Specifically, the Portfolio Strategy & Investment committee, comprised of senior executives, is accountable for aligning resources among all of our WRDM, GPD and Biopharma R&D projects and for seeking to ensure optimal capital allocation across the innovative R&D portfolio. We believe that this approach also serves to maximize accountability and flexibility. Our Upjohn R&D organization manages its resources separately from the WRDM and GPD organizations, with operational support from GPD for select clinical development regulatory activities and from WRDM for clinical supply operations and global pharmacovigilance processing.

Generally, we do not disaggregate total R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area since, as described above, we do not manage our R&D operations by development phase or by therapeutic area. Further, as we are able to adjust a significant portion of our spending quickly, we believe that any prior-period information about R&D expense by development phase or by therapeutic area would not necessarily be representative of future spending.

For additional information on our R&D operations and expenses, see the Costs and Expenses—Research and Development (R&D) Expenses section in our 2019 Financial Report.

Our R&D Pipeline and Competition

The discovery and development of safe, effective new products, as well as the development of additional uses for existing products, are necessary for the continued strength of our businesses. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development. The process from discovery to development to regulatory approval can take more than ten years. 

As of January 28, 2020, we had the following number of projects in various stages of R&D: 

Development of a single compound is often pursued as part of multiple programs. While these drug candidates may or may not eventually receive regulatory approval, new drug candidates entering clinical development phases are the foundation for future products. In addition to discovering and developing new products, our R&D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness, enhancing ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications for them.

Information concerning several of our drug candidates in development, as well as supplemental filings for existing products, is set forth in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Developments––Biopharmaceutical section in our 2019 Financial Report, which is incorporated by reference.

Our competitors also devote substantial funds and resources to R&D. We also compete against numerous small biotechnology companies in developing potential drug candidates. The extent to which our competitors are successful in their research could result in erosion of the sales of our existing products and potential sales of products in development, as well as unanticipated product obsolescence. In addition, several of our competitors operate without large R&D expenses and make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. For additional information, see the Competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Competitive Products sections in this 2019 Form 10-K.

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K7
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

We have significant operations outside the U.S. In 2019, operations in developed and emerging markets were managed through our business segments: Biopharma, Upjohn and, through July 31, 2019, Consumer Healthcare. Emerging markets are an important component of our strategy for global leadership, and our commercial structure recognizes that the demographics and rising economic power of the fastest-growing emerging markets are becoming more closely aligned with the profile found within developed markets. Urbanization and the rise of the middle class in emerging markets, particularly in Asia, provide growth opportunities for our medicines. 

We sell our products in over 125 countries. Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $27.9 billion accounted for 54% of our total revenues in 2019. Revenues exceeded $500 million in each of eleven countries outside the U.S. in 2019, 2018 and 2017. By total revenues, China and Japan are our two largest national markets outside the U.S. For a geographic breakdown of revenues, see the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues—Overview and —Revenues by Operating Segment and Geography sections and the table captioned Geographic Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 17. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information in our 2019 Financial Report. 

Our international operations are subject, in varying degrees, to a number of risks inherent in carrying on business in other countries, including, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange control regulations and expropriation and other restrictive government actions. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors—International Operations section in this 2019 Form 10-K. Our international businesses are also subject to government-imposed constraints, including laws and regulations on pricing, reimbursement, and access to our products. See the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States section in this 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of these matters.

Depending on the direction of change relative to the U.S. dollar, foreign currency values can increase or decrease the reported dollar value of our net assets and results of operations. While we cannot predict with certainty future changes in foreign exchange rates or the effect they will have on us, we attempt to mitigate their impact through operational means and by using various financial instruments, depending upon market conditions. For additional information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7F. Financial Instruments: Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities in our 2019 Financial Report, which is incorporated by reference, as well as Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Financial Risk Management section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

MARKETING

In our global biopharmaceutical businesses, we promote our products to healthcare providers and patients. Through our marketing organizations, we explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products to healthcare providers, such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and pharmacists; MCOs that provide insurance coverage, such as hospitals, Integrated Delivery Systems, PBMs and health plans; and employers and government agencies who hire MCOs to provide health benefits to their employees. We also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that seeks to communicate the approved uses, benefits and risks of our products while motivating people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, we sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, prevention and wellness, important public health issues, and our patient assistance programs.

Our prescription pharmaceutical products are sold principally to wholesalers, but we also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies, and, in the case of our vaccines products in the U.S., we primarily sell directly to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wholesalers, individual provider offices, retail pharmacies, and integrated delivery networks. We seek to gain access for our products on healthcare authority and PBM formularies, which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the PBMs. PBMs use various benefit designs, such as tiered co-pays for formulary 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K8
products, to drive utilization of products in preferred formulary positions. We may also work with payers on disease management programs that help to develop tools and materials to educate patients and physicians on key disease areas.

In 2019, our top three biopharmaceutical wholesalers accounted for approximately 37% of our total revenues (and approximately 79% of our total U.S. revenues).

PATENTS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

Our products are sold around the world under brand-name, logo and certain product design trademarks that we consider, in the aggregate, to be of material importance to Pfizer. Trademark protection continues in some countries for as long as the mark is used and, in other countries, for as long as it is registered. Registrations generally are for fixed, but renewable, terms.

We own or license a number of U.S. and foreign patents. These patents cover pharmaceutical and other products and their uses, pharmaceutical formulations, product manufacturing processes and intermediate chemical compounds used in manufacturing.

Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. Further, patent term extension may be available in many major countries to compensate for a regulatory delay in approval of the product. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States—Intellectual Property section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

In various markets, a period of regulatory exclusivity may be provided to certain drugs upon approval. The scope and term of such exclusivity will vary but, in general, the period of regulatory exclusivity will run concurrently with the term of any existing patent rights associated with the drug at the time of approval.

In the aggregate, our patent and related rights are of material importance to our businesses in the U.S. and most other countries. Based on current product sales, and considering the vigorous competition with products sold by our competitors, the patent rights we consider most significant in relation to our business as a whole, together with the year in which the basic product patent expires (including, where applicable, grant of an additional six-month pediatric extension and/or the granted patent term extension in the U.S. and Japan and Supplementary Patent Certificate in Europe), are those for the medicines set forth in the table below. Unless otherwise indicated, the years set forth in the table below pertain to the basic product patent expiration for the respective products. Patent term extensions, supplementary protection certificates and pediatric exclusivity periods are not reflected in the expiration dates listed in the table below, unless they have been granted by the issuing authority. In some instances, there are later-expiring patents relating to our products directed to particular forms or compositions, to methods of manufacturing, or to use of the drug in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions. However, in some cases, such patents may not protect our drug from generic or, as applicable, biosimilar competition after the expiration of the basic patent.

The loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a significant adverse effect on our revenues. Many of our branded products have multiple patents that expire at varying dates, thereby strengthening our overall patent protection. However, once patent protection has expired or has been lost prior to the expiration date as a result of a legal challenge, we typically lose exclusivity on these products, and generic and biosimilar pharmaceutical manufacturers generally produce identical or highly similar products and sell them for a lower price. The date at which generic or biosimilar competition commences may be different from the date that the patent or regulatory exclusivity expires. However, when generic or biosimilar competition does commence, the resulting price competition can substantially decrease our revenues for the impacted products, often in a very short period of time. In some cases, however, we can continue to obtain commercial benefits from product manufacturing trade secrets; patents on uses for products; patents on processes and intermediates for the economical manufacture of the active ingredients; patents for special formulations of the product or delivery mechanisms; or conversion of the active ingredient to OTC products.

Also, if one of our patents is found to be invalid by judicial, court or administrative proceedings, such as inter partes review, post-grant review, re-examination or opposition proceedings, before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the European Patent Office, or other foreign counterparts, generic or competitive products could be introduced into the market resulting in the erosion of sales of our existing products. For example, several of the patents in our pneumococcal vaccine portfolio were challenged in inter partes review and post-grant review proceedings in the U.S. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Patent Protection section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

Companies have filed applications with the FDA seeking approval of product candidates that such companies claim either do not infringe our patents or our patents are invalid; these include candidates that would compete with, among other products, Eliquis, Ibrance and Xeljanz. We will continue to aggressively defend our patent rights whenever we deem appropriate. For additional

information, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16A1. Contingencies and Certain Commitments—Legal Proceedings––Patent Litigation in our 2019 Financial Report.

Recent Losses and Expected Losses of Product Exclusivity

Certain of our current products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years. For example, as a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva launched a generic version of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017. Lyrica lost patent protection in the U.S. in June 2019 and multi-source generic competition began in July 2019. Also, the basic product patent for Chantix in the U.S. will expire in November 2020. See the table above for the basic product patent expiries of our most significant products.

We expect the impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries will be significant in 2020, then moderating downward to a much lower level from 2021 through 2025. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Dependence on Key In-Line Products section in this 2019 Form 10-K. 

The following table provides information about certain products recently experiencing, or expected to experience in 2020, patent expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in the U.S., Europe or Japan. Our financial results in 2019 and our financial guidance for 2020 reflect the impact of the loss of exclusivity of various products discussed below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Unless otherwise noted, “Key Dates” indicate patent-based expiration dates.

(b) As a result of a patent litigation settlement, Teva launched a generic version of Viagra in the U.S. in December 2017.

(c) Lyrica lost patent protection in the U.S. in June 2019 and multi-source generic competition began in July 2019. 

(d) As a result of a patent litigation settlement with several generic manufacturers, generic versions of Pristiq launched in the U.S. in March 2017.

(e) The basic product patent for Chantix in the U.S. will expire in November 2020, which includes the FDA’s grant of pediatric exclusivity that extended the period of market exclusivity in the U.S. for Chantix for an additional six months from May 2020.

Biologic Products

Our biologic products, including BeneFIX, ReFacto, Xyntha, Bavencio, Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 and Enbrel (we market Enbrel outside the U.S. and Canada), already face, or may face in the future, competition from biosimilars (also referred to as follow-on biologics). In the U.S., such biosimilars would reference our originator biologic products approved under the U.S. Public Health Service Act. Additionally, the FDA has approved a follow-on recombinant human growth hormone that referenced our biotechnology product, Genotropin, that was approved under the FFDCA.

Biosimilars are versions of biologic medicines that have been developed and proven to be highly similar to the original biologic in terms of safety and efficacy and that have no clinically meaningful differences in safety, purity or potency. Biosimilars have the potential to offer high-quality, lower-cost alternatives to biologic medicines. Abbreviated legal pathways for the approval of biosimilars exist in certain international markets and, since the passage of the ACA in 2010, a framework for such approval exists in the U.S. In Europe, the European Commission grants marketing authorizations for biosimilars pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals. 

As part of our business strategy, we are capitalizing on our expertise in biologics manufacturing, as well as our regulatory and commercial strengths, to develop and commercialize biosimilar medicines. Some of the biosimilars that we currently market include Inflectra, Nivestym, Retacrit, Zirabev, Ruxience and Trazimera in the U.S.; Inflectra, Retacrit, Nivestim and Trazimera in the EU; and Ixifi, Trazimera, Zirabev and Ruxience in Japan. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Biosimilars section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K11
We may face litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our biologic products. Likewise, as we develop, manufacture and seek to launch biosimilars, patents may be asserted against us.

International

One of the main limitations on our operations in some countries outside the U.S. is the lack of effective intellectual property protection for our products. Under international and U.S. free trade agreements in recent years, we have seen some improvement in global protection of intellectual property rights. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—Outside the United States—Intellectual Property section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

COMPETITION

Our businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our prescription pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs or biosimilars that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Though the means of competition vary among product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.

Our competitors include other worldwide research-based biopharmaceutical companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus and generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our major products.

This competition affects our core product business, which is focused on applying innovative science to discover and market products that satisfy unmet medical needs and provide therapeutic improvements. Our emphasis on innovation is underscored by our multi-billion-dollar investment in R&D, as well as our business development transactions, both designed to result in a strong product pipeline. Our investment in research does not stop with drug approval; we continue to invest in further demonstrating the value of our products for the conditions they treat, as well as potential new applications. We seek to protect the health and well-being of patients by striving to ensure that medically sound knowledge of the benefits and risks of our medicines is understood and communicated to patients, physicians, payers and global health authorities. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our biopharmaceutical functions, including coordinating support for our efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products to our customers.

Operating conditions have become more challenging under mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We believe that we have taken an industry-leading role in evolving our approaches to U.S. direct-to-consumer advertising, interactions with, and payments to, healthcare professionals, and medical education grants. We also continue to sponsor programs to address patient affordability and access barriers, as we strive to advance fundamental health system change through support for better healthcare solutions.

Our vaccines business may face competition from the introduction of alternative vaccines. For example, Prevnar 13 may face competition in the form of competitor vaccines, including vaccines with additional serotypes or “next-generation” pneumococcal conjugate vaccines prior to or after the expiration of its patents, which may adversely affect our future results.

Our generics and biosimilars businesses compete with branded products from competitors, as well as other generics and biosimilars manufacturers. Globally, Pfizer sells generic versions of Pfizer’s, as well as certain competitors’, solid oral dose and sterile injectable pharmaceutical products. We also sell biosimilars of certain inflammation & immunology and oncology biologic medicines globally. We seek to maximize the opportunity to establish a “first-to-market” or early market position for our generic injectable drugs and biosimilars, as a “first-to-market” position provides customers a lower-cost alternative immediately when available and also may provide us with potentially higher levels of sales and profitability until other generic or biosimilar competitors enter the market. 

Managed Care Organizations

The evolution of managed care in the U.S. has been a major factor in the competitive makeup of the healthcare marketplace. Approximately 300 million people in the U.S. now have some form of health insurance coverage. Due to the expansion of health insurance coverage (see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States section in this 2019 Form 10-K), the marketing of prescription drugs to both consumers and the entities that manage this expanded coverage in the U.S. continues to grow in importance.

The influence of MCOs has increased in recent years due to the growing number of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the same time, those organizations have been consolidating into fewer, even larger entities. This consolidation enhances both their ability to negotiate, as well as their importance to Pfizer.

The growth of MCOs has increased pressure on drug prices as well as revenues. One objective of MCOs is to contain and, where possible, reduce healthcare expenditures. MCOs typically negotiate prices with pharmaceutical providers by using 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K12
formularies (which are lists of approved medicines available to members of the MCOs), clinical protocols (requiring prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or requiring the patient to first fail on one or more generic products before permitting access to a branded medicine), volume purchasing, long-term contracts and their ability to influence volume and market share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded medicines on higher-tier status in their formularies (leading to higher patient co-pays) or non-preferred tier status, MCOs transfer a portion of the cost of the medicine to the patient, resulting in significant out-of-pocket expenses for the patient, especially for chronic treatments. This financial disincentive is a tool for MCOs to manage drug costs and channel patients to medicines preferred by the MCOs. MCOs also use additional measures such as new-to-market blocks, exclusion lists, indication-based pricing and “copay accumulator” programs to improve their cost containment efforts. We are closely monitoring these newer approaches and developing appropriate strategies to respond to them.

Due to their generally lower cost, generic medicines typically are placed in lowest cost tiers of MCO formularies. The breadth of the products covered by formularies can vary considerably from one MCO to another, and many formularies include alternative and competitive products for treatment of particular medical problems. 

Exclusion of a product from a formulary or other MCO-implemented restrictions can significantly impact drug usage in the MCO patient population and beyond. Consequently, pharmaceutical companies compete to gain access to formularies for their products. Unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, are generally beneficial to achieving access to formularies. However, lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. We have been generally, although not universally, successful in having our major products included on MCO formularies. However, increasingly our branded products are being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. 

MCOs also emphasize primary and preventive care, out-patient treatment and procedures performed at doctors’ offices and clinics as another way to manage costs. Hospitalization and surgery, typically the most expensive forms of treatment, are carefully managed. Since the use of certain drugs can reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy, or even surgery, such drugs can become favored first-line treatments for certain diseases. 

The ACA has accelerated payment reform by distributing risk across MCOs and other stakeholders in care delivery with the intent of improving quality while reducing costs, which creates pressure on MCOs to tie reimbursement to defined outcomes. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business—Government Regulation and Price Constraints—In the United States—Healthcare Reform section in this 2019 Form 10-K.

Generic Products

One of the biggest competitive challenges that our branded products face is from generic pharmaceutical manufacturers. Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection for a product, especially a small molecule product, we can lose the major portion of revenues for that product in a very short period of time. Several competitors make a regular practice of challenging our product patents before their expiration. Generic competitors often operate without large R&D expenses, as well as without costs of conveying medical information about products to the medical community. In addition, the FDA approval process exempts generics from costly and time-consuming clinical trials to demonstrate their safety and efficacy, allowing generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product. Generic competitors can market a competing version of our product after the expiration or loss of our patent and often charge much less. In China, for example, we are expected to face further intensified competition by certain generic manufacturers in 2020, which may result in price cuts and volume loss of some of our products. 

In addition, our patent-protected products can face competition in the form of generic versions of competitors’ branded products that lose their market exclusivity.

As noted above, MCOs that focus primarily on the immediate cost of drugs often favor generics over brand-name drugs. Many governments also encourage the use of generics as alternatives to brand-name drugs in their healthcare programs, including Medicaid in the U.S. Laws in the U.S. generally allow, and in some cases require, pharmacists to substitute, for brand-name drugs, generic drugs that have been rated under government procedures to be chemically and therapeutically equivalent to brand-name drugs. In a small subset of states, prescribing physicians are able to expressly prevent such substitution. Favoring generics may reduce sales of our branded products.

RAW MATERIALS

Raw materials essential to our businesses are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple sources. In 2019, we experienced periodic shortages of select materials due to constrained capacity or operational challenges with the associated suppliers. Supplier management activities are ongoing to work to ensure the necessary supply to meet our requirements for these materials. No significant impact to our operations is anticipated in 2020.

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K13
GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS

Pharmaceutical companies are subject to extensive regulation by government authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain laws and regulations that govern Pfizer’s business are discussed below.

General. Our business has been and will continue to be subject to numerous laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations, including those governing the manufacture and marketing of our products, could subject us to administrative and legal proceedings and actions by various governmental bodies. For additional information on these proceedings and actions, see the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16A. Contingencies and Certain Commitments—Legal Proceedings in our 2019 Financial Report. Criminal charges, substantial fines and/or civil penalties, warning letters and product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, as well as limitations on our ability to conduct business in applicable jurisdictions, could result from such proceedings and actions.

In the United States

Drug Regulation. In the U.S., biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by the FDA, including regulations that govern, among other things, the safety and efficacy of our medicines, clinical trials, advertising and promotion, manufacturing, labeling and record keeping. Our products are also subject to post-market surveillance under the FFDCA and its implementing regulations with respect to drugs, as well as the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations with respect to biologics. 

Other U.S. federal agencies, including the DEA, also regulate certain of our products. Many of our activities also are subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC. 

Biopharmaceutical companies seeking to market a product in the U.S. must first test the product to demonstrate that it is safe and effective for its intended use. If, after evaluation, the FDA determines the product is safe (i.e., its benefits outweigh its known risks) and effective, then the FDA will approve the product for marketing, issuing a New Drug Application or Biologics License Application, as appropriate. Companies seeking to market a generic prescription drug must scientifically demonstrate that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. The Abbreviated New Drug Application, or generic drug application, must show, among other things, that the generic drug is pharmaceutically equivalent to the brand, the manufacturer is capable of making the drug correctly, and the proposed label is the same as that of the innovator/brand drug’s label. 

Even after a drug or biologic is approved for marketing, it may still be subject to postmarketing commitments or postmarketing requirements. Postmarketing commitments are studies or clinical trials that the drug or biologic sponsor has agreed to conduct, but are not required by law and/or regulation. Postmarketing requirements include studies and clinical trials that sponsors are required to conduct, by law and/or regulation, as a condition of approval. Postmarketing studies or clinical trials can be required in order to assess a known risk or demonstrate clinical benefit for drugs or biologics approved pursuant to accelerated approval. If a company fails to meet its postmarketing requirements, the FDA may assess a civil monetary penalty, issue a warning letter or deem the drug or biologic misbranded. Once a drug or biologic is approved, the FDA must be notified of any modifications to the product and the FDA may also require a manufacturer to submit additional studies or conduct clinical trials. In addition, we are also required to report adverse events and comply with cGMPs, as well as advertising and promotion regulations. Failure to comply with the FFDCA may subject us to administrative and/or judicial sanctions, including warning letters, product recalls, seizures, delays in product approvals, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecution.

Biosimilar Regulation. The ACA created a framework for the approval of biosimilars (also known as follow-on biologics) following the expiration of 12 years of exclusivity for the innovator biologic, with a potential six-month pediatric extension. Under the ACA, biosimilar applications may not be submitted until four years after the approval of the reference innovator biologic. 

The FDA is responsible for implementation of the legislation and approval of new biosimilars. Through FDA approvals and the issuance of draft and final guidance, the FDA has addressed a number of issues related to the biosimilars approval pathway, such as the labeling expectations for biosimilars. For example, in 2019, the FDA issued final guidance regarding the standards for demonstrating interchangeability with a U.S.-licensed reference product. In addition, in 2017, the Biosimilar User Fee Act was reauthorized for a five-year period, which led to a significant increase in the FDA’s biosimilar user fee revenues, thereby providing the FDA with additional resources to process biosimilar applications. For example, since the enactment of the newly authorized fee structure, the FDA estimates its revenues from biosimilar user fees generally will exceed $40 million.

Sales and Marketing Laws and Regulations. The marketing practices of U.S. biopharmaceutical companies are generally subject to various federal and state healthcare laws that are intended, among other things, to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and to protect the integrity of government healthcare programs. These laws include anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws generally prohibit a biopharmaceutical company from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying anything of value to generate business, including purchasing or prescribing of a particular product. False claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, any claims for payment for goods (including drugs or biologics) or services to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) that are false or fraudulent and generally treat claims generated through kickbacks as false or fraudulent. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). The federal government 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K14
and various states also have enacted laws to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical companies. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and healthcare providers, require disclosure to the federal or state government and the public of such interactions, and/or require the adoption of compliance standards or programs. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Individual states, acting through their attorneys general, have become active as well, seeking to regulate the marketing of prescription drugs under state consumer protection and false advertising laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalties under the pertinent laws and regulations.

Pricing and Reimbursement. Pricing and reimbursement for our pharmaceutical products depends in part on government regulation. Pfizer must offer discounted pricing or rebates on purchases of pharmaceutical products under various federal and state healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the “federal ceiling price” drug pricing program, the 340B drug pricing program and the Medicare Part D Program. Pfizer must also report specific prices to government agencies under healthcare programs, such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B. The calculations necessary to determine the prices reported are complex and the failure to report prices accurately may expose Pfizer to penalties. See the discussion regarding rebates in the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income—Revenues—Overview section and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1G. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Revenues and Trade Accounts Receivable in our 2019 Financial Report, which are incorporated by reference.

Government and private third-party payers routinely seek to manage utilization and control the costs of our products. Efforts by government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including proposed action on drug importation, could adversely affect our business if implemented. There continues to be considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, and measures to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals are being considered by Congress, the Presidential Administration and select states. For example, recent legislation revised how manufacturers calculate the average manufacturer price on branded drugs with authorized generics under the Medicaid drug rebate program, which the Congressional Budget Office has estimated will reduce Medicaid costs by over $3 billion over the next decade. Proposals for even more far-reaching reform, such as immediately eliminating or phasing out private health insurance, are being proposed by some Democratic candidates for U.S. President. In particular, several states have enacted or are considering transparency laws that require prescription drug manufacturers to report to the state and make public price increases, and sometimes to provide a written justification for the increase. In addition to new state transparency laws and the introduction of several Federal pricing bills, we have also seen the Presidential Administration introduce proposals related to importation and express interest in international reference pricing in Medicare Part B. We expect to see continued focus in regulating pricing resulting in additional legislation and regulation that could adversely impact revenue. In addition, U.S. government action to reduce federal spending on entitlement programs including Medicare and Medicaid may affect payment for our products or services associated with the provision of our products. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—U.S. Entitlement Reform section in this 2019 Form 10-K. Also, the majority of states use preferred drug lists to restrict access to certain pharmaceutical products under Medicaid. Restrictions exist for some Pfizer products under certain state Medicaid programs. As another example, access to our products under the Medicaid managed care program is typically determined by the health plans with which state Medicaid agencies contract to provide services to Medicaid beneficiaries. States continue to explore options for controlling healthcare costs related to Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, including the implementation of supplemental rebate agreements under the Medicaid drug rebate program that are tied to patient outcomes. In addition, we expect that consolidation and integration among pharmacy chains and wholesalers, who collectively are the primary purchasers of our pharmaceutical products in the U.S., and PBMs will increase pricing pressures on pharmaceutical manufacturers, including us. For additional information, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors—Managed Care Trends section in this 2019 Form 10-K. 

The potential for additional pricing and access pressures in the commercial sector continues to be significant. Many employers have adopted high deductible health plans, which can increase out-of-pocket costs for medicines. This is a trend that is likely to continue. Private third-party payers, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharmaceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reimbursement rates and a reduction in demand for our products. Pricing pressures for our products may occur as a result of highly competitive insurance markets. Healthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or implementing more rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.

Overall, there is increasing pressure on U.S. providers to deliver healthcare at a lower cost and to ensure that those expenditures deliver demonstrated value in terms of health outcomes. Longer term, we are seeing a shift in focus away from fee-for-service payments towards outcomes-based payments and risk-sharing arrangements that reward providers for cost reductions and improved patient outcomes. These new payment models can, at times, lead to lower prices for, and restricted access to, new medicines. At the same time, these models can also promote utilization of drugs by encouraging physicians to screen and diagnose and consider drugs as a means of forestalling more costly medical interventions.

We believe medicines are the most efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system. We work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively improve patient health outcomes, lower costs to the healthcare system, and ensure access to medicines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system. In addition, in response to the evolving U.S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we work with health authorities, health technology assessment and quality measurement bodies and major U.S. payers throughout the product-development process to better 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K15
understand how these entities value our compounds and products. Further, we seek to develop stronger internal capabilities focused on demonstrating the value of the medicines that we discover or develop, register and manufacture, by recognizing patterns of usage of our medicines and competitor medicines along with patterns of healthcare costs.

Healthcare Reform. There have been significant efforts at the federal and state levels to reform the healthcare system by enhancing access to healthcare, improving the delivery of healthcare and further rationalizing payment for healthcare. We face uncertainties due to federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. There is additional uncertainty given the ruling in December 2019 by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas v. Azar that the individual mandate, which is a significant provision of the ACA, is unconstitutional. The case has been remanded to a lower court to determine whether the individual mandate is inseparable from the entire ACA, in which case the ACA as a whole would be rendered unconstitutional. In the meantime, the remaining provisions of the law remain in effect. The revenues generated for Pfizer by the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion under the ACA are not material, so the impact of full invalidation of the law is expected to be limited. However, any future replacement for the ACA may adversely affect our business and financial results, particularly if the legislation reduces incentives for employer-sponsored insurance coverage or dramatically increases industry taxes and fees. Any future healthcare reform efforts may adversely affect our business and financial results.

Anti-Corruption. The FCPA prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.

Data Privacy. Pfizer collects personal data as part of its regular business activities. The collection and use of this data is subject to privacy and data security laws and regulations, including oversight by various regulatory or other governmental bodies. For example, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). The CCPA, which came into effect on January 1, 2020, imposes numerous obligations on us, including a duty to disclose the categories of personal data that we collect, sell, or share about California consumers, and gives those consumers rights regarding their personal data. Noncompliance with any of these laws could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop non-compliant activities, and could damage our reputation and harm our business.

Outside the United States 

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most countries outside the U.S. 

New Drug Approvals. In the EU, the approval of new drugs may be achieved using the Mutual Recognition Procedure, the Decentralized Procedure or the EU Centralized Procedure. These procedures apply in the EU member states, plus the European Economic Area countries, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The Centralized Procedure, managed by the EMA, results in one single authorization for the whole EU, which provides the most rapid and efficient means of gaining approval across the EU and is the one most commonly used for new products.

In China, the regulatory system historically presented numerous challenges for the pharmaceutical industry, as its requirements for drug development and registration were often inconsistent with U.S. or other international standards. In recent years, however, China has introduced reforms and draft reforms, which are discussed in more detail below, that attempt to address these challenges. Furthermore, in 2017, the China regulatory authority, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), became a member of the International Council for Harmonization (ICH), which has resulted in greater adoption of international technical guidelines and practices by the government. 2019 was another active year in this respect, with a number of reforms coming into effect, and more proposals and drafts being issued for consultation.

In Japan, the PMDA is the point of entry for businesses looking to sell drugs in the country. The PMDA, which is involved in a wide range of regulatory activities, including clinical studies, approvals, postmarketing reviews and pharmaceuticals safety, must approve an application before a new drug product may be marketed in Japan. The PMDA also offers consultations on clinical trials of new drugs and provides advice on product classifications and approvals.

Health authorities in many middle and lower income countries require marketing approval by a recognized regulatory authority (i.e., similar to the authority of the FDA or the EMA) before they begin to conduct their application review process and/or issue their final approval. Many authorities also require local clinical data in the country’s population in order to receive final marketing approval. 

Pharmacovigilance. In the EU, the EMA’s Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee has the responsibility for reviewing and making recommendations on product safety issues for the EU authorities. EU regulators may require pharmaceutical companies to conduct post-authorization safety and efficacy studies at the time of approval, or at any time afterwards in light of scientific developments. There are also additional extensive requirements regarding adverse drug reaction reporting and additional monitoring of products. Outside developed markets such as the EU and Japan, pharmacovigilance requirements vary and are generally not as extensive, but there is a trend toward increasing regulation.

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K16
Pricing and Reimbursement. Certain governments, including the different EU member states, the U.K., China, Japan, Canada, South Korea and some other international markets, provide healthcare at low-to-zero direct cost to consumers at the point of care and have significant power as large single payers to regulate pharmaceutical prices or patient reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system, particularly under recent global financing pressures. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures for our pharmaceutical products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, “international reference pricing” (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), quality consistency evaluation processes and volume-based procurement. In addition, the international patchwork of price regulation and differing economic conditions and incomplete value assessments across countries has led to varying access to quality medicines in many markets and some third-party trade in our products between countries.

In particular, international reference pricing adds to the regional impact of price cuts in individual countries and hinders patient access and innovation. Price variations, exacerbated by international reference pricing systems, also have resulted from exchange rate fluctuations. The downward pricing pressure resulting from this dynamic can be expected to continue as a result of reforms to international reference pricing policies and measures targeting pharmaceuticals in some European countries.

In addition, several important multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are increasing scrutiny of international pharmaceutical pricing through issuing reports and policy recommendations. In 2019, the WHO continued exerting pressure on pharmaceutical pricing practices by supporting strategies to reduce medicine prices, including calling for greater transparency around the cost of research and development and production of medicines, as well as disclosure of net prices.

In Japan, the pricing environment for innovative medicines further deteriorated in 2019 with the introduction of a health technology assessment (HTA) system to inform price adjustments of healthcare technologies after launch. Expansion of this system for reimbursement decisions, as seen in other HTA markets, remains a risk. While significant challenges remain, the 2020 Drug Pricing Reform Package, unlike the last reform package in 2018, is not expected to fundamentally change the access landscape. Furthermore, the eligibility criteria for the Price Maintenance Premium, a key policy that protects against price erosion for certain products, is expected to be somewhat enhanced while expedited regulatory pathways are codified in law. 

In Canada, the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) released draft guidelines to implement new pricing regulations in November 2019, which will go into force in July 2020. These regulations drop the U.S. from the reference basket of countries used to determine price and add economic factors for setting ceiling prices for new medicines. An initial analysis of the potential impact of these proposed changes to the PMPRB regulations estimated an approximately $26 billion reduction in industry revenues over the next decade.

China Pricing Pressures. In China, healthcare is largely driven by a public payer system, with public medical insurance as the largest single payer for pharmaceuticals, and pricing pressures have increased in recent years. Government officials have consistently emphasized the importance of improved health outcomes, the need for healthcare reform and decreased drug prices as key indicators of progress towards reform. While the government provides basic health insurance for the vast majority of Chinese citizens, that insurance is not adequate to cover many innovative medicines, and alternative funding sources for innovative medicines remain suboptimal.

In 2019, China’s government negotiated with companies to add approximately 90 innovative drugs (mainly oncology medicines) to the National Reimbursement Drug List. This builds on 60 drugs already added through negotiation in 2017 and 2018. Prices for drugs have been reduced dramatically through this government-led process. While these negotiations have included a path to access for companies, market access is not assured. In addition, significant questions about the processes and negotiations for provincial tendering remain, as well as the need for multi-layered negotiations across provincial, municipal and hospital levels.

In the off-patent space, in 2013, China began to implement a quality consistency evaluation (QCE) process in order to improve the quality of domestically-manufactured generic drugs, primarily by requiring such drugs to pass a test to assess their bioequivalence to a qualified reference drug (typically the originator drug). In 2018, numerous local generics were officially deemed bioequivalent under QCE. A pilot project for centralized volume-based procurement (VBP) was then initiated including 25 molecules of drugs covering 11 major Chinese cities. Under this procurement model, a tender process has been established where a certain portion of included molecule volumes are guaranteed to tender winners. The program is intended to contain healthcare costs by driving utilization of generics that have passed QCE, which has resulted in dramatic price cuts for off-patent medicines. 

Upjohn and most off-patent originators were not successful in the first bidding process under this pilot, which was finalized in December 2018 and implemented in March 2019, and most contracts went to local generic companies. The first bidding process resulted in significant price cuts by the successful bidders, with some bidders reducing the price of their products by as much as 96 percent, as companies attempted to secure volumes on the Chinese pharmaceutical market. The drugs that lost the bidding were also requested to reduce their selling price up to 30 percent based on the price difference with the successful bidder. China’s government began nationwide expansion of the VBP pilot in December 2019. The expanded model, which is being implemented nationwide, applies to certain drugs that are purchased for public hospitals as well as some military and private medical institutions. As in the first bidding process, our Upjohn business unit and most originator brands were not successful in 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K17
the bidding process for this nationwide expansion, and those contracts mostly went to local Chinese generic companies. The QCE-qualified generic makers of atorvastatin and amlodipine bid aggressively, lowering prices even further from the March 2019 tender. Our Upjohn business unit continues to take steps to mitigate the revenue impact of these initiatives but anticipates that they will continue to affect our Upjohn business in China in the future. We expect to utilize our presence in the retail channel, private hospitals and tendering capabilities to mitigate some of these pricing pressures. In addition, we believe that our geographic expansion to under-penetrated and lower-tiered cities and counties and additional focus on non-tendered products will increase sales volumes in greater China and partially mitigate pressures from QCE.

In late 2019, China announced another round of expansion of the national VBP program, which covers 33 new molecules, including Biopharma’s Zithromax tablets and Diflucan tablets and no Upjohn products. Biopharma was not successful in the bidding process for this expansion.

Furthermore, the Chinese government has discussed moving toward efforts to unify the reimbursement price between QCE-approved generic medicines and the applicable original medicines. The government currently plans to implement this universal reimbursement price initiative within the next two to three years. If this policy is implemented, the new reimbursement level for Upjohn’s products will likely be lower than the current reimbursement level, placing additional pressures on price and/or patient copays. There remains uncertainty as to whether, when and how this policy may be officially implemented. The Chinese government could also enact other policies that may increase pricing pressures or have the effect of reducing the volume of sales available to Upjohn’s products. This potential policy, and any other policies like it that could increase pricing and copay pressures on Upjohn’s drug products in China, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The government has indicated that additional post-LOE drugs could be subjected to QCE qualification in future rounds, which could also be tied to volume-based procurement. The scope of future QCE products and timing of any program expansion is currently unknown, making it difficult to determine the impact on Pfizer’s business and financial condition. We will continue to monitor the market for developments.

EU Regulatory Changes. The EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation in May 2014, but its implementation has been delayed by the need for the EU authorities to establish new technical systems. This regulation is aimed at simplifying and harmonizing the administrative processes and governance of clinical trials in the EU and will require increased public posting of clinical trial results. It is currently not anticipated to be fully implemented until the first half of 2022 at the earliest.

Brexit. In June 2016, the U.K. electorate voted in a referendum to leave the EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. left the EU on January 31, 2020 with status quo arrangements through a transition period scheduled to end on December 31, 2020. The consequences of the U.K. leaving the EU and the terms of the future trading relationship continue to be highly uncertain, which may pose certain implications to our research, commercial and general business operations in the U.K. and the EU, including the approval and supply of our products. However, both the U.K. and the EU have issued detailed guidance for the industry on how medicines, medical devices and clinical trials will be separately regulated in their respective territories. Pfizer has substantially completed its preparations for Brexit, having made the changes necessary to meet relevant regulatory requirements in the EU and the U.K., through the transition period and afterwards, especially in the regulatory, research, manufacturing and supply chain areas. Between 2018 and 2021, we expect to spend up to approximately $60 million in one-time costs to make these adaptations. For additional information on Brexit, see the Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook—The Global Economic Environment section in our 2019 Financial Report.

China Regulatory Changes. In an effort to encourage drug innovation and reduce backlogs for existing applications for drug approval, in recent years, the NMPA has unveiled numerous reform initiatives for China’s drug approval system and engaged in significant efforts to build its capabilities. The NMPA divides drugs into new drugs and generics, with the definition for new drugs changed from “China New” to “Global New.” This means that drugs previously approved in other markets (such as the U.S. or Europe) are not considered new drugs under China’s regulatory regime. This change in definition creates more opportunities for China’s domestic drug manufacturers than for multinational firms, because multinational firms have historically had significant competitive advantage in successfully achieving regulatory approvals for drugs first approved outside of China. Revisions in 2019 made clear, however, that regulatory approval from the FDA or the EMA would no longer be required for approval of imported drugs, though a notable exception persists for imported vaccines, which still require prior approval from a reference regulatory agency such as the FDA. In 2019, China published a revision to its Drug Administration Law and introduced a “marketing authorization holder” system, which grants the NMPA more authority over regulating manufacturers and provides manufacturers more flexibility in contract manufacturing arrangements and manufacturing site transfers.

While challenges remain, a number of other policy changes are streamlining and accelerating approvals of domestic and imported drugs in China. These reforms, along with China’s June 2018 elevation to the ICH Management Committee, are expected to pave the way for integration of Chinese regulations with global practices. These changes include introducing more streamlined processes for maintaining renewal of product registrations, reduction in importing testing requirements, and establishing an expedited registration pathway for drugs to treat rare diseases and serious, life-threatening illnesses with no effective treatment. Though certain details on implementation are unclear (e.g., evolving list of qualified rare diseases and no guidance on what qualifies as serious, life threatening), the NMPA aims to build expedited pathways for certain categories of products similar to the U.S. and European regulatory systems. Additionally, the NMPA published changes to China’s registration requirements that align more with international practices, including a 60-day review timeline for clinical trial authorizations and 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K18
guidance for acceptance of foreign clinical data and the utilization of real world data in drug development and regulatory decision making.

Although a number of regulatory changes better support China’s inclusion in simultaneous global drug development, unique regulatory requirements continue to pose challenges for multinational companies, including China’s Human Genetic Resources process for exporting clinical trial samples (which adds months to starting a clinical trial in China); mismatched China Pharmacopoeia and manufacturing data requirements that require standards exceeding acceptable practices in the U.S., EU, and Japan; and unpredictable and inconsistent clinical trial inspection practices.

Healthcare Provider Transparency and Disclosures. A number of countries have implemented laws requiring (or their industry associations have recommended) disclosure of transfers of value made by pharmaceutical companies to healthcare providers. For example, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations’ disclosure code requires all members, including Pfizer, to disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals and healthcare organizations. 

Intellectual Property. The World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (WTO-TRIPS) required participant countries to amend their intellectual property laws to provide patent protection for pharmaceutical products by 2005, with an extension until 2033 for least-developed countries. While we still face patent grant, enforcement and other intellectual property challenges around the world, some countries have made improvements. We include stronger patent protection among the factors we consider for continued business expansion in other participant countries. 

While the global intellectual property environment has generally improved following WTO-TRIPS and bilateral/multilateral trade agreements, our future business growth depends on further progress in intellectual property protection. In emerging market countries in particular, governments have used intellectual property policies as a tool to force innovators to accept less than fair value for medicines, as well as to protect their local pharmaceutical industries. Considerable political and economic pressure exists to weaken current intellectual property protection and resist implementation of any further protection, which has led to policies such as more restrictive standards for obtaining patents and more difficult procedures for patenting biopharmaceutical inventions, restrictions on patenting certain types of inventions (e.g., new medical treatment methods), revocation of patents, laws or regulations that promote or provide broad discretion to issue a compulsory license, weak intellectual property enforcement and failure to implement effective regulatory data protection. Our industry advocacy efforts focus on seeking a more balanced business environment for foreign manufacturers, as well as on underscoring the importance of strong intellectual property systems for local innovative industries and helping improve patients’ access to innovative medicines. In developed countries as well, including the EU, we are facing an increasingly challenging intellectual property environment.

As part of the Canada/EU Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement (CETA), Canada now provides sui generis protection, commonly referred to as patent term restoration, for patent term extensions for basic patents; however, the extension is capped at two years, whereas the international norm is five years. In addition, the implementing regulations may create obstacles for patentees applying for patent term restoration via a Certificate of Supplementary Protection (CSP), and Canada’s proposed drug pricing reforms may negatively impact the benefit of a CSP. Furthermore, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will, when implemented, require Canada and Mexico to make certain improvements to their current intellectual property regimes, including the establishment of patent term adjustment for unreasonable delays in the grant of patents.

In China, the intellectual property environment has improved in recent years, although effective enforcement and adequate legal remedies remain areas of concern. The government has taken steps to protect intellectual property rights in conformity with World Trade Organization provisions, although China remained on the U.S. Trade Representative’s Priority Watch List for 2019 due to ongoing enforcement challenges and China’s failure to make certain structural reforms. Further, the standards for patentability in China remain more restrictive than in other major markets, including the U.S., Europe and Japan. Also, while a framework exists for protecting patents for 20 years, enforcement mechanisms are often lacking or inconsistent. For example, the absence of effective patent linkage mechanisms and preliminary injunctions, impractical evidentiary burdens, and heightened sufficiency standards have been used to invalidate patents at the enforcement stage. In 2019, the regulatory authority granted marketing approval to generic products while the reference product in each case are still subject to patent protection, and there is no effective legal means to resolve patent disputes prior to the marketing of those infringing drugs. The U.S. and China recently signed an initial agreement in which China has committed to address some patent-related concerns, and both governments have indicated that they will continue bilateral discussions on implementation of these commitments and other intellectual property issues in 2020.

In Brazil and other Latin American countries, the role of health regulatory authorities in reviewing patents (e.g., National Health Surveillance Agency in Brazil), restrictive patentability rules, ambiguity regarding the term of certain patents and backlogs at patent agencies may limit our ability to protect our products through patents. The lack of regulatory data protection and difficulties in protecting certain types of inventions, such as new medical uses of drug products, may limit the commercial lifespan of some pharmaceutical products. Additionally, an increased threat of issuance of compulsory licenses for biopharmaceutical products exists, which adds to business uncertainty.

In India, we have seen some progress in terms of expediting patent approval processes to reduce pendency rates and implementing training programs to enhance enforcement. Despite these positive steps, gaps remain in terms of addressing longstanding intellectual property concerns. For example, policies favoring compulsory licensing of patents, the tendency of the 

Pfizer Inc.2019 Form 10-K19
Indian Patent Office to revoke pharmaceutical patents in opposition proceedings (both pre- and post-grant), and restrictive standards for patentability of pharmaceutical products have made it difficult to safeguard many of our inventions and our investments in innovation. These policies heighten the risk of additional patent challenges targeting innovative pharmaceutical products, especially in areas perceived as being important to the public health of the population. Challenges against Pfizer patents in India are ongoing.

Data Privacy. Outside of the U.S., many countries where we conduct business, including the EU, have privacy and data security laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal data, and we must comply with these laws and regulations as well. One applicable law is the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR imposes detailed obligations on companies that collect, use, or otherwise process personal data and penalties for noncompliance may include fines of up to 4 percent of the company’s global annual revenue. Additionally, the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving as countries continue to adopt privacy and data security laws. Any inability to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards or other legal obligations regarding data protection or privacy could result in additional costs and liability to Pfizer as well as reputational harm and may adversely affect our business.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

Most of our operations are affected by national, state and/or local environmental laws. We have made, and intend to continue to make, the expenditures necessary for compliance with applicable laws. We also are cleaning up environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. See the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16A3. Contingencies and Certain Commitments—Legal Proceedings––Commercial and Other Matters in our 2019 Financial Report. As a result, we incurred capital and operational expenditures in 2019 for environmental compliance purposes and for the clean-up of certain past industrial activity as follows:

•environment-related capital expenditures— $31 million; and

•other environment-related expenses— $136 million.

While capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not currently anticipate they will have a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position.

Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. For example, in 2017, our manufacturing and commercial operations in Puerto Rico were impacted by hurricanes as our three manufacturing sites in Puerto Rico sustained damage and became inoperable due to issues impacting Puerto Rico overall. All three sites resumed operations, and remediation activities were completed in 2018. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however, we have a program for reviewing our vulnerability to potential weather-related risks and other natural disasters and we update our assessments periodically. To date, we have concluded that, because of our facility locations, our existing distribution networks and our controls, we do not anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on Pfizer in the near term.

EMPLOYEES

In our innovation-intensive business, our employees are vital to our success. We generally believe we have good relationships with our employees. As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 88,300 people in our operations throughout the world.

DISCLOSURE PURSUANT TO SECTION 219 OF THE IRAN THREAT REDUCTION AND SYRIA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT OF 2012

Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (ITRSHRA) requires disclosure by public companies of certain transactions involving the Government of Iran, as well as entities and individuals designated under Executive Order 13382 and Executive Order 13224.
