Overview

ViacomCBS is a leading global media and entertainment company that creates content and experiences for audiences worldwide. 

Merger with Viacom Inc.

On December 4, 2019, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. (“ViacomCBS”).

At the Effective Time, (1) each share of Viacom Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, and (2) each share of Viacom Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into 0.59625 shares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock (together with ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock, the “ViacomCBS Common Stock”). At the Effective Time, each share of CBS Class A Common Stock and each share of CBS Class B Common Stock (together with CBS Class A Common Stock, the “CBS Common Stock”) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, remained an issued and outstanding share of ViacomCBS Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock, respectively, and was not affected by the Merger. 

Following the Merger, the CBS Common Stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and the Viacom Common Stock ceased trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”). On December 5, 2019, ViacomCBS

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Class A Common Stock and ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock were listed on Nasdaq and began trading under the ticker symbols VIACA and VIAC, respectively.

The Merger is being accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom (and remains the controlling stockholder of ViacomCBS). The net assets of Viacom have been combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented. 

Operational Highlights 2019 vs. 2018 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) See pages II-6 - II-8 and II-33 for reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).

For 2019, revenues increased 2% to $27.81 billion from $27.25 billion in 2018, driven by CBS’ broadcast of Super Bowl LIII in 2019, growth from our streaming services, which include CBS All Access, Pluto TV and the Showtime streaming subscription offering (“Showtime OTT”), and higher content licensing revenues driven by the production of programming for third parties. These increases were partially offset by lower theatrical revenues, primarily due to the difficult comparison against Mission: Impossible - Fallout in 2018, and lower political advertising sales as a result of the midterm elections in 2018. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on the revenue comparison. 

Operating income decreased 18% to $4.27 billion from $5.20 billion in 2018. This comparison was impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including restructuring charges, costs related to the Merger and other corporate matters, programming charges and gains on the sale of assets. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”) decreased 12%, primarily reflecting an increased investment in content, including a higher number of series produced for exhibition on our properties as well as for third parties. Net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS for 2019 were $3.27 billion, or $5.30 per diluted share, compared with $3.42 billion, or $5.51 per diluted share, for 2018. This comparison was impacted by the aforementioned items as well as other items identified as affecting comparability set forth in the section “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures” below. Adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS decreased 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) from continuing operations decreased 15% to $5.01 for 2019, driven by the lower Adjusted OIBDA. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations are non-GAAP financial measures. See pages II-6

- II-8 for details of the items excluded from financial results, and reconciliations of adjusted results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP. 

We generated operating cash flow of $1.23 billion in 2019 compared with $3.46 billion in 2018. Free cash flow was $877 million for 2019 compared with $3.11 billion for 2018. These decreases primarily reflected the aforementioned increased investment in content, higher payments for income taxes and payments of $132 million in 2019 for costs related to the Merger. In addition, operating cash flow and free cash flow included payments for restructuring activities of $234 million in 2019 and $219 million in 2018. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Free Cash Flow” on pages II-33 for a reconciliation of net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with GAAP, to free cash flow.

Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures

Results for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results. 

Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, benefit (provision) for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. 

The following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

Consolidated Results of Operations—2019 vs. 2018 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

Advertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on the CBS Television Network, our basic cable networks and our television stations, as well as on our ad-supported streaming services, including CBS All Access and Pluto TV, and on our websites. Our advertising revenues include integrated marketing services, which provide unique branded content and custom sponsorship opportunities to our advertisers, as well as advanced marketing solutions (“AMS”), including addressable video and brand solutions. For 2019, the 2% increase in advertising revenues was driven by 5% growth in domestic advertising revenues, reflecting CBS’ broadcast of tent-pole sporting events in 2019, mainly Super Bowl LIII and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament (“NCAA Tournament”), as well as higher revenues from AMS, which includes Pluto TV. These increases were partially offset by lower political advertising sales at our owned television stations, as a result of the benefit to last year from the 2018 midterm elections. International advertising revenues decreased 14%, reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, as well as softness in the Australian and UK markets, partially offset by increases in pricing and political advertising in Argentina. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the total advertising revenues comparison and 9-percentage points on the international advertising revenues comparison.

The Super Bowl is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through the 2022 season under the current contract with the National Football League (“NFL”), and the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreement with the NCAA and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”). In 2020, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively affected by the benefit in 2019 from CBS’ broadcasts of the Super Bowl and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament. These events will not be broadcast by CBS in 2020. Advertising revenues in 2020 will benefit from higher political advertising sales, mainly in the second half of the year, associated with the U.S. Presidential election. 

Affiliate 

Affiliate revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and virtual MVPDs for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“station affiliation fees”); fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and virtual MVPDs’ carriage of our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”); and subscription fees for our streaming services. For 2019, the 3% increase in affiliate revenues reflects 20% growth in station affiliation fees and retransmission fees, driven by annual contractual increases and contract renewals with MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, as well as 45% growth from our streaming services, including CBS All Access and Showtime OTT, driven by subscriber growth. These increases were partially offset by 5% lower cable affiliate fees, mainly resulting from subscriber declines. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 4%, while international affiliate revenues decreased 6% from the prior 

II-9

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

year driven by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the total affiliate revenues comparison and 6-percentage points on the international affiliate revenues comparison.

Content Licensing

Content licensing revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of exhibition rights for our internally-produced television and film programming to television stations, cable networks, and subscription video-on-demand (“SVOD”) and free video-on-demand services; home entertainment revenues, which are derived from the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners, as well as from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (“TVOD”) and electronic sell-through services; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; and fees from the distribution of third-party programming. For 2019, content licensing revenues increased 5%, primarily reflecting higher revenues from the domestic licensing of our content, driven by the production of programming for third parties and the licensing of programming to SVOD providers. These increases were partially offset by a decline in international licensing revenues.

Revenues from the licensing of exhibition rights are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, and therefore, content licensing revenue comparisons are impacted by fluctuations resulting from the timing of the availability of our programming for multiyear licensing agreements.

Theatrical

Theatrical revenues are principally comprised of the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For 2019, theatrical revenues decreased 26%, principally reflecting a difficult comparison against the prior year, as a result of the 2018 releases of Mission: Impossible - Fallout and A Quiet Place. Theatrical revenues in 2019 benefited from the releases of Rocketman, Gemini Man and Dora and the Lost City of Gold, as well as the continued success of the 2018 release, Bumblebee. Domestic theatrical revenues decreased 31% and international theatrical revenues decreased 23%. 

Theatrical revenues may be affected by many factors, including domestic and international audience response, the number, timing and mix of releases and competitive offerings in any given period, consumer tastes and consumption habits and overall economic conditions, including discretionary spending. Revenues from theatrical film releases tend to be cyclical with increases during the summer.

Publishing

Publishing revenues are principally comprised of the domestic and international publishing and distribution of consumer books in printed, digital and audio formats. For 2019, publishing revenues decreased 1%, driven by lower print book sales, which were partially offset by higher sales from digital audio books.

Other 

Other revenues are principally comprised of revenues from the rental of production facilities and digital revenues from search and e-commerce partners. For 2019, other revenues decreased 3%, mainly reflecting lower revenues from the rental of our production facilities as a result of the sale of CBS Television City in January 2019.

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

n/m - not meaningful

 Production

Production expenses reflect the amortization of direct costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content as well as other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2019, the 5% increase in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a higher number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, including our streaming services and cable networks, as well as higher amortization of television production costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of feature film costs, driven by costs in 2018 associated with Mission: Impossible - Fallout.

Programming

Programming expenses reflect the amortization of acquired programs exhibited on our television broadcast networks, cable networks and television stations. For 2019, the 8% increase in programming expenses was driven by higher sports programming costs, mainly from CBS’ broadcasts of Super Bowl LIII and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament in 2019, which were not broadcast by CBS in 2018, and programming for Pluto TV, which we acquired in March 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower amortization of acquired programming for our cable networks.

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

Participation, distribution and royalty costs primarily include participation and residual expenses for television and film programming, royalty costs for publishing content and other distribution expenses incurred with respect to film and television content, such as print and advertising. For 2019, the 2% increase in participation, distribution and royalty costs was driven by higher participation costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues.

Programming Charges

During 2019, in connection with the Merger, we implemented management changes across the organization. In connection with these changes, we performed an evaluation of our programming portfolio across all of our businesses, including an assessment of the optimal use of our programming in the marketplace, which resulted in the identification of programs not aligned with management’s strategy. As a result, we recorded programming charges of $589 million principally reflecting accelerated amortization associated with changes in the expected monetization of certain programs, and decisions to cease airing, alter future airing patterns or not renew certain programs. 

In addition, during 2018, in connection with management changes, we recorded programming charges of $162 million relating to changes to our programming strategy, including at CBS Films, which shifted its focus from theatrical films to developing content for our streaming services, as well as at our Cable Networks segment where we ceased the use of certain programming.

II-11

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Other

Other operating expenses primarily include compensation and costs associated with book sales, including printing and warehousing. For 2019, the 8% increase in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth and expansion of our streaming services. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy, professional service fees and back office support, including employee compensation. The 8% increase in SG&A expenses was driven by higher advertising and marketing costs, reflecting an increase in the number of series premieres and costs associated with our streaming services, as well as the inclusion of Pluto TV and Pop TV since their acquisitions in the first quarter of 2019. These increases were partially offset by cost savings associated with restructuring activities and compensation cost savings resulting from changes in senior management at CBS in 2018. 

Depreciation and Amortization

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including amortization of transponders and equipment under finance leases, and amortization of finite-lived intangible assets. For 2019, depreciation and amortization expense also includes an impairment charge of $20 million to reduce the carrying value of broadcast licenses in Australia to their fair value. 

Restructuring and Other Corporate Matters 

During 2019 and 2018, we recorded costs for restructuring and other corporate matters as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $424 million, primarily for severance and the acceleration of stock-based compensation in connection with the Merger, as well as costs related to a restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2019 under which severance payments are being provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elected to participate. In addition, in 2019 we incurred costs of $294 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, transaction-related bonuses, and contractual executive compensation, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, that was triggered by the Merger. We also incurred costs of $40 million in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute and $17 million associated with legal proceedings involving the Company (see Note 19) and other corporate matters.

II-12

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded restructuring charges of $310 million resulting from cost transformation initiatives to improve margins, as well as restructuring-related costs of $52 million, comprised of third-party professional services associated with such initiatives. In addition, in 2018 we recorded expenses of $128 million primarily for professional fees related to legal proceedings, investigations at our Company and the evaluation of potential merger activity. 

Gain on Sale of Assets

In 2019, we completed the sale of CBS Television City for $750 million. We have guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. Included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 is a liability of $124 million, reflecting the present value of the estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation. This transaction resulted in a gain of $549 million for 2019, which includes a reduction for the guarantee obligation. We also recognized a tax benefit of $140 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the reversal of a valuation allowance relating to capital loss carryforwards that were utilized in connection with this sale.

Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes

The benefit (provision) for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2019, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of $9 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of (0.3)%, which included discrete items such as a deferred tax benefit of $768 million resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations; tax benefits of $44 million realized in connection with the preparation of the 2018 federal tax return, based on further clarity provided by the United States government on tax positions relating to the Tax Reform Act; and a tax benefit of $39 million triggered by the bankruptcy of an investee. For 2018, the provision for income taxes was $617 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 15.0%. The provision for income taxes for 2018 included discrete items such as the reversal of a valuation allowance of $140 million relating to capital loss carryforwards that were utilized in connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019; a tax benefit of $80 million relating to the Tax Reform Act and other tax law changes; and a net tax benefit of $71 million relating to a tax accounting method change granted by the Internal Revenue Service.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Consolidated Results of Operations— 2018 vs. 2017 

Revenues

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Advertising

For 2018, the 2% increase in advertising revenues was driven by our acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017; record political advertising sales in 2018 associated with the U.S. midterm elections; higher pricing at our broadcast and cable networks; and growth in revenues from AMS. Advertising revenues for 2018 also benefited from the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2018, under which revenues for certain distribution arrangements are recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. This guidance was applied prospectively from the date of adoption, and therefore, amounts for 2017 are reported under previous accounting guidance. These increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions at our cable networks and the absence of the broadcasts of five Thursday Night Football games and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. The national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast by the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreements with the NCAA and Turner. Foreign exchange rate changes had an unfavorable impact of 1-percentage point on the advertising revenues comparison. 

Affiliate 

For 2018, the 3% increase in affiliate revenues reflects 22% growth in station affiliation and retransmission fees and 65% growth from subscription fees for our streaming services, CBS All Access and Showtime OTT. These increases were partially offset by the unfavorable comparison against Showtime Networks’ distribution in 2017 of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event. Cable affiliate fees were relatively flat for 2018 compared with 2017, as contractual rate increases under carriage agreements for our cable networks and the benefit of new channel launches and acquisitions were offset by subscriber declines.

Content Licensing

For 2018, the 4% increase in content licensing revenues reflects higher revenues from the distribution of third-party content, resulting from revenues under certain distribution arrangements now being recognized at the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting increase to participation expense, as a result of the adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in the first quarter of 2018. Under previous guidance, such 

II-14

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

distribution revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. The increase also reflected growth from domestic and international license fees, including the 2018 availability of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, The Haunting of Hill House, Maniac, The Alienist and The Cloverfield Paradox, compared with 2017, which included the licensing of NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and titles from the CSI franchise. These increases were partially offset by lower home entertainment revenues, primarily reflecting the number and mix of titles in release.

Theatrical

For 2018, theatrical revenues increased 4%, principally reflecting the strong performance of the theatrical release of Mission: Impossible - Fallout in 2018. 

Publishing

Publishing revenues for 2018 decreased 1% driven by lower sales of print and electronic books, which were partially offset by higher sales of digital audio books. 

Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Production

For 2018, the 8% increase in production expenses reflected an increased investment in content, including a higher number of series produced for distribution on multiple platforms, including our owned networks and streaming services, and the acquisition of Network 10 in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Programming

For 2018, the 7% decrease in programming expenses was driven by lower sports programming costs, resulting from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event in 2017 and the absence of Thursday Night Football and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament, which were broadcast on the CBS Television Network in 2017. These decreases were partially offset by costs for programming on Network 10, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017, and an increased investment in programming for our cable networks. 

Participation, Distribution and Royalty

For 2018, the 4% increase in participation, distribution and royalty costs was primarily driven by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of 2018, which resulted in revenues under certain distribution arrangements being recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer, with an offsetting participation expense recognized for the fees paid to the third party. Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. This 

II-15

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

change resulted in an increase to both revenues and participation expenses of $279 million for 2018, with no impact to our operating income. The increase also reflects higher participation costs associated with the increase in content licensing revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower film distribution costs, driven by the number and mix of theatrical releases and a charge in 2017 resulting from the termination of a slate financing agreement. 

Programming Charges

During 2018, in connection with management changes, we recorded programming charges of $162 million relating to changes to our programming strategy, including at CBS Films, which shifted its focus from theatrical films to developing content for our streaming services, as well as at our Cable Networks segment where we ceased the use of certain programming.

In addition, during 2017, we recorded programming charges of $144 million associated with management’s decision to cease use of certain original and acquired programming, in connection with the execution of a strategy for certain of our flagship brands and strategic initiatives at Paramount.

For 2018, the 6% increase in other operating expenses mainly reflected higher costs associated with growth in our streaming services and expenses of Network 10, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

party professional services associated with such initiatives. In addition, in 2018 we recorded expenses of $128 million primarily for professional fees related to legal proceedings, investigations at our Company and the evaluation of potential merger activity. 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded restructuring charges of $258 million, resulting from the execution of a strategy for certain of our flagship brands and strategic initiatives at Paramount, as well as costs relating to other restructuring plans across several of our businesses in a continued effort to reduce our cost structure. The restructuring charges for 2017 included a non-cash impairment charge resulting from the decision to abandon an international trade name in connection with the strategic initiatives. 

Gain on Sale of Assets

In 2017, we completed the sale of broadcast spectrum in connection with the FCC’s broadcast spectrum auction. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $127 million on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, with $11 million attributable to the noncontrolling interest. In addition, in 2017 we recorded a net gain of $19 million relating to the disposition of property and equipment.

During 2018, we recorded a loss on marketable securities of $23 million. In connection with the adoption of FASB guidance on financial instruments, beginning in the first quarter of 2018, changes in the fair value of marketable securities are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt

For 2018, the gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18 million reflected the pre-tax gain associated with the redemption of senior notes and debentures prior to maturity totaling $1.13 billion. During 2017, we redeemed, prior to maturity, senior notes totaling $4.27 billion, resulting in the recognition of a pre-tax loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $38 million. 

Gain on Sale of EPIX

During 2017, we completed the sale of our 49.76% interest in EPIX, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $285 million.

Pension Settlement Charge

During 2017, we purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company permanently assumed our obligation to pay and administer pension benefits to certain pension plan participants, or their designated beneficiaries, who had been receiving pension benefits. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, our outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately $800 million. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a settlement charge of $352 million in 2017, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Additionally, during 2017, we made discretionary contributions totaling $600 million to prefund our qualified pension plans.

Net Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For 2018, the 5% increase in net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS was driven by the lower effective income tax rate in 2018, partially offset by lower operating income. Diluted EPS from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS grew 9%, reflecting the higher earnings and lower weighted average shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases and the shares retired as a result of the split-off of CBS Radio Inc. (“CBS Radio) during the fourth quarter of 2017. 

Net Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

On November 16, 2017, we completed the split-off of CBS Radio through an exchange offer, in which we accepted 17.9 million shares of CBS Class B Common Stock from our stockholders in exchange for the 101.4 million shares of CBS Radio common stock that we owned. Immediately following the exchange offer, each share of CBS Radio common stock was converted into one share of Entercom Communications Corp. (“Entercom”) Class A common stock upon completion of the merger of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS Radio has been presented as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.

Segments

We operate in the following four segments:

TV ENTERTAINMENT: Our TV Entertainment segment creates and acquires programming for distribution and viewing on multiple media platforms, including our broadcast network, through multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and virtual MVPDs, and our streaming services, as well as for licensing to third parties both domestically and internationally. TV Entertainment consists of the CBS Television Network, CBS Television Studios, CBS Television Distribution, CBS Interactive, CBS Sports Network, CBS Television Stations and CBS-branded streaming services CBS All Access and CBSN, among others. TV Entertainment’s revenues are generated primarily from advertising sales, the licensing and distribution of its content, and affiliate revenues. 

CABLE NETWORKS: Our Cable Networks segment creates and acquires programming for distribution and viewing on multiple media platforms, including our cable networks, through MVPDs and virtual MVPDs, and our streaming services, as well as for licensing to third parties both domestically and internationally. Cable Networks consists of our premium subscription cable networks Showtime, The Movie Channel and Flix, and a subscription streaming offering of Showtime; our basic cable networks Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, Nick Jr., VH1, TV Land, CMT, Pop TV and Smithsonian Channel, among others, as well as the international extensions of these brands operated by ViacomCBS Networks International; international broadcast networks, Network 10, Channel 5 and Telefe; and Pluto TV, a leading free streaming TV platform in the United States. Cable Networks’ revenues are generated primarily from affiliate revenues, advertising sales and the licensing of its content and brands. 

FILMED ENTERTAINMENT: Our Filmed Entertainment segment develops, produces, finances, acquires and distributes films, television programming and other entertainment content in various markets and media worldwide primarily through Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation and Paramount Television Studios. Filmed Entertainment’s revenues are generated primarily from the release and/or distribution of films theatrically, the release and/or distribution of film and television product through home entertainment, the licensing of film and television product to television and digital platforms and other ancillary activities. 

PUBLISHING: Our Publishing segment publishes and distributes Simon & Schuster consumer books domestically and internationally and includes imprints such as Simon & Schuster, Scribner, Atria Books and Gallery Books. Publishing generates revenues from the publishing and distribution of consumer books in print, digital and audio formats. 

We present operating income (loss) excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and gain on sale of assets, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting. We began presenting Adjusted OIBDA as our segment profit measure in the fourth quarter of 2019 in order to align with the primary method used by our management beginning after the Merger to evaluate segment performance and to make decisions regarding the allocation of resources to our segments. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. The reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to our consolidated net earnings is presented in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements.

Revenues

For 2019, the 8% increase in TV Entertainment revenues reflects growth across each of the segment’s main revenue streams.

Advertising

The 4% increase in advertising revenues was driven by 11% growth in CBS Network advertising, principally reflecting CBS’ broadcasts of Super Bowl LIII and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament, partially offset by the timing of other sporting events. Taken together these items contributed 9-percentage points of the growth in network advertising. Advertising sales at our owned television stations decreased 11%, primarily reflecting record political advertising in 2018 from the midterm elections, partially offset by the benefit from CBS’ broadcast of Super Bowl LIII. The Super Bowl is broadcast on the CBS Television Network on a rotating basis with other networks through the 2022 season under the current contract with the NFL and the national semifinals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament are broadcast on the CBS Television Network every other year through 2032 under the current agreement with the NCAA and Turner.

Affiliate 

Affiliate revenues grew 22%, primarily as a result of a 20% increase in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues as well as subscriber growth at CBS All Access.

Content Licensing

Content licensing increased 5%, driven by higher revenues from the production of programming for third parties, including Unbelievable and Dead to Me, and higher revenues from the licensing of library programming to SVOD providers. 

Adjusted OIBDA

Adjusted OIBDA decreased 1% as a result of an increased investment in content and higher costs associated with the growth and expansion of our streaming services, partially offset by higher revenues.

Comparability in 2020 will be negatively affected by the benefit in 2019 from CBS’ broadcasts of Super Bowl LIII and the national semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Tournament. Results in 2020 will benefit from higher political advertising revenues, mainly in the second half of the year, associated with the U.S. Presidential election.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

For 2019, Cable Networks revenues decreased 2% from the prior year, reflecting an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate changes of 2-percentage points. Domestic revenues remained substantially flat compared with the prior year as higher advertising revenues were offset by a decline in affiliate revenues. International revenues decreased 9% mainly as a result of a 7-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.

Advertising

Advertising revenues remained flat compared with the prior year and included an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 3-percentage points. Domestic advertising revenues increased 6%, reflecting higher revenues from AMS, which comprised approximately 19% of domestic advertising revenues in 2019, and includes Pluto TV, which was acquired in March 2019. The domestic advertising growth also reflects higher pricing and the inclusion of the results of Pop TV. We began consolidating Pop TV in March 2019 when we acquired the 50% stake we did not own, which brought our ownership to 100%. These increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions. International advertising revenues decreased 13%, mainly reflecting the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 9-percentage points, as well as softness in the Australian and UK markets, partially offset by increases in pricing and political advertising in Argentina.

Affiliate 

Affiliate revenues decreased 4%, which included a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rate changes. Domestic affiliate revenues decreased 4%, primarily driven by declines in traditional MVPD subscribers at our basic and premium cable networks. These declines were partially offset by growth from Showtime OTT, the inclusion of the results of Pop TV, and contractual rate increases under carriage agreements. International affiliate revenues decreased 6%, reflecting a 6-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes. As of December 31, 2019, Showtime subscriptions, including Showtime OTT, totaled approximately 27 million.

Content Licensing

The 1% increase in content licensing revenues, which includes the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes of 1-percentage point, was the result of increased revenues from the production of programming for third parties, including The Real World and Bellator mixed martial arts events. These increases were partially offset by lower secondary market revenue, driven by the renewal of a significant domestic licensing agreement for the Showtime original series, Dexter, in 2018.

Revenues

For 2019, the 1% increase in Filmed Entertainment revenues reflects growth in licensing revenues, partially offset by lower theatrical revenues. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on the revenue comparison. 

Theatrical

The 26% decrease in theatrical revenues principally reflects a difficult comparison to the prior year, as a result of the 2018 releases of Mission: Impossible - Fallout and A Quiet Place. Theatrical revenues in 2019 benefited from the releases of Rocketman, Gemini Man and Dora and the Lost City of Gold, as well as the continued success of the 2018 release, Bumblebee. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on theatrical revenues. 

Home Entertainment

The 1% increase in home entertainment revenues was driven by the number and mix of titles in release. Significant 2019 releases included Bumblebee, Rocketman, Instant Family, and Pet Sematary, while 2018 benefited from the releases of Mission: Impossible - Fallout, Daddy’s Home 2 and A Quiet Place. Changes in foreign exchange rates resulted in a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on the revenue comparison. 

Licensing

The 14% growth in licensing revenues was driven by increases in licensing of film catalog titles to SVOD providers and recent releases to pay television services. Foreign exchange rate changes had a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact on licensing revenues. 

Other

The 9% increase in other revenues was driven by higher studio rental revenues.

Adjusted OIBDA

Adjusted OIBDA for 2019 increased to $80 million from a loss of $33 million for 2018, principally driven by higher profits from licensing of film library titles. This increase was partially offset by costs associated with future film releases and higher incentive compensation costs. Fluctuations in results for the Filmed Entertainment segment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of print and advertising expenses, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and subsequent distribution windows.

Publishing (Simon & Schuster)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Revenues

For 2019, the 1% decrease in revenues primarily reflects lower print book sales, partially offset by 15% growth in digital audio sales. Bestselling titles for 2019 included Howard Stern Comes Again by Howard Stern, The Institute by Stephen King and The Pioneers by David McCullough.

Adjusted OIBDA

The 7% decrease in Adjusted OIBDA primarily reflects lower revenues and higher costs from the mix of titles.

Under previous accounting guidance, such revenues were recognized at the net amount retained by us after the payment of fees to the third party. This guidance was applied prospectively from the date of adoption and therefore, amounts for 2017 are reported under previous accounting guidance. 

Affiliate 

Affiliate revenues grew 24% as a result of a 22% increase in station affiliation fees and retransmission revenues as well as subscriber growth at CBS All Access.

Content Licensing

Content licensing increased 4%, primarily reflecting higher international licensing and the impact of the aforementioned adoption of a new revenue recognition standard in 2018, which resulted in higher revenues under certain distribution arrangements, with an offsetting increase to operating expenses. These increases were partially offset by lower domestic licensing, as 2017 included the licensing of NCIS: New Orleans, Madam Secretary and titles from the CSI franchise. 

Adjusted OIBDA

Adjusted OIBDA increased 7% as a result of higher revenues and lower programming costs associated with the absence of CBS’s broadcast of Thursday Night Football, partially offset by an increased investment in content and digital initiatives.

The 3% decrease in affiliate revenues was the result of a 4% decrease in domestic revenues, reflecting the benefit to 2017 from Showtime Networks’ distribution of the Floyd Mayweather/Conor McGregor pay-per-view boxing event and declines in traditional MVPD subscribers at our basic cable networks. Growth from Showtime OTT and contractual rate increases partially offset the decline. As of December 31, 2018, Showtime subscriptions, including Showtime OTT, totaled approximately 27 million. International affiliate revenues increased 6%, driven by the acquisition of Network 10, as well as subscriber growth and new channel launches. International affiliate revenues included a 1-percentage point unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Operating Activities. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by an increased investment in television and film programming, higher payments for income taxes and payments of $132 million associated with costs related to the Merger. Operating cash flow for 2019 and 2018 also included payments for restructuring activities of $234 million and $219 million, respectively.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for 2018 compared with 2017 was primarily driven by lower cash payments for income taxes and growth in affiliate revenues, which were partially offset by an increased investment in television and film programming. Operating cash flow for 2017 also included discretionary pension contributions of $600 million to prefund our qualified pension plans. 

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations primarily reflected the operating activities of CBS Radio. Operating activities from discontinued operations also included payments and refunds for tax matters in foreign jurisdictions related to previously disposed businesses that are accounted for as discontinued operations. 

The increase in cash payments for income taxes for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to a payment in 2019 as a result of guidance issued by the United States government in January 2019 relating to the transition tax on cumulative foreign earnings and profits that resulted from the enactment of federal tax legislation in December 2017. In addition, cash taxes for 2018 benefited from the application of a federal income tax overpayment carryforward from 2017. 

The decrease in cash payments for income taxes for 2018 compared to 2017 reflects the benefit from a federal income tax overpayment, which included the impact from the retroactive renewal of a federal tax law. 

Investing Activities

Financing Activities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow reflects our net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities before operating cash flow from discontinued operations, and less capital expenditures. Our calculation of free cash flow includes capital expenditures because investment in capital expenditures is a use of cash that is directly related to our operations. Our net cash flow provided by (used for) operating activities is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

Management believes free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available to us to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments, maintain our capital assets, satisfy our tax obligations, and fund ongoing operations and working capital needs. As a result, free cash flow is a significant measure of our ability to generate long-term value. It is useful for investors to know whether this ability is being enhanced or degraded as a result of our operating performance. We believe the presentation of free cash flow is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. Free cash flow is among several components of incentive compensation targets for certain management personnel. In addition, free cash flow is a primary measure used externally by our investors, analysts and industry peers for purposes of valuation and comparison of our operating performance to other companies in our industry.

As free cash flow is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, free cash flow should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, either net cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity or net earnings (loss) as a measure of operating performance. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, free cash flow as a measure of liquidity has certain limitations, does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of our net cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow.

During December 2019, we repurchased 1.2 million shares of ViacomCBS Class B Common Stock under our share repurchase program for $50 million, at an average cost of $40.78 per share. At December 31, 2019, $2.41 billion of authorization remained under the share repurchase program. 

Capital Structure

The following table sets forth our debt.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued $500 million of 4.20% senior notes due 2029. We used the net proceeds from this issuance in the redemption of our $600 million outstanding 2.30% senior notes due August 2019. During 2019, we also repaid the $220 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.625% senior notes due September 2019 and the $90 million aggregate principal amount of our 2.75% senior notes due December 2019. 

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we redeemed $1.13 billion of senior notes and debentures for a redemption price of $1.10 billion, resulting in a pre-tax gain on early extinguishment of debt of $18 million ($14 million, net of tax). 

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we issued $3.10 billion of senior notes and junior subordinated debentures. Also during 2017, we redeemed and repaid $4.67 billion of senior notes, of which $4.27 billion was

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

redeemed prior to maturity, resulting in a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $38 million ($21 million, net of tax). 

Our 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.895% and 3.899%, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period. 

The subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.

The interest rate payable on our 2.25% senior notes due February 2022 and 3.45% senior notes due October 2026, collectively the “Senior Notes”, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to the Senior Notes. The interest rate on these Senior Notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding principal amount of our 2.25% senior notes due February 2022 and 3.45% senior notes due October 2026 was $50 million and $124 million, respectively.

Some of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.

We had outstanding commercial paper borrowings under our $2.50 billion commercial paper program of $699 million and $674 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, each with maturities of less than 90 days. The weighted average interest rate for these borrowings was 2.07% and 3.02% at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

In January 2020, our commercial paper program was increased to $3.50 billion in conjunction with the new $3.50 billion revolving credit facility described below.

Credit Facility 

At December 31, 2019, we had a $2.50 billion revolving credit facility held by CBS prior to the Merger (the “CBS Credit Facility”) with a maturity in June 2021 and a $2.50 billion revolving credit facility held by Viacom prior to the Merger (the “Viacom Credit Facility”), with a maturity in February 2024. At December 31, 2019, we had no borrowings outstanding under the CBS Credit Facility or the Viacom Credit Facility and the remaining availability, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $2.50 billion for each facility. 

In January 2020, the CBS Credit Facility was terminated and the Viacom Credit Facility was amended and restated to a $3.50 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper outstanding, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at our option at the time of each borrowing and are based generally on the prime rate in the U.S. or LIBOR plus a margin based on our senior unsecured debt rating. The Credit Facility requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive

quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter, to be applied retrospectively from December 31, 2019. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met this covenant as of December 31, 2019. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows generated from operating activities available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, commitments for sports programming rights, television and film programming, talent contracts, leases, interest payments, income taxes payments and pension funding obligations. Our investing and financing spending includes capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. 

We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under the $3.50 billion Credit Facility, and access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months. 

Our funding for short-term and long-term obligations will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to lower our interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.

Funding for our long-term debt obligations due over the next five years of $5.90 billion is expected to come from our ability to refinance our debt and cash generated from operating activities.

Our access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. The cost of any new borrowings are affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.

At December 31, 2019, we had $2.41 billion of remaining availability under our share repurchase program. Share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.

Contractual Obligations 

As of December 31, 2019, payments due by period under our significant contractual obligations with remaining terms in excess of one year were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Our programming and talent commitments include $5.39 billion for sports programming rights, $3.80 billion relating to the production and licensing of television and film programming, and $1.17 billion for talent contracts.

(b) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including open purchase orders.

(c) Consists of operating lease commitments for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities.

(d) Long-term debt obligations are presented at face value, excluding finance leases.

(e) Future interest based on scheduled debt maturities. Interest payments on junior subordinated debentures subsequent to the expiration of their fixed-rate periods have been included based on their current fixed rates.

(f) Includes finance lease obligations for satellite transponders and equipment.

(g) Reflects long-term contractual obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, including program liabilities; participations due to producers; residuals; and a tax liability resulting from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act in December 2017. This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on our historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.

The table above does not include payments relating to reserves for uncertain tax positions of $384 million, and related interest and penalties, interest under our credit facility and for commercial paper borrowings, redeemable noncontrolling interest of $254 million, our guarantee liability of $124 million relating to the sale of CBS Television City; lease indemnification obligations of $86 million or potential future contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. The amount and timing of payments with respect to these items are subject to a number of uncertainties such that we are unable to make sufficiently reliable estimations of future payments.

In 2020, we expect to make contributions of approximately $70 million to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy the benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $43 million to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans. 

Guarantees

Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds. We have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2019, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $136 million and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

II-36

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

CBS Television City. During 2019, we completed the sale of CBS Television City. We have guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first five years following the completion of the sale. Included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019 is a liability of $124 million, reflecting the present value of the estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.

Lease Guarantees. As noted above, we have indemnification obligations of $86 million with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc. 

Film Financing Arrangements. From time to time we enter into film or television programming (collectively referred to as “film”) financing arrangements that involve the sale of a partial copyright interest in a film to third-party investors. Since the investors typically have the risks and rewards of ownership proportionate to their ownership in the film, we generally record the amounts received for the sale of copyright interest as a reduction of the cost of the film and related cash flows are reflected in net cash flow from operating activities. We also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute films (“co-financing arrangements”), under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the film in specific territories or distribution windows. The partners’ share in the profits and losses of the films under these arrangements are included within participations expense.

In the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for its indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates, which are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.

We consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales and content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.

II-37

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

Advertising Revenues—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.

Content Licensing Revenues—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. 

Affiliate Revenues—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and subscribers to our digital streaming services, also includes a license to programming for video on demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to our customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.

Film and Television Production Costs

Costs incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film based on the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”). Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the amortization of capitalized production costs, expensing of participation costs, and any necessary impairments to capitalized production costs. 

For television programming, our estimates of Ultimate Revenue are initially limited to the amount of revenue contracted for each episode in the initial market and estimates of revenue from a secondary market where we can demonstrate a history of earning such revenue in that market. Estimates for additional secondary market revenues such as domestic and foreign syndication and home entertainment are included in the estimates of Ultimate Revenues once it can be demonstrated that a program can be successfully licensed in such secondary market. For each television program, management bases these estimates on the performance in the initial markets, the existence of future firm commitments to sell and the past performance of similar television programs. 

For feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial theatrical release. For acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research 

II-38

(including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information. After their theatrical release the most sensitive factor affecting our estimates for feature films is the extent of home entertainment sales. In addition to theatrical performance, home entertainment sales vary based on a variety of factors including demand for our titles, the volume and quality of competing products, marketing and promotional strategies, as well as economic conditions.

Estimates of Ultimate Revenues for internally-produced television programming are updated regularly based on information available as the television program progresses through its life cycle. If Ultimate Revenue estimates are revised, the difference between amortization expense determined using the new estimate and any amounts previously expensed during that year are reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in the quarter in which the estimates are revised. Overestimating Ultimate Revenues for internally-produced programming could result in the understatement of the amortization of capitalized production costs and future net realizable value adjustments, as well as the misstatement of accruals for participation expense.

Acquired Program Rights

The costs incurred in acquiring television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the program is accepted and available for airing at the commencement of the license period. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. These costs are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. The economic benefit is determined based on management’s estimates of revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, which may differ from the contracted number of airings, and the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues an accelerated method of amortization is used. Management’s judgment is required in determining the value of the future economic benefit and the timing of the expensing of these costs.

The estimated economic benefit for acquired programming, including revenue projections for multi-year sports programming, are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term. A failure to adjust for a downward revision in the estimated economic benefit to be generated from acquired programming could result in the understatement of programming costs or future net realizable value adjustments.

The net realizable value of acquired programming is regularly evaluated either by title or on a daypart basis, which is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or an aggregation of programs of a similar type based on the specific demographic targeted by each respective program or program service. Net realizable value is determined by estimating advertising revenues to be derived from the future airing of the programming within the daypart and allocating affiliate revenues to the programming, each as applicable. An impairment charge may be necessary if our estimates of future cash flows are below the carrying value of the programming or if programming is abandoned.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test 

We perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses in the U.S. and broadcast licenses in Australia, on an annual basis and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value. 

Television FCC Licenses and International Broadcast Licenses—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2019, we had 14 television markets with FCC license book values. For broadcast licenses in Australia, we consider all of our broadcast licenses within the country to be a single unit of accounting because this represents their highest and best use. 

For our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each U.S. television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values, and for our Australian broadcast licenses when we estimate that the aggregate fair value significantly exceeds the carrying value. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2019 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all of our U.S. television markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as market share and capital expenditures. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates, as well as the impact from tax law changes that were enacted since the most recent quantitative tests were performed on these markets. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing the quantitative impairment test was unnecessary. 

A quantitative impairment test of broadcast licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.

For 2019, we performed a quantitative impairment test for our Australian broadcast licenses. The discount rate and perpetual nominal growth rate were 11% and 0.5%, respectively. The impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of the broadcast licenses was lower than the carrying value, which was the result of a sustained decline in the advertising marketplace in Australia. Accordingly, we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of 2019 of $20 million, which is included within “Depreciation and amortization” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

The estimated fair values of the FCC licenses and Australian broadcast licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace in the U.S. or further decline in the advertising marketplace in Australia could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; 

II-40

an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2019, we had six reporting units with goodwill balances, which were determined based on the post-Merger reporting structure. For the 2019 annual impairment test, the reporting units tested were those in place prior to the Merger, which closed after the testing dates. We tested two reporting units for impairment as of August 31 and eight reporting units as of October 31. 

For our annual impairment test, we perform a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit that management estimates has a fair value that significantly exceeds its respective carrying value. For the 2019 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for all of our reporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. We also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units, and that the lower tax rate from tax law changes enacted since the most recent quantitative tests would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying amount and therefore performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary. 

As of the closing date of the Merger on December 4, 2019, we performed qualitative assessments on the pre-Merger reporting units that were to be combined as a result of the new reporting structure, as well as the post-Merger reporting units that resulted from this combination. Based on these assessments, we concluded that there were no changes to the conclusions reached in our annual impairment test.

A quantitative goodwill impairment test, when performed, requires estimating fair value of a reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various judgmental assumptions, including assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash flows, growth rates and discount rates. 

Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a decrease in audience acceptance of programming, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Legal Matters

Estimates of liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. We continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. It is difficult to predict future asbestos 

II-41

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

Results of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)

(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. While we believe that our liabilities for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate to cover our liabilities, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Pensions

Pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2019, the unrecognized actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income increased from the prior year-end due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate, partially offset by the favorable performance of pension plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $137 million and would not have a material impact on 2020 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $8 million to 2020 pension expense.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions. When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $384 million at December 31, 2019 is properly recorded pursuant to the recognition and measurement provisions of FASB guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

Legal Matters 

General. On an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the below-described legal matters and other litigation to which we are a party are not likely, in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 

Litigation Relating to the Merger. On September 27, 2019, Bucks County Employees Retirement Fund (the “Bucks County Fund”), a purported holder of CBS Class B Common Stock, served us with a demand for inspection of books and records pursuant to 8 Del. C. § 220 in connection with the Merger (the “Demand”). On October 10, 2019, we offered to produce certain categories of documents properly within the scope of a books and records demand under § 220. The Bucks County Fund rejected our offer and filed litigation in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware on October 15, 2019, seeking to compel production of all documents requested in the Demand (the “Section 220 Complaint”). A trial on the Section 220 Complaint took place on November 22, 2019, and the Court ordered limited additional production on November 25, 2019. On December 2, 2019, we certified that we had completed production of all relevant documents. On February 20, 2020, the Bucks County Fund filed a putative derivative and class action complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against Shari Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust (“SMR Trust”), the CBS board of directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and ViacomCBS Inc. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders and waste in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses as well as other relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

On January 23, 2020, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware consolidated four putative class action suits filed by purported Viacom stockholders against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the Viacom special transaction committee of the Viacom board of directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish, in In re Viacom Inc. Stockholders Litigation. The four actions allege breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement, and seek unspecified damages, costs and expenses. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed the California Public Employees’ Retirement System as the lead plaintiff in the consolidated action. We believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Investigation-Related Matters. As announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors (the “CBS Board”) retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board’s determination, discussed below, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas from the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the New York City Commission on Human Rights regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters. The New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission have also requested information about these matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.

On August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, each of Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action suits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously. We are currently unable to determine a range of potential liability, if any. Accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Separation Agreement. On September 9, 2018, CBS entered into a separation and settlement agreement and releases (the “Separation Agreement”) with Mr. Moonves, pursuant to which Mr. Moonves resigned as a director and as Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of CBS. In October 2018, we contributed $120 million to a grantor trust pursuant to the Separation Agreement. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board announced that, following its consideration of the findings of the investigation referred to above, it had determined that there were grounds to terminate Mr. Moonves’ employment for cause under his employment agreement with CBS. Any dispute related to the CBS Board’s determination is subject to binding arbitration as set forth in the Separation Agreement. On January 16, 2019, Mr. Moonves commenced a binding arbitration proceeding with respect to this matter and the related CBS Board investigation, which proceeding is ongoing. The assets of the grantor trust will remain in the trust until a final determination in the arbitration. We are currently unable to determine the outcome of the arbitration and the amount, if any, that may be awarded thereunder and, accordingly, no accrual for this matter has been made in our consolidated financial statements.

Claims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos. We are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.

Claims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2019, we had pending approximately 30,950 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 31,570 as of December 31, 2018 and 31,660 as of December 31, 2017. During 2019, we received approximately 3,460 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 4,080 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other

factors. Our total costs for the years 2019 and 2018 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $58 million and $45 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.

Filings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are adequate to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.

Other. From time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.

Market Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $1.44 billion and $995 million, respectively. For 2019, $833 million related to future production costs and $606 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2018, $481 million related to future production costs and $514 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.

Interest Risk

Interest on commercial paper borrowings is exposed to risk related to movements in short-term interest rates. A 100 basis point change to the weighted average interest rate on commercial paper borrowings in 2019 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $7 million. In addition, interest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify both of these exposures at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2019 or 2018 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates. 

At December 31, 2019, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $17.98 billion and the estimated fair value was $20.6 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.22 billion and $2.68 billion, respectively.

Credit Risk

We continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.

Our receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2019 or 2018, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.
