Asset Impairment Reviews 

We review all of our long-lived assets for impairment indicators throughout the year. We perform impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill at least annually and for all other long-lived assets whenever impairment indicators are present. When necessary, we record charges for impairments of long-lived assets for the amount by which the fair value is less than the carrying value of these assets. Our impairment review processes are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 1L. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Amortization of Intangible Assets, Depreciation and Certain Long-Lived Assets.

Examples of events or circumstances that may be indicative of impairment include:

•A significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the asset. For example, a successful challenge of our patent rights would likely result in generic competition earlier than expected.

•A significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used. For example, restrictions imposed by the FDA or other regulatory authorities could affect our ability to manufacture or sell a product.

•A projection or forecast that indicates losses or reduced profits associated with an asset. This could result, for example, from a change in a government reimbursement program that results in an inability to sustain projected product revenues and profitability. This also could result from the introduction of a competitor’s product that results in a significant loss of market share or the inability to achieve the previously projected revenue growth, as well as the lack of acceptance of a product by patients, physicians and payers. For IPR&D projects, this could result from, among other things, a change in outlook based on clinical trial data, a delay in the projected launch date or additional expenditures to commercialize the product.

Identifiable Intangible Assets

As a result of our identifiable intangible asset impairment review work, we recognized a number of impairments of identifiable intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 4. Other (Income)/Deductions—Net.

When we are required to determine the fair value of intangible assets other than goodwill, we use an income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the asset, which includes the application of a terminal value for indefinite-lived assets, and then we apply an asset-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections and the impact of technological risk associated with IPR&D assets, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

While all intangible assets other than goodwill can face events and circumstances that can lead to impairment, in general, intangible assets other than goodwill that are most at risk of impairment include IPR&D assets (approximately $5.9 billion as of December 31, 2019) and newly acquired or recently impaired indefinite-lived brand assets. IPR&D assets are high-risk assets, as R&D is an inherently risky activity. Newly acquired and recently impaired indefinite-lived assets are more vulnerable to impairment as the assets are recorded at fair value and are then subsequently measured at the lower of fair value or carrying value at the end of each reporting period. As such, immediately after acquisition or impairment, even small declines in the outlook for these assets can negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying value and can result in an impairment charge.

Goodwill

As a result of our goodwill impairment review work, we concluded that none of our goodwill was impaired as of December 31, 2019, and we do not believe the risk of impairment is significant at this time.

We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Qualitative factors that we consider include, for example, macroeconomic and industry conditions, overall financial performance and other relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we then perform a quantitative fair value test.

When we are required to determine the fair value of a reporting unit, as appropriate for the individual reporting unit, we mainly use the income approach but we may also use the market approach, or a weighted-average combination of both approaches.

•The income approach is a forward-looking approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on internal forecasts. Within the income approach, the method that we use is the discounted cash flow method. We start with a forecast of all the expected net cash flows associated with the reporting unit, which includes the application of a terminal value, and then we apply a reporting unit-specific discount rate to arrive at a net present value amount. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the amount and timing of the projected net cash flows, which includes the expected impact of technological risk and competitive, legal and/or regulatory forces on the projections, as well as the selection of a long-term growth rate; the discount rate, which seeks to reflect the various risks inherent in the projected cash flows; and the tax rate, which seeks to incorporate the geographic diversity of the projected cash flows.

•The market approach is a historical approach to estimating fair value and relies primarily on external information. Within the market approach are two methods that we may use:

◦Guideline public company method—this method employs market multiples derived from market prices of stocks of companies that are engaged in the same or similar lines of business and that are actively traded on a free and open market and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.

Financial Review

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies

◦Guideline transaction method—this method relies on pricing multiples derived from transactions of significant interests in companies engaged in the same or similar lines of business and the application of the identified multiples to the corresponding measure of our reporting unit’s financial performance.

The market approach is only appropriate when the available external information is robust and deemed to be a reliable proxy for the specific reporting unit being valued; however, these assessments may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate. Some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in this approach include: the selection of appropriate guideline companies and transactions and the determination of applicable premiums and discounts based on any differences in ownership percentages, ownership rights, business ownership forms or marketability between the reporting unit and the guideline companies and transactions.

For all of our reporting units, there are a number of future events and factors that may impact future results and that could potentially have an impact on the outcome of subsequent goodwill impairment testing. For a list of these factors, see the “Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results” section of this Financial Review and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in our 2019 Form 10-K.

Benefit Plans

The majority of our employees worldwide are covered by defined benefit pension plans, defined contribution plans or both. In the U.S., we sponsor both IRC-qualified and supplemental (non-qualified) defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans, as well as other postretirement benefit plans consisting primarily of medical insurance for retirees and their eligible dependents. 

The accounting for benefit plans is highly dependent on actuarial estimates, assumptions and calculations, which can result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties. The assumptions and actuarial estimates required to estimate the net employee benefit obligations for the defined benefit and postretirement plans include the discount rate; expected salary increases; certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality (life expectancy); and healthcare cost trend rates.

Effective January 1, 2018, accruals for future benefits under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan (our largest U.S. defined benefit plan) and the defined benefit section of the Pfizer Group Pension Scheme (our largest pension plan in the U.K.) were frozen and resulted in elimination of future service costs for the plans. The Pfizer defined contribution savings plan provides additional annual contributions to those previously accruing benefits under the Pfizer Consolidated Pension Plan and active members of the Pfizer Group Pension Scheme started accruing benefits under the defined contribution section of that plan.

As of December 31, 2019, the noncurrent portion of our pension benefit obligations, net, increased by approximately $326 million, compared to December 31, 2018. The increase reflects, among other things, a decrease in the discount rate used in the measurement of plan obligations, partially offset by an increase in the actual returns on plan assets. As of December 31, 2019, the noncurrent portion of our postretirement benefit obligations, net decreased by approximately $247 million, compared to December 31, 2018. The decrease reflects, among other things, plan amendments related to the prescription drug coverage in our U.S. and Puerto Rico Postretirement Plans and changes to the claim cost assumptions, partially offset by the decrease in discount rate. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 11C. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans: Obligations and Funded Status.

Our assumptions reflect our historical experiences and our judgment regarding future expectations that have been deemed reasonable by management. The judgments made in determining the costs of our benefit plans can materially impact our results of operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) For detailed assumptions associated with our benefit plans, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 11B. Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans: Actuarial Assumptions.

Expected Annual Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The assumptions for the expected annual rate of return on all of our plan assets reflect our actual historical return experience and our long-term assessment of forward-looking return expectations by asset classes, which is used to develop a weighted-average expected return based on the implementation of our targeted asset allocation in our respective plans. 

The expected annual rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. plans and the majority of our international plans is applied to the fair value of plan assets at each year-end and the resulting amount is reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year.

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The actual return on plan assets was approximately $3.7 billion during 2019.

Discount Rate Used to Measure Plan Obligations

The weighted-average discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined at least annually and evaluated and modified, as required, to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better, that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. The discount rate used to measure the plan obligations for our international plans is determined at least annually by reference to investment grade corporate bonds, rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield-curve approach. These discount rate determinations are made in consideration of local requirements.

The measurement of the plan obligations at the end of the year will affect the amount of service cost, interest cost and amortization expense reflected in our net periodic benefit costs in the following year. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The change in the discount rates used in measuring our plan obligations as of December 31, 2019 resulted in an increase in the measurement of our aggregate plan obligations by approximately $3.2 billion.

Income Tax Assets and Liabilities

In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded an estimate of certain tax effects of the TCJA, including (i) the impact on deferred tax assets and liabilities from the reduction in the U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, (ii) the impact on valuation allowances and other state income tax considerations, (iii) a repatriation tax liability on accumulated post-1986 foreign earnings for which we elected, with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return, payment over eight years through 2026, and (iv) deferred taxes on basis differences expected to give rise to future taxes on global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, we had provided deferred tax liabilities in the past on foreign earnings that were not indefinitely reinvested. As a result of the TCJA, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we reversed an estimate of the deferred taxes that are no longer expected to be needed due to the change to the territorial tax system.

The TCJA subjects a U.S. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low-taxed income earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, states that we are permitted to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years or provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We elected to recognize deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as global intangible low-taxed income in future years. We were able to make a reasonable estimate of the deferred taxes on the temporary differences expected to reverse in the future and provided a provisional deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017.

In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA based on our best estimates of available information and data, and reported and disclosed the impacts within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC. We believe that there may be additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance from the U.S. Department of Treasury. Any change to our calculations resulting from such additional interpretations, clarifications and guidance would be reflected in the period of issuance. In addition, our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards. The current portion of the aforementioned repatriation tax liability is reported in current Income taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (approximately $600 million due in April 2020) and the remaining liability is reported in noncurrent Other taxes payable in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The first installment of $750 million was paid in April 2019.

Income tax assets and liabilities also include income tax valuation allowances and accruals for uncertain tax positions.

Revenues—Overview

Total revenues in 2019 compared to 2018 reflects an operational decline of $545 million, or 1%, and an unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.4 billion, or 3% in 2019 compared to 2018.

Total revenues in 2018 compared to 2017 reflects an operational increase of $791 million, or 2%, and the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $310 million, or less than 1%, in 2018 compared to 2017. 

See the “Revenues by Segment and Geography” and “Revenues—Selected Product Discussion” sections of this Financial Review for additional analyses.

Certain of our current products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face significantly increased generic competition over the next few years. For additional information, see the “Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights” section in Part I, Item 1, “Business” of our 2019 Form 10-K.

We have significant operations outside the U.S., with revenues exceeding $500 million in eleven countries in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.

By total revenues, the U.S., China and Japan are our three largest national markets:

Inventory Stocking

Our policy relating to the supply of pharmaceutical inventory at domestic wholesalers, and in major international markets, is to generally maintain stocking levels under one month on average and to keep monthly levels consistent from year to year based on patterns of utilization. We historically have been able to closely monitor these customer stocking levels by purchasing information from our customers directly or by obtaining other third-party information. We believe our data sources to be directionally reliable but cannot verify their accuracy. Further, as we do not control this third-party data, we cannot be assured of continuing access. Unusual buying patterns and utilization are promptly investigated.

Revenue Deductions

Our gross product revenues are subject to a variety of deductions, which generally are estimated and recorded in the same period that the revenues are recognized. Such variable consideration represents chargebacks, rebates, sales allowances and sales returns. These deductions represent estimates of related obligations and, as such, knowledge and judgment are required when estimating the impact of these revenue deductions on gross sales for a reporting period. Historically, our adjustments of estimates, to reflect actual results or updated expectations, have not been material to our overall business. On a quarterly basis, our adjustments of estimates to reflect actual results generally have been less than 1% of revenues, and have resulted in either a net increase or a net decrease in revenues. Product-specific rebates, however, can have a significant impact on year-over-year individual product growth trends.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Rebates are product-specific and, therefore, for any given year are impacted by the mix of products sold.

(b) Performance-based contract rebates include contract rebates with MCOs within the U.S., including health maintenance organizations and PBMs, who receive rebates based on the achievement of contracted performance terms and claims under these contracts. Outside the U.S., performance-based contract rebates include rebates to wholesalers/distributors based on achievement of contracted performance for specific products or sales milestones.

(c) Chargebacks primarily represent reimbursements to U.S. wholesalers for honoring contracted prices to third parties.

(d) Sales allowances primarily represent price reductions that are contractual or legislatively mandated outside the U.S., discounts and distribution fees.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total revenue deductions for 2019 decreased 5% compared to 2018, primarily as a result of:

•a decrease in chargebacks primarily related to Upjohn products, including Viagra and Lyrica; and 

•a decrease in Medicare rebates, driven by a significant decrease in Lyrica sales in the U.S. due to multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019,

partially offset by:

•an increase in performance-based contract rebates, primarily in the U.S. due to increased sales of certain Biopharma products, slightly offset by decreased Lyrica sales.

•Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13 (Biopharma): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decline in 2019 in the U.S. primarily reflects the continued decline in revenues for the adult indication due to a high initial capture rate of the eligible population following its successful fourth-quarter 2014 launch, which resulted in a smaller remaining “catch up” opportunity (i.e., the opportunity to reach adults aged 65 years and older who have not been previously vaccinated with Prevnar 13) as well as lower government purchases for the pediatric indication.

The operational growth in 2019 internationally was primarily driven by the pediatric indication due to higher volumes reflecting continued uptake in China, favorable impact of timing and increased volumes associated with government purchases for the pediatric indication in certain emerging markets and higher volumes resulting from increased shipments associated with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

In 2014, the ACIP voted to recommend Prevnar 13 for routine use to help protect adults aged 65 years and older against pneumococcal disease, which for adults includes pneumonia caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes included in the vaccine. These ACIP recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors at the CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and were published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in September 2014 by the CDC. The CDC regularly monitors the impact of vaccination and reviews the recommendations. During the February 2019 ACIP meeting, the CDC presented a formal evaluation of evidence to the recommendation framework (grading) for ACIP’s input. On June 26, 2019, the ACIP voted to revise the pneumococcal vaccination guidelines and recommend Prevnar 13 for adults 65 and older based on the shared clinical decision making of the provider and patient, which means the decision to vaccinate should be made at the individual level between health care providers and their patients, maintaining reimbursement. The recommendation reaffirms that there remains vaccine preventable pneumococcal disease in the population of adults 65 years or older, which may be prevented through direct vaccination. The ACIP’s recommendation was approved by the directors at the CDC and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and published by the CDC in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report in the fourth quarter of 2019. While the ACIP’s latest recommendation did not have an impact on Prevnar 13 revenues in 2019, due to timing of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report publication, we expect Prevnar 13 revenues from the adult indication to continue to decline in 2020 and beyond.

•Ibrance (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The operational growth in 2019 in international markets reflects the continued strong uptake in developed Europe and Japan as well as in certain emerging markets following launches, partially offset by pricing pressure primarily in certain developed Europe markets beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019. The growth in 2019 in the U.S. was mainly driven by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) class share growth and Ibrance’s continued CDK class share leadership in its approved metastatic breast cancer indications.

•Eliquis alliance revenues and direct sales (Biopharma): Eliquis has been jointly developed and is commercialized by Pfizer and BMS. Pfizer funds between 50% and 60% of all development costs depending on the study. Profits and losses are shared equally on a global basis, except in certain countries where Pfizer commercializes Eliquis and pays BMS compensation based on a percentage of net sales. We have full commercialization rights in certain smaller markets. BMS supplies the product to us at cost plus a percentage of the net sales to end-customers in these markets. Eliquis is part of the Novel Oral Anticoagulant market; the agents in this class were developed as alternative treatment options to warfarin in appropriate patients.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational growth in 2019 was mostly driven by continued increased adoption in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, as well as oral anti-coagulant market share gains, partially offset by a higher Medicare “coverage gap” discount provision on U.S. revenues compared to the prior year.

•Lyrica (Upjohn):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The declines in 2019 in the U.S. were due to the expected significantly lower volumes driven by multi-source generic competition which began in July 2019.

The operational decline internationally in 2019 was primarily due to generic competition in developed Europe markets and pricing pressures across international markets, partially offset by increased volumes in Japan attributable to growth in the orally dissolving tablet formulation, and increased volumes in Russia and China.

•Xeljanz (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The growth in the U.S. in 2019 was primarily due to continued growth in the RA indication driven by access improvements, and by volume growth from the launches of the UC and PsA indications in 2018, partially offset by higher rebating from new commercial contracts.

The operational growth internationally in 2019 was mainly driven by continued uptake in the RA indication in developed Europe, emerging markets, Japan and Canada as well as from the recent launch of the UC indication in certain developed markets.

In July and December 2019, the FDA updated the U.S. prescribing information for Xeljanz to include three additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indication and dosing for UC. In January 2020, the EC revised the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Xeljanz to include new warnings and recommendations for use of Xeljanz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism, and, due to an increased risk of infections, revised warnings in patients older than 65 years of age. These updates were based on the FDA’s and EMA’s review of 10 mg data from the ongoing post-marketing requirement RA study A3921133. We expect these updates to moderate growth. See the “Analysis of Consolidated Statements of Income—Product Development—Biopharmaceuticals” section of this Financial Review.

•Lipitor (Upjohn):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational revenue was flat in 2019 mostly due to overall increased demand in China in the first quarter of 2019 and continued geographic expansion during the second half of 2019 in provinces where the VBP program had not yet been implemented, offset by pricing pressures in China resulting from the VBP implementation in certain cities, discontinued sales in Saudi Arabia and lower volumes in Japan.

•Enbrel (Biopharma, outside the U.S. and Canada):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational decline in 2019 was primarily due to ongoing biosimilar competition in most developed Europe markets, which is expected to continue.

•Chantix/Champix (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The growth in the U.S. in 2019 was primarily due to stronger demand. The operational decline internationally in 2019 was mainly driven by generic entry in South Korea and Canada.

•Norvasc (Upjohn):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational decline in 2019 was primarily due to pricing pressures in China resulting from the VBP implementation in certain cities and lower volumes in Japan, partially offset by overall increased demand in China in the first quarter of 2019 and continued geographic expansion during the second half of 2019 in provinces where the VBP had not yet been implemented.

•Sutent (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational decline in 2019 reflects continued erosion as a result of increased competition in the U.S. and key developed markets, partially offset by growth in certain emerging markets.

•Xtandi alliance revenues (Biopharma): Xtandi is being developed and commercialized through a collaboration with Astellas. The two companies share equally in the gross profits (losses) related to U.S. net sales of Xtandi. Subject to certain exceptions, Pfizer and Astellas also share equally all Xtandi commercialization costs attributable to the U.S. market. Pfizer and Astellas also share certain development and other collaboration expenses, and Pfizer receives tiered royalties as a percentage of international Xtandi net sales (recorded in Other (income)/deductions—net).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The growth in the U.S. in 2019 was primarily driven by increased demand for Xtandi in metastatic (mCRPC) and non-metastatic (nmCRPC) castration-resistant prostate cancer. Revenues continue to be unfavorably impacted by patient assistance programs (PAP) utilization.

•The Premarin family of products (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational decline in 2019 was primarily driven by continued competitive pressures in the U.S., which is expected to continue.

•Celebrex (Upjohn):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational growth in 2019 was mainly due to higher volumes in China, driven by investments in geographic expansion, and higher volumes in Japan, partially offset by pricing pressures in certain emerging markets. 

•Sulperazon (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The international operational growth in 2019 was mostly due to increased demand in China.

•Inflectra/Remsima (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Worldwide operational revenues were relatively flat in 2019 due to continued volume growth in the U.S., as well as in certain developed markets in Europe and Canada, offset by pricing pressures globally as well as competitive pressures internationally.

The growth in the U.S. in 2019 was primarily driven by demand in open systems, partially offset by price erosion. While Inflectra has achieved parity access to Remicade® (infliximab) in Medicare Part B, nearly half of all commercial patients are not able to access Inflectra due to exclusionary contracting practices by J&J. In September 2017, Pfizer filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against J&J alleging that J&J’s exclusionary contracts and other anticompetitive practices concerning Remicade violate federal antitrust laws. In June 2019, Pfizer received a Civil Investigative Demand from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) seeking documents and information relating to the alleged conduct and market conditions at issue in Pfizer’s lawsuit against J&J. Pfizer understands that the FTC’s investigation is focused on J&J’s alleged conduct at issue in Pfizer’s lawsuit against J&J.

•Xalkori (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational growth in 2019 primarily resulted from growth in China, following the impact of inclusion of Xalkori in the 2019 National Reimbursement Drug Listing, partially offset by erosion due to competition in developed Europe and in the U.S.

•Viagra (Upjohn)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decline in the U.S. in 2019 was driven by the loss of exclusivity in December 2017. The operational growth internationally in 2019 was mostly due to increased retail demand growth in China, partially offset by pricing pressures in China and lower volumes across certain developed and certain emerging markets.

•Inlyta (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The worldwide operational growth in 2019 was primarily due to increased demand in the U.S. as a result of the FDA approvals in the second quarter of 2019 for combinations of certain immune checkpoint inhibitors plus Inlyta for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC. 

•Vyndaqel/Vyndamax (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The growth in the U.S. was driven by the launches in May 2019 of Vyndaqel and in September 2019 of Vyndamax, for the treatment of transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM). The operational growth in international markets was primarily driven by continued uptake for the transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy indication, primarily in developed Europe, as well as the March 2019 launch of the ATTR-CM indication in Japan.

•Eucrisa (Biopharma):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decline in the U.S. in 2019 was primarily driven by higher rebating and unfavorable channel mix, in addition to favorable rebate adjustments in 2018, partially offset by volume growth.

•Alliance revenues (Biopharma):

In November 2019, we and our partner Merck KGaA, Germany, announced the topline results of the Phase III JAVELIN Gastric 100 study evaluating avelumab as first-line maintenance therapy following induction chemotherapy in patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer versus continuation of chemotherapy or best supportive care. While the study showed clinical activity for avelumab in this setting, it did not meet the primary endpoints of superior overall survival compared with the standard of care in the overall intent-to-treat population. No new safety signals were observed, and the safety profile for avelumab in this trial was consistent with that observed in the overall JAVELIN clinical development program.

In February 2019, the company took steps to transition rheumatoid arthritis study patients who were on tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily to tofacitinib 5 mg twice daily in the ongoing FDA post-marketing requirement study A3921133, a study performed in patients considered to be at high risk for certain side effects. This action was taken as the result of notification from the tofacitinib Rheumatology Data Safety Monitoring Board of a safety signal regarding the tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily treatment arm in study A3921133. The 5 mg twice daily dose is the FDA approved dose in the U.S. for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. In July 2019, the FDA updated the U.S. prescribing information for Xeljanz to include two additional boxed warnings as well as changes to the indication and dosing for UC. These updates were based on the FDA’s review of data from the ongoing post-marketing requirement RA study A3921133. In January 2020, the EC revised the summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for Xeljanz to include new warnings and recommendations for use of Xeljanz due to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism and, due to an increased risk of infections, revised warnings in patients older than 65 years of age. These updates were based on the FDA’s and EMA’s review of data from the ongoing post-marketing requirement rheumatoid arthritis study A3921133.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

The changes in expenses below reflect, among other things, a decline in expenses resulting from the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare JV transaction with GSK. Our financial results, and our Consumer Healthcare segment’s operating results, for 2019 reflect seven months of Consumer Healthcare segment domestic operations and eight months of Consumer Healthcare segment international operations.

Cost of Sales

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 v. 2018 

Cost of sales decreased $1.0 billion, or 9% in 2019, compared to 2018, primarily due to:

•the favorable impact of the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction with GSK;

•the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $279 million; 

•the favorable impact of hedging activity on intercompany inventory of $261 million; and

•lower royalty expense for Lyrica due to the patent expiration,

partially offset by:

•an unfavorable change in product mix.

The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2019, compared to 2018, was primarily due to all of the factors discussed above, as well an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales, partially offset by lower Lyrica revenues in developed markets, due to U.S. multi-source generic competition that began in July 2019.

2018 v. 2017 

Cost of sales increased $21 million, or were relatively flat, in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to:

•increased sales volumes mostly related to key products within our product portfolio; 

•higher costs across the legacy SIP portfolio, as a result of the complexity of high quality product manufacture across the legacy Hospira plants, which was partially offset by decreases in other costs across various markets;

•an increase in royalty expenses based on the mix of products sold; and

•the unfavorable impact of hedging activity on intercompany inventory of $65 million,

partially offset by:

•lower volumes from the legacy SIP portfolio, in developed markets, primarily due to increased competition across the legacy SIP portfolio and continued legacy Hospira product shortages in the U.S.;

•the non-recurrence of $195 million in inventory losses, overhead costs, and incremental costs related to the period in 2017 during which our Puerto Rico plants were not operational due to hurricanes; 

•the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $153 million;

•the non-recurrence of charges related to a product recall that occurred in 2017; and

•the favorable impact of the sale of HIS of $35 million.

The decrease in Cost of sales as a percentage of revenues in 2018, compared to 2017, was mainly due to all of the factors discussed above, as well as an increase in alliance revenues, which have no associated cost of sales.

Selling, Informational and Administrative (SI&A) Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 v. 2018 

SI&A expenses decreased $105 million, or 1%, in 2019, compared to 2018, mostly due to:

•the favorable impact of the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK;

•reduction in field force expense as well as advertising and promotion expenses in developed markets, primarily related to Lyrica in the U.S.; and

•the favorable impact of foreign exchange of $291 million,

partially offset by:

•additional Biopharma investment in emerging markets; 

•separation costs of $127 million associated with our planned Upjohn transaction with Mylan;

•additional investment in the Oncology portfolio in developed markets;

•increased employee deferred compensation as a result of savings plan gains;

•an increase due to the timing of expenses (i.e., insurance recoveries and product donations);

•marketing and promotional expenses associated with the U.S. launches of Vyndaqel in May 2019 and Vyndamax in September 2019; 

•costs to separate Consumer Healthcare;

•increased healthcare reform expenses; and

•Upjohn investments in China across key brands.

2018 v. 2017 

SI&A expenses decreased $350 million, or 2%, in 2018, compared to 2017, mainly due to:

•lower advertising, promotional and field force expenses, as well as general and administrative expenses, reflecting the benefits of cost-reduction and productivity initiatives;

•the non-recurrence of a $200 million charitable contribution to the Pfizer Foundation;

•decreased investment across several of our key products, primarily Viagra and Enbrel; and

•lower healthcare reform expenses as a result of a true up of the prior year amount,

partially offset by:

•additional investment across several of our key products, primarily, Xeljanz, Ibrance, Eucrisa and Prevnar 13/Prevenar 13;

•additional investments in China; and

•a special, one-time bonus paid to virtually all Pfizer colleagues, excluding executives, of $119 million, in the aggregate, in the first quarter of 2018.

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 v. 2018

R&D expenses increased $644 million, or 8%, in 2019, compared to 2018, mainly due to:

•upfront payments to Therachon and Akcea (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements);

•increased investments towards building new capabilities and driving automation; 

•increased spending on our Inflammation & Immunology and Rare Disease portfolios due to several Phase 3 programs and 

investment in gene therapy;

•increased spending related to assets acquired from Array; and

•increased medical spend for new and growing products, 

partially offset by:

•decreased spending across the Oncology, Vaccines and Internal Medicine portfolios, as select programs have reached completion;

•a decrease in the value of the portfolio performance share grants reflecting changes in the price of Pfizer’s common stock, as well as management’s assessment of the probability that the specified performance criteria will be achieved;

•the discontinuation of the Staphylococcus aureus vaccine trial;

•the favorable impact of the July 31, 2019 completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK; and

•the favorable impact of foreign exchange.

2018 v. 2017

R&D expenses increased $322 million, or 4%, in 2018, compared to 2017, mainly due to: 

•increased costs associated with our Phase 3 clinical trials related to our JAK1 inhibitor (which was initiated in December 2017) and the C. difficile vaccine program (which was initiated in March 2017) as well as increased spending for our 20 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine candidate;

•increased costs associated with the Bavencio program; and

Amortization of Intangible Assets

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Amortization of intangible assets decreased $283 million, or 6%, in 2019, compared to 2018, mainly due to the non-recurrence of amortization expense as a result of the impairment of sterile injectable products in the fourth quarter of 2018 (recorded in Other (income)/deductions––net), fully amortized assets and the contribution of our Consumer Healthcare business to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture with GSK, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related to assets recorded as a result of the approval of Xtandi in the U.S. for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer in July of 2018 and amortization of intangible assets as a result of our acquisition of Array.

Amortization of intangible assets increased $135 million, or 3%, in 2018, compared to 2017, primarily due to amortization expense of approximately $151 million (pre-tax) in 2018 associated with the approval of Xtandi in the U.S. for the treatment of non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The U.S. approval resulted in the transfer of $2.7 billion from an indefinite-lived IPR&D intangible asset to a finite-lived Developed technology rights intangible asset.

Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Restructuring charges/(credits)––acquisition-related costs include employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs associated with business combinations. Credits for 2019 were mostly due to the reversal of certain accruals related to our acquisition of Wyeth upon the effective favorable settlement of an IRS audit for multiple tax years. See Notes Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5D. Tax Matters: Tax Contingencies. Charges for 2018 were mainly due to asset write downs, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs related to our acquisition of Hospira. Restructuring charges for 2017 mainly related to our acquisitions of Hospira and Medivation and were primarily due to asset write-downs, partially offset by the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs.

(b) Restructuring charges/(credits)––cost reduction initiatives relate to employee termination costs, asset impairments and other exit costs not associated with acquisitions. For 2019, the charges were mostly related to employee termination costs. For 2018, the charges were mostly related to employee termination costs and asset write downs. The employee termination costs for 2019 and 2018 were primarily associated with our improvements to operational effectiveness as part of the realignment of our organizational structure, and for 2019, also includes employee termination costs associated with the Transforming to a More Focused Company initiative. For 2017, the credits were mostly related to the reversal of previously recorded accruals for employee termination costs, partially offset by asset write downs.

2017-2019 Initiatives and Organizing for Growth

During 2018, we determined that at the start of our 2019 fiscal year, we would begin operating under our new commercial structure, which reorganized our operations into three businesses––Biopharma, a science-based innovative medicines business; Upjohn, a global, primarily off-patent branded and generic established medicines business; and through July 31, 2019, a Consumer Healthcare business. To operate effectively in this structure and position ourselves for future growth, we focused on creating a simpler, more efficient operating structure within each business as well as the functions that support them. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, we reviewed previously planned initiatives and new initiatives to ensure that there was alignment around our new structure and combined the 2017-2019 initiatives with our current Organizing for Growth initiatives to form one cohesive plan. For the combined programs, we achieved savings of approximately $1.6 billion and incurred approximately $2.1 billion in costs over the three-year period 2017-2019. Savings of approximately $500 million were reinvested in our R&D pipeline and in selling and marketing to support our current and recently launched products and indications.

Transforming to a More Focused Company

With the formation of the GSK Consumer Healthcare venture and the pending combination of Upjohn with Mylan, Pfizer is transforming itself into a more focused, global leader in science-based innovative medicines. As a result, we began, in the fourth quarter of 2019, to identify and undertake efforts to ensure our cost base aligns appropriately with our Biopharmaceutical revenue base, which is expected to be 20% less (based on the midpoint of the range for 2020 New Pfizer revenue guidance (see the “Our Financial Guidance for 2020” section of this Financial Review), compared to 2019 total company reported revenue) as a result of both the completed Consumer Healthcare and expected Upjohn transactions. While certain direct costs have transferred or will transfer to the Consumer Healthcare joint venture and to the Upjohn entities, there are indirect costs which are not expected to transfer. In addition, we are taking steps to restructure our organizations to appropriately support and drive the purpose of the three core functions of our focused innovative medicines business: R&D, Manufacturing and Commercial. We expect the costs associated with this multi-year effort to continue through 2022 and to total approximately $1.4 billion on a pre-tax basis and approximately 10% of this to be non-cash. Actions may include, among others, changes in location of certain activities, expanded use and co-location of centers of excellence and shared services, and increased use of digital technologies. The associated actions and the specific costs are currently in development but will include severance and benefit plan impacts, exit costs as well as associated implementation costs.

We expect net cost savings of about $1.0 billion to be achieved over the three-year period 2020-2022. Certain qualifying costs associated with this program were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 and are reflected as Certain Significant Items and excluded from our non-GAAP measure of Adjusted Income. See the “Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income)” section of this Financial Review for additional information. These savings are expected to be realized primarily in procurement and in enabling functions (as described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 17A. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information: Segment Information).

For additional information about this program and expected and actual total costs, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 3. Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives.

In addition to these major initiatives, we continuously monitor our operations for cost reduction and/or productivity opportunities, especially in light of the losses of exclusivity and the expiration of collaborative arrangements for various products.

partially offset by:

•an increase in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years, primarily due to a benefit of $1.4 billion, representing tax and interest, resulting from the favorable settlement of a U.S. IRS audit;

•benefits related to certain tax initiatives associated with the implementation of our new organizational structure;

•the tax benefit recorded as a result of additional guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury related to the enactment of the TCJA; and

•the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business.

2018 v. 2017

The higher effective tax rate in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of:

•the non-recurrence of a $10.7 billion tax benefit recorded in 2017 to reflect the enactment of the TCJA,

partially offset by:

•tax benefits related to the TCJA, including certain 2018 tax initiatives as well as favorable adjustments to the provisional estimate of the impact of the legislation, reported and disclosed within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC;

•the favorable change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings as a result of operating fluctuations in the normal course of business; as well as

•an increase in tax benefits associated with the resolution of certain tax positions pertaining to prior years primarily with various foreign tax authorities, and the expiration of certain statutes of limitations. 

For details about discrete elements that impacted our tax provisions, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations.

Changes in Tax Laws

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted significant changes to U.S. tax law following the passage and signing of the TCJA. The TCJA is complex and significantly changes the U.S. corporate income tax system by, among other things, reducing the U.S. Federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, transitioning U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system and imposing a repatriation tax on deemed repatriated accumulated post-1986 earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In accordance with guidance issued by the SEC we recorded provisional estimates of the legislation in the fourth-quarter 2017. In 2018, we finalized our provisional accounting for the tax effects of the TCJA based on our best estimates of available information and data, and have reported and disclosed the impacts within the applicable measurement period, in accordance with guidance issued by the SEC. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A.

On January 23, 2017, the Governor of Puerto Rico signed into law Act No. 3-2017, amending Section 2101 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 1994, which imposes an excise tax that was effective beginning in 2011 (Act 154). The excise tax is imposed on the purchase of products by multinational corporations and their affiliates from their Puerto Rico affiliates. As originally adopted, the excise tax was to be in effect from 2011 through 2016 and the tax rate was to decline over time from 4% in 2011 to 1% in 2016. Act No. 2-2013 extended the excise tax through 2017 and, effective July 1, 2013, increased the tax rate to 4% for all years through 2017. Act No. 3-2017 further extended the excise tax for all years through 2027 at a rate of 4%. The excise tax has been recorded in Cost of sales and Provision/(benefit) for taxes on income, as appropriate. All expected impacts in 2020 have been reflected in our financial guidance for 2020.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE (ADJUSTED INCOME)

General Description of Non-GAAP Financial Measure (Adjusted Income)

Adjusted income is an alternative view of performance used by management. We measure the performance of the overall Company on this basis in conjunction with other performance metrics. Because Adjusted income is an important internal measurement for Pfizer, we believe that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this performance measure. We report Adjusted income, certain components of Adjusted income, and Adjusted diluted earnings per share in order to portray the results of our major operations––the discovery, development, manufacture, marketing and sale of prescription medicines and vaccines––prior to considering certain income statement elements. We have defined Adjusted income as Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items, which are described below. Similarly, we have defined the Adjusted income components as Cost of sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses, Research and development expenses, Amortization of intangible assets and Other (income)/deductions––net each before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs and certain significant items. We have defined Adjusted diluted earnings per share as Earnings per common share attributable to Pfizer Inc.––diluted before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. The Adjusted income measure, the Adjusted income component measures and the Adjusted diluted earnings per share measure are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income, U.S. GAAP net income components or U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share. 

The following are examples of how the Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures are utilized:

•senior management receives a monthly analysis of our operating results that is prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis;

•our annual budgets are prepared on an Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share basis; and

•senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures. The bonus plans for virtually all bonus-eligible, non-sales-force employees worldwide, including the Executive Leadership Team members

and other members of senior management, are funded from a pool based on the performance measured by three financial metrics, including Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which is derived from Adjusted income. This metric accounts for 40% of the bonus pool funding. In addition, effective in 2019, Adjusted net income, which is derived from Adjusted income, is one of the measures utilized to determine payout for PSAs and is used for performance years starting in 2019, except for the 2017 PSA grant that used the previous metric, Adjusted operating income.

Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, are limited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, Adjusted income and its components (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components) and Adjusted diluted earnings per share (unlike U.S. GAAP diluted earnings per share) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.

We also recognize that, as internal measures of performance, the Adjusted income and its components and Adjusted diluted earnings per share measures have limitations, and we do not restrict our performance-management process solely to these metrics. A limitation of these measures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, such as the effects of an acquisition or amortization of purchased intangibles, and do not provide a comparable view of our performance to other companies in the biopharmaceutical industry. We also use other specifically tailored tools designed to achieve the highest levels of performance. For example, our R&D organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is measured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharmaceutical index, plays a significant role in determining payouts under certain of Pfizer’s long-term incentive compensation plans.

See the accompanying reconciliations of certain GAAP reported to non-GAAP adjusted information for 2019, 2018 and 2017 below.

Purchase Accounting Adjustments

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts, primarily associated with Wyeth (acquired in 2009), Hospira (acquired in 2015), Anacor (acquired in 2016) and Medivation (acquired in 2016), can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets (primarily manufacturing facilities), amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes associated with contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.

Certain of the purchase accounting adjustments can occur through 20 or more years, but this presentation provides an alternative view of our performance that is used by management to internally assess business performance. We believe the elimination of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our business results by trying to provide a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&D costs previously have been expensed.

However, a completely accurate comparison of internally developed intangible assets and acquired intangible assets cannot be achieved through Adjusted income. This component of Adjusted income is derived solely from the impacts of the items listed in the first paragraph of this section. We have not factored in the impacts of any other differences in experience that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, and this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred in those circumstances. For example, our R&D costs in total, and in the periods presented, may have been different; our speed to commercialization and resulting sales, if any, may have been different; or our costs to manufacture may have been different. In addition, our marketing efforts may have been received differently by our customers. As such, in total, there can be no assurance that our Adjusted income amounts would have been the same as presented had we discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets.

Acquisition-Related Costs

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs associated with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate two businesses as a result of the acquisition decision. For additional clarity, only transaction costs, additional depreciation and restructuring and integration activities that are associated with a business combination or a net-asset acquisition are included in acquisition-related costs. We have made no adjustments for the resulting synergies.

We believe that viewing income prior to considering these charges provides investors with a useful additional perspective because the significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees––a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that the costs incurred to convert disparate systems, to close duplicative facilities or to eliminate duplicate positions (for example, in the context of a business combination) can be viewed differently from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts.

The integration and restructuring costs associated with a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy. For example, due to the highly regulated nature of the pharmaceutical business, the closure of excess facilities can take several years, as all manufacturing changes are subject to extensive validation and testing and must be approved by the FDA and/or other global regulatory authorities.

Discontinued Operations

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering the results of operations included in discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our businesses and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our businesses with the intent to sell them. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.

Certain Significant Items

Adjusted income is calculated prior to considering certain significant items. Certain significant items represent substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated on an individual basis. Such evaluation considers both the quantitative and the qualitative aspects of their nature. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs stand on their own as they are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, but we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to loss of exclusivity or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Unusual items may represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. While not all-inclusive, examples of items that could be included as certain significant items would be gains on the completion of joint venture transactions such as the gain on the completion of the Consumer Healthcare joint venture transaction discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 2C. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements: Equity-Method Investment and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, a major non-acquisition-related restructuring charge and associated implementation costs; amounts related to certain disposals of businesses, products or facilities that do not qualify as discontinued operations under U.S. GAAP; certain intangible asset impairments; adjustments related to the resolution of certain tax positions; the impact of adopting certain significant, event-driven tax legislation, such as the TCJA discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations or charges related to certain legal matters, such as certain of those discussed in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 16A. Contingencies and Certain Commitments: Legal Proceedings and in Part II, Item 1, “Legal Proceedings” in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Normal, ongoing defense costs of the Company or settlements of and accruals for legal matters made in the normal course of our business would not be considered certain significant items.

Beginning in 2019, we exclude the gains and losses from equity securities from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe that including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. For example, in 2018, we contributed assets related to our allogeneic CAR T therapy to Allogene and received equity securities. We have revised Adjusted income and Adjusted diluted EPS for prior periods for consistency with our 2019 presentation.

For information purposes only, the following tables present reconciliations of the Biopharma segment operating results and Upjohn segment operating results to Biopharma and Upjohn operating results including estimated Other costs generally associated with the Biopharma and Upjohn operating segments for 2019. While we do not manage our segments or have performance goals under such an allocated manner, we believe that some investors may find this information useful in their analyses. 

The estimated Other costs generally associated with our operating segments do not purport to reflect the additional amounts that each of our operating segments would have incurred had each segment operated as a standalone company during the period presented.

In the consolidated statements of cash flows, the line item, Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, is presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these changes do not reflect actual cash inflows or outflows, and excluding any other significant non-cash movements. Accordingly, the amounts shown will not necessarily agree with the changes in the assets and liabilities that are presented in our consolidated balance sheets.

Operating Activities

2019 v. 2018

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $12.6 billion in 2019, compared to $15.8 billion in 2018. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business, the upfront cash payment associated with our acquisition of Therachon, and the upfront cash payment associated with our licensing agreement with Akcea (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 2A. Acquisitions, Divestitures, Equity-Method Investments and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale, Licensing Arrangements and Research and Development and Collaborative Arrangements: Acquisitions), partially offset by an increase in net income and a decrease in benefit plan contributions.

In 2019, the change in the line item Other adjustments, net primarily reflects, among other items:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

partially offset by:

•net gains on foreign exchange contracts hedging a portion of our forecasted intercompany inventory sales (that fixes the cost of inventory sold later to customers).

In 2019 and 2018, the line item Other changes in assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions and divestitures, primarily reflects changes, in the normal course of business, in trade accounts receivable, inventories, other current assets, other noncurrent assets, trade accounts payable, accrued compensation, other current and noncurrent liabilities, as well as in 2019, the adjustment necessary to reflect the non-cash nature of a favorable settlement of a U.S. IRS audit for multiple tax years (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations).

2018 v. 2017

Our net cash provided by operating activities was $15.8 billion in 2018, compared to $16.8 billion in 2017. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities reflects a decrease in net cash generated from net income. The net cash generated reflects the timing of receipts from customers and payments to vendors in the ordinary course of business. 

In 2018, the change in the line item Other adjustments, net primarily reflects, among other items:

•the non-recurrence of a non-cash net loss on early retirement of debt under an exchange offer in 2017;

•unrealized net gains on equity securities resulting from the adoption of a new accounting standard on January 1, 2018, related to the recognition and measurement of financial assets and liabilities;

We rely largely on operating cash flows, short-term investments, short-term commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt to provide for our liquidity requirements. We continue our efforts to improve cash inflows through working capital efficiencies. We target specific areas of focus including accounts receivable, inventories, accounts payable, and other working capital, which allows us to optimize our operating cash flows.

Financial Review

Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies

Due to our significant operating cash flows as well as our financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future, which include:

•the working capital requirements of our operations, including our R&D activities;

•investments in our business;

•dividend payments and potential increases in the dividend rate;

•share repurchases;

•the cash requirements associated with our cost-reduction/productivity initiatives;

•paying down outstanding debt;

•contributions to our pension and postretirement plans; and

•business-development activities.

Our long-term debt is rated high-quality by both S&P and Moody’s. See the “Credit Ratings” section below. As market conditions change, we continue to monitor our liquidity position. We have taken and will continue to take a conservative approach to our financial investments. Both short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of high-quality, highly liquid, well-diversified available-for-sale debt securities.

(a) See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7. Financial Instruments for a description of certain assets held and for a description of credit risk related to our financial instruments held.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(c) The decrease in working capital was primarily due to:

•financing requirements for the acquisition of Array, share repurchase activities, dividend payments, capital expenditures and debt repayment, partially offset by operating cash flow generation, cash from employee stock option exercises and the March 2019 long-term debt issuance discussed below;

•the impact of the deconsolidation of the Consumer Healthcare business as a result of the completion of the joint venture transaction; and

•the net impact of foreign currency exchange,

partially offset by:

•the timing of accruals, cash receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business; and[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d) Represents total Pfizer Inc. shareholders’ equity divided by the actual number of common shares outstanding (which excludes treasury stock).

On February 11, 2020, we issued a notice for the redemption in full of all $1.065 billion principal amount of senior unsecured notes due 2047. The notes will be redeemed on March 17, 2020 at par as set forth in the indenture agreement. We do not expect this redemption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2019, we completed a public offering of $5.0 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes with a weighted average effective interest rate of 3.57% (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 7D. Financial Instruments: Long-Term Debt).

Domestic and International Selected Financial Assets

Many of our operations are conducted outside the U.S., and significant portions of our selected financial assets are held internationally. The amount of funds held in U.S. tax jurisdictions can fluctuate due to the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business and due to other reasons, such as business-development activities. As part of our ongoing liquidity assessments, we regularly monitor the mix of domestic and international cash flows (both inflows and outflows). The changes in tax law under the TCJA, which includes transitioning U.S. international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial tax system, will also allow us to more easily access our selected financial assets globally. The majority of our cash we held internationally as of year-end 2017 was repatriated in 2018.

Agreement to Combine Upjohn with Mylan

In connection with the recently-announced agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan discussed in the “Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review, Upjohn will incur approximately $12 billion of debt prior to the closing of the transaction. Immediately prior to the separation, Upjohn will make a cash distribution of $12 billion to Pfizer, which will be funded by the proceeds of such debt. Following the separation, Upjohn will remain the obligor with respect to the debt.

Credit Ratings

Two major corporate debt-rating organizations, Moody’s and S&P, assign ratings to our short-term and long-term debt. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and the rating is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. 

In June 2019, S&P placed Pfizer on “CreditWatch Negative” following the announcement of Pfizer’s intention to acquire Array. The CreditWatch placement was resolved with a one-notch downgrade of Pfizer’s debt rating to ‘AA-’ upon the consummation of the transaction. In July 2019, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan, which resulted in actions from both Moody’s and S&P. Moody’s placed Pfizer’s long-term rating under review for downgrade (limited to one-notch, or ‘A2’ upon close of the Mylan transaction) while S&P lowered Pfizer’s rating to ‘AA-’ (as a result of the Array transaction) and confirmed it will still remain on CreditWatch Negative (with the expectation the rating will be lowered one additional notch to ‘A+’ upon close of the Mylan transaction).

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Debt Capacity––Lines of Credit

We have available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements with a group of banks and other financial intermediaries. We typically maintain cash and cash equivalent balances and short-term investments which, together with our available revolving credit facilities, are in excess of our commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. As of December 31, 2019, we had access to a total of $15 billion in U.S. revolving credit facilities consisting of a $7 billion facility expiring in 2024 and an $8 billion facility expiring in September 2020, which may be used to support our commercial paper borrowings. In addition to the U.S. revolving credit facilities, our lenders have provided us an additional $537 million in lines of credit, of which $508 million expire within one year. Of these total lines of credit, $15.5 billion were unused on December 31, 2019. In connection with the recently-announced agreement to combine Upjohn with Mylan discussed in the “Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook––Our Business Development Initiatives” section of this Financial Review, Upjohn entered into a fully underwritten, 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility for up to $12 billion. This bridge facility is expected to terminate upon the issuance of approximately $12 billion of debt securities, loans or a combination of the two by Upjohn prior to the transaction close.

LIBOR

From time to time, we issue variable rate debt based on LIBOR, or undertake interest rate swaps that contain a variable element based on LIBOR. The U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in July 2017 that it will no longer compel banks to submit rates that are currently used to calculate LIBOR after 2021. Various governing parties, including government agencies, are working on a benchmark transition plan for LIBOR (and other interbank offered rates globally). We are monitoring their progress, and we will likely amend contracts to accommodate any replacement rate where it is not already provided. We do not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a material impact on our liquidity or financial resources. 

Global Economic Conditions––General

The global economic environment has not had, nor do we anticipate it will have, a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources. Due to our significant operating cash flows, financial assets, access to capital markets and available lines of credit and revolving credit agreements, we continue to believe that we have, and will maintain, the ability to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We monitor our liquidity position continuously in the face of evolving economic conditions.

Contractual Obligations

Payments due under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019, mature as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a) Long-term debt consists of senior unsecured notes (including fixed and floating rate, foreign currency denominated, and other notes), carried at historical proceeds, as adjusted (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Financial Instruments). Commitments under financing leases are not significant.

(b) Our calculations of expected interest payments incorporate only current period assumptions for interest rates, foreign currency translation rates and hedging strategies (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 7. Financial Instruments), and assume that interest is accrued through the maturity date or expiration of the related instrument.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(d) Includes future minimum rental commitments under non-cancelable operating leases. These amounts include an agreement we entered in April 2018 to lease space in an office building in New York City. We expect to take control of the property in 2021 and relocate our global headquarters to this new office building in 2022. Our future minimum rental commitment under this 20-year lease is approximately $1.7 billion.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(f) Represents estimated cash payments related to the TCJA repatriation tax for which we elected with the filing of our 2018 U.S. Federal Consolidated Income Tax Return to pay in annual installments over eight years through 2026 (with the next installment due in April 2020). Our obligations may vary as a result of changes in our uncertain tax positions and/or availability of attributes such as foreign tax and other credit carryforwards. For additional information, see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 5A. Tax Matters: Taxes on Income from Continuing Operations and Note 5C. Tax Matters: Deferred Taxes.

(g) Includes only income tax amounts currently payable. We are unable to predict the timing of tax settlements related to our noncurrent obligations for uncertain tax positions as tax audits can involve complex issues and the resolution of those issues may span multiple years, particularly if subject to negotiation or litigation.

The above table includes amounts for potential milestone payments under collaboration, licensing or other arrangements, if the payments are deemed reasonably likely to occur. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and/or commercialization milestones, which may span several years and which may never occur.

In 2020, we expect to spend approximately $2.4 billion on property, plant and equipment. We rely largely on operating cash flows to fund our capital investment needs. Due to our significant operating cash flows, we believe we have the ability to meet our capital investment needs and anticipate no delays to planned capital expenditures.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with a transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnification obligations generally are subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our indemnification obligations was not significant.

Certain of our co-promotion or license agreements give our licensors or partners the rights to negotiate for, or in some cases to obtain under certain financial conditions, co-promotion or other rights in specified countries with respect to certain of our products.

Share-Purchase Plans and Accelerated Share Repurchase Agreements

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements––Note 12. Equity for information on the shares of our common stock purchased and the cost of purchases under our publicly announced share-purchase plans, including our accelerated share repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2019, our remaining share-purchase authorization was approximately $5.3 billion, with no repurchases currently planned in 2020.

Dividends on Common Stock

We paid dividends on our common stock of $8.0 billion in 2019, $8.0 billion in 2018 and $7.7 billion in 2017. In December 2019, our Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2020 dividend of $0.38 per share, payable on March 6, 2020, to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 31, 2020. The first-quarter 2020 cash dividend will be our 325th consecutive quarterly dividend.

Our current and projected dividends provide a return to shareholders while maintaining sufficient capital to invest in growing our businesses. Our dividends are not restricted by debt covenants. While the dividend level remains a decision of Pfizer’s Board of Directors and will continue to be evaluated in the context of future business performance, we currently believe that we can support future annual dividend increases, barring significant unforeseen events. Pfizer also expects that immediately following the closing of the proposed transaction to combine Upjohn with Mylan, the combined dividend dollar amount received by Pfizer shareholders in the event the equity distribution is structured as a spinoff, based upon the combination of continued Pfizer ownership and an expected 0.12 shares of the new company granted for each Pfizer share, will equate to Pfizer’s dividend amount in effect immediately prior to closing.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements—Note 1B. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies: Adoption of New Accounting Standards in 2019.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards, Not Adopted as of December 31, 2019

Standard/Description Effective Date Effect on the Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters

In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on accounting for credit losses of financial instruments. The new guidance and related amendments replace the probable initial recognition threshold for incurred loss estimates in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit loss estimates. January 1, 2020. 

This standard includes our financial instruments, such as accounts receivable, and investments that are generally of high credit quality.

Previously, when credit losses were measured under GAAP, an entity generally only considered past events and current conditions in measuring the incurred loss.

The new guidance requires us to identify, analyze, document and support new methodologies for quantifying expected credit loss estimates for our financial instruments, using information such as historical experience and current economic conditions, plus the use of reasonable supportable forecast information. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued new guidance for goodwill impairment testing. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to measure goodwill impairment. Under the new guidance the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, and recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, although it cannot exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  January 1, 2020. We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued new guidance related to customers’ accounting for implementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract. The new guidance aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in such arrangements with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The new guidance can be adopted either prospectively or retrospectively. January 1, 2020.  We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2018, the FASB issued new guidance clarifying the interaction between the accounting guidance for collaboration agreements and revenue from contracts with customers. January 1, 2020.  We do not expect this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued new guidance that simplifies the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions to the guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill.  January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. We are assessing the impact of the provisions of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans and Defined Contribution Plans. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from past results and future plans and projected future results are the following:

•the outcome of R&D activities, including, without limitation, the ability to meet anticipated pre-clinical or clinical endpoints, commencement and/or completion dates for our pre-clinical or clinical trials, regulatory submission dates, regulatory approval dates and/or launch dates, as well as the possibility of unfavorable pre-clinical and clinical trial results, including the possibility of unfavorable new clinical data and further analyses of existing clinical data;

•the risk we may not be able to successfully address all of the comments received from regulatory authorities such as the FDA or the EMA, or obtain approval from regulators, which will depend on myriad factors, including such regulator making a determination as to whether a product’s benefits outweigh its known risks and a determination of the product’s efficacy; regulatory decisions impacting labeling, manufacturing processes, safety and/or other matters; and recommendations by technical or advisory committees, such as ACIP, that may impact the use of our vaccines;

•the speed with which regulatory authorizations, pricing approvals and product launches may be achieved;

•claims and concerns that may arise regarding the safety or efficacy of in-line products and product candidates, including claims and concerns that may arise from the outcome of post-approval clinical trials, which could result in the loss of marketing approval, changes in product labeling, and/or new or increased concerns about the side effects or efficacy of, a product that could affect its availability or commercial potential, such as the update to the U.S. and EU prescribing information for Xeljanz;

•the success of external business-development activities, including the ability to identify and execute on potential business development opportunities, the ability to satisfy the conditions to closing of announced transactions in the anticipated time frame or at all, the ability to realize the anticipated benefits of any such transactions, and the potential need to obtain additional equity or debt financing to pursue these opportunities, which could result in increased leverage and impact our credit ratings;

•competitive developments, including the impact on our competitive position of new product entrants, in-line branded products, generic products, private label products, biosimilars and product candidates that treat diseases and conditions similar to those treated by our in-line drugs and drug candidates;

In addition, clinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations, and, even when we view data as sufficient to support the safety and/or effectiveness of a product candidate or a new indication for an in-line product, regulatory authorities may not share our views and may require additional data or may deny approval altogether.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management’s Report

We prepared and are responsible for the financial statements that appear in our 2019 Financial Report. These financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, therefore, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates. We also accept responsibility for the preparation of other financial information that is included in this document.

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment and those criteria, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019.

The Company’s independent auditors have issued their auditors’ report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. That report appears in our 2019 Financial Report under the heading, Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.

  2019 Financial Report

Audit Committee Report

The Audit Committee reviews Pfizer’s financial reporting process on behalf of the Board of Directors. Management has the primary responsibility for the financial statements and the reporting process, including the system of internal controls.

The Committee met and held discussions with management and the independent registered public accounting firm regarding the fair and complete presentation of Pfizer’s results and the assessment of Pfizer’s internal control over financial reporting. We discussed significant accounting policies applied in Pfizer’s financial statements, as well as, when applicable, alternative accounting treatments, and critical audit matters addressed during the audit. Management represented to the Committee that the consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and the Committee reviewed and discussed the consolidated financial statements with management and the independent registered public accounting firm. The Committee discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm matters required to be discussed under applicable Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission standards.

In addition, the Committee reviewed and discussed with the independent registered public accounting firm the auditor’s independence from Pfizer and its management. As part of that review, we received the written disclosures and the letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent registered public accounting firm’s communications with the Audit Committee concerning independence, and the Committee discussed the independent registered public accounting firm’s independence from Pfizer.

We also considered whether the independent registered public accounting firm’s provision of non-audit services to Pfizer is compatible with the auditor’s independence. The Committee concluded that the independent registered public accounting firm is independent from Pfizer and its management.

As part of our responsibilities for oversight of Pfizer’s Enterprise Risk Management process, we reviewed and discussed company policies with respect to risk assessment and risk management, including discussions of individual risk areas, as well as an annual summary of the overall process.

The Committee discussed with Pfizer’s Internal Audit Department and independent registered public accounting firm the overall scope of and plans for their respective audits. The Committee meets with the Chief Internal Auditor, Chief Compliance, Quality and Risk Officer and representatives of the independent registered public accounting firm, in regular and executive sessions, to discuss the results of their examinations, the evaluations of Pfizer’s internal controls, and the overall quality of Pfizer’s financial reporting and compliance programs.

In reliance on the reviews and discussions referred to above, the Committee has recommended to the Board of Directors, and the Board has approved, that the audited financial statements be included in Pfizer’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, for filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Committee has selected, and the Board of Directors has ratified, the selection of Pfizer’s independent registered public accounting firm for 2020.
