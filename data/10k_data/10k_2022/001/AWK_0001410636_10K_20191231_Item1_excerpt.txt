PART I

ITEM 1.BUSINESS

The Company

With a history dating back to 1886, American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse, publicly-traded water and wastewater utility company in the United States, as measured by both operating revenues and population served. A holding company originally incorporated in Delaware in 1936, the Company employs approximately 6,800 professionals who provide drinking water, wastewater and other related services to approximately 15 million people in 46 states. The Company conducts the majority of its business through regulated utilities that provide water and wastewater services, collectively presented as the “Regulated Businesses.” The Company also operates market-based businesses that provide complementary services. Individually, these businesses do not meet the criteria of a reportable segment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”), and are collectively presented as the “Market-Based Businesses,” which is consistent with how management assesses the results of these businesses.

Throughout this Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” and “American Water” mean American Water Works Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries, taken together as a whole. References to “parent company” mean American Water Works Company, Inc., without its subsidiaries.

Regulated Businesses

The Company’s primary business involves the ownership of utilities that provide water and wastewater services to residential, commercial, industrial, public authority, fire service and sale for resale customers. The Company’s utilities operate in approximately 1,700 communities in 16 states in the United States, with over 3.4 million active customers in its water and wastewater networks. Services provided by the Company’s utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state utility commissions or other entities engaged in utility regulation, collectively referred to as public utility commissions (“PUCs”). Federal, state and local governments also regulate environmental, health and safety, and water quality matters. The Company reports the results of the services provided by its utilities in the Regulated Businesses segment. Operating revenues for the Regulated Businesses were $3,094 million for 2019, $2,984 million for 2018 and $2,958 million for 2017, accounting for 86%, 87% and 88%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

Presented in the table below is a geographic summary of the Regulated Businesses’ operating revenues and the number of customers the Company serves, by type of service, for and as of the year ended December 31, 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.

(b)The Company’s “Top Seven States” are determined based upon operating revenues.

(c)Includes the Company’s utilities in the following states: Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New York, Tennessee and Virginia.

Customers

The Company’s Regulated Businesses have a large and geographically diverse customer base. A customer is defined as a person, business, municipality or any other entity that purchases the Company’s water or wastewater services as of the last business day of a reporting period. One single customer may purchase the Company’s services for use by multiple individuals or businesses, such as homes, apartment complexes, businesses and governmental entities.

4
The vast majority of the Company’s regulated water customers are metered, which allows the Company to measure and bill for its customers’ water usage, typically on a monthly basis. The Company employs a variety of methods of customer meter reading to monitor consumption. These methods range from meters with mechanical registers where consumption is manually recorded by meter readers, to meters with electronic registers capable of transmitting consumption data to proximity devices or via radio frequency to mobile or fixed network data collectors. The Company’s wastewater customers are billed either a flat rate or based upon their water consumption.

Residential customers make up a substantial portion of the Company’s customer base in all of the states in which it operates. The Company also serves (i) commercial customers, such as food and beverage providers, commercial property developers and proprietors, and energy suppliers, (ii) fire service customers, where the Company supplies water through its distribution systems to public fire hydrants for firefighting purposes and to private fire customers for use in fire suppression systems in office buildings and other facilities, (iii) industrial customers, such as large-scale manufacturers, mining and production operations, (iv) public authorities, such as government buildings and other public sector facilities, including schools and universities, and (v) other utilities and community water and wastewater systems in the form of bulk contracts for the supply of water or the treatment of wastewater, for their own customers.

The following chart depicts the allocation of the Company’s Regulated Businesses’ operating revenue of $3,094 million by type, including a breakout of the total water services revenues by class of customer, for the year ended December 31, 2019:

(a)Includes water revenues from public authorities and other utilities and community water systems under bulk contracts.

(b)Includes other operating revenues consisting primarily of miscellaneous utility charges, fees and rents.

Presented in the table below is the number of water and wastewater customers the Company served by class as of December 31:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(a)Includes public authorities and other utilities and community water and wastewater systems under bulk contracts. Bulk contracts, which are accounted for as a single customer in the table above, generally result in service to multiple customers.

5
Customer growth in the Company’s Regulated Businesses is primarily from (i) adding new customers to its customer base through acquisitions of water and/or wastewater utility systems, (ii) population growth in its authorized service areas, and (iii) sale of water to other water utilities and community water systems.

Capital Investment

Excluding acquisitions, the Company plans to invest $8.2 billion over the next five years and between $18 billion and $19 billion over the next 10 years, including $1.6 billion in 2020, for capital improvements to its Regulated Businesses’ water and wastewater infrastructure, largely for pipe replacement and upgrading aging water and wastewater treatment facilities. The Company has proactively improved its pipe renewal rate from a 250-year replacement cycle in 2009 to an expected 115-year replacement cycle by 2024, which it anticipates will enable the Company to replace nearly 2,000 miles of mains and collection pipes between 2020 and 2024. In addition, from 2020 to 2024, the Company’s capital investment in treatment plants, storage tanks and other key, above-ground facilities is expected to increase, further addressing infrastructure renewal, resiliency, water quality, operational efficiency, technology and innovation, and emerging regulatory compliance needs. Additionally, the Company is investing significantly in resiliency projects to address the impacts of climate and weather variability by hardening its assets. Recently completed projects include the $25 million raised floodwall project at New Jersey’s Raritan Millstone Water Treatment Plant which provides protection against a 500 year flood, and the $15 million Bel Air, Maryland Reservoir project which provides 90 million gallons of drought mitigation water storage for the region. 

Regulation and Rate Making

The operations of the Company’s Regulated Businesses are generally subject to regulation by PUCs in the states in which they operate, with the primary responsibility of the PUCs to promote the overall public interest by balancing the interest of customers and utility investors. Specific authority might differ from state to state, but in most states, PUCs review and approve rates charged to customers, accounting treatments, long-term financing programs and cost of capital, operation and maintenance (“O&M”) expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, affiliated transactions and relationships, reorganizations and mergers and acquisitions, along with imposing certain penalties or granting certain incentives. Regulatory policies vary from state to state and could potentially change over time. These policies will affect the timing, as well as the extent, of recovery of expenses and the realized return on invested capital.

Periodic changes in customer rates generally occur through the filing of a rate case by the utility with the PUC. The timing of rate case filings is typically determined by either periodic requirements in the regulatory jurisdiction or by the utility’s need to increase its revenue requirement to recover capital investment costs, changes in operating revenues, operating costs or other market conditions. The Company attempts to minimize “regulatory lag,” which is the time between the occurrence of an event that triggers a change in the utility’s revenue requirement and its recognition in rates.

6
The Company’s Regulated Businesses support regulatory practices at the PUCs and state legislatures that mitigate the adverse impact of regulatory lag. Presented in the table below are examples of approved regulatory practices:

Regulatory Practices Description States Allowed

Infrastructure replacement surcharges Allows rates to change periodically, outside a general rate case proceeding, to reflect recovery of capital investments made to replace infrastructure necessary to sustain safe, reliable services for the Company’s customers. These mechanisms typically involve periodic filings and reviews to ensure transparency. IA, IL, IN, KY, MO, NJ, NY, PA, TN, VA, WV

Future test year A test period used for setting rates, which begins with the date new rates are effective. This allows current or projected revenues, expenses and capital investments to be collected on a more timely basis. CA, HI, IA, IL, IN, KY, NY, PA, TN, VA

Hybrid test year Allows an update to historical data for “known and measurable” changes that occur subsequent to the historical test year. MD, MO, NJ, WV

Utility plant recovery mechanisms Allows recovery of the full return on utility plant costs during the construction period, instead of capitalizing an allowance for funds used during construction. In addition, some states allow the utility to seek pre-approval of certain capital projects and associated costs. In this pre-approval process, the PUC may assess the prudency of such projects. CA, IL, KY, NY, PA, TN, VA

Expense mechanisms Allows changes in certain operating expenses, which may fluctuate based on conditions beyond the utility’s control, to be recovered outside of a general rate case proceeding or deferred until the next general rate case proceeding. CA, IL, MD, MO, NJ, NY, PA, TN, VA

Revenue stability mechanisms Separates a utility’s cost recovery from the amount of water it sells to recover its fixed costs and ongoing infrastructure investment needs. Such a mechanism adjusts rates periodically to ensure that a utility’s revenue will be sufficient to cover its costs, regardless of sales volume, including recognition of declining sales resulting from reduced consumption, while providing an incentive for customers to use water more efficiently. CA, IL, NY

Consolidated tariffs Use of a unified rate structure for water systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. The consolidated tariff pricing structure may be used fully or partially in a state, and is generally used to prioritize capital investments and moderate the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs, while lowering administrative costs for customers. Pennsylvania also permits a blending of water and wastewater revenue requirements. CA, IA, IL, IN, KY, MD, MO, NJ, NY, PA, VA, WV

The Company pursues enhancement to these regulatory practices to facilitate efficient recovery of its costs and capital investments in order to continue to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to its customers. The ability to seek regulatory treatment as described above does not guarantee that the PUCs will accept the Company’s proposal in the context of a particular rate case, and these regulatory practices may reduce, but not eliminate, regulatory lag associated with traditional rate making processes. It is also the Company’s strategy to expand the use of these mechanisms in areas where they may not currently apply.

Acquisitions and Strategic Growth

The U.S. water and wastewater industries include investor-owned systems as well as municipal systems that are owned and operated by local governments or governmental subdivisions. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), as of 2017, approximately 84% of the water market is served by municipal systems and approximately 98% of the country’s wastewater systems are government owned. The EPA also estimates that there are approximately 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States, with approximately 80% of the community water systems serving a population of 3,000 or less.

A fundamental aspect of the Company’s growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions of small and medium water and/or wastewater systems in geographic proximity to areas where the Company operates its Regulated Businesses. The proximity of acquisition opportunities to the Company’s regulated footprint allows it to integrate and manage the acquired systems and operations primarily using its existing management, although the Company typically retains the majority, if not all, of the employees, and to achieve operational efficiencies and prioritize capital investment needs. The Company’s current customer mix of 93% water and 7% wastewater also presents strategic opportunities for wastewater growth and systems consolidation, allowing it to add wastewater customers where the Company already serves water customers. The Company intends to continue to expand its regulated footprint geographically by acquiring water and wastewater systems in its existing markets and, if appropriate, pursuing acquisition opportunities in certain domestic markets where the Company does not currently operate its Regulated Businesses. Before entering new regulated markets, the Company will evaluate the business and regulatory climates to ensure that it will have the opportunity to achieve an appropriate rate of return on its investment while maintaining its high standards for providing safe, reliable and affordable services to its customers, as well as a line of sight to grow the Company’s base customers to attain efficiencies after entering the new domestic market.

Increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations, the amount of infrastructure in need of significant capital investment, financial challenges and industry legislation are several elements that may drive more municipalities to consider selling their water and wastewater assets.

7
Industry Legislation

In 2017, New Jersey enacted the Water Quality Accountability Act (the “WQAA”), which sets operational standards for all water utilities in New Jersey, including municipal and investor-owned utilities with more than 500 service connections. This law imposes requirements in areas such as cybersecurity, asset management, water quality reporting, remediation of notices of violation, and hydrant and valve maintenance. The WQAA requires the most senior water manager, or either the executive director for municipal utility authorities or the mayor or chief executive officer for municipally owned public water systems, to certify that the system meets the requirements under the WQAA. In 2019, the New Jersey Senate held three hearings on the WQAA and is expected to introduce legislation in the new 2020 legislative session that would strengthen accountability for obligations under the WQAA.

In 2018, similar legislation was passed in Indiana that set new operational requirements for water and wastewater treatment plants as part of the permitting process for construction, installation, or modification of sources, facilities, equipment or devices. These requirements include capital asset management plans that include annual reviews of infrastructure needs, engineering analysis of useful life, and a rate analysis to support the capital asset management plan. A life cycle cost-benefit analysis must be done comparing owning and operating a plant to other alternatives to supply water or wastewater services. Cybersecurity plans must also be developed. In 2019, additional legislation was passed which set requirements for access to loans or grants such as participation in regional planning events, use of current capital asset management programs, and elimination of the causes of non-revenue water. The finance authority was also required to establish project prioritization that included consideration of project effects on public health and safety, user rates and charges, plans for collaboration, plans to manage non-revenue water and use of best practices.

Also, in 2018, America’s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018 was signed into law. The legislation includes policies intended to improve water and wastewater system management and authorization for states to assess consolidation options for systems that do not comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and its rules and regulations. The legislation increases funding to water system funding programs, including the State Revolving Loan Fund program and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (“WIFIA”).

The Company’s regulated subsidiaries in California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have access to fair market value legislation for private sector investment in public sector water and wastewater systems. The Company supports full optionality for municipalities, including state legislation that enables the consolidation of the largely fragmented water and wastewater industries through third-party fair market valuations of purchased property. Fair market value assessment of water and wastewater systems is an alternative to the traditional depreciated original cost method of valuation, providing municipalities with a purchase price that is reflective of the assets’ market value, while the utility has increased assurance of recovering the purchase price over the life of the assets, subject to state regulatory commission approval.

Consolidated tariffs use a unified rate structure for systems owned and operated by a single utility, which may or may not be physically interconnected. Consolidated tariff pricing moderates the impact of periodic fluctuations in local costs and promotes a more universal water infrastructure investment in the state. As a result, consolidated tariffs can make it easier to incorporate new systems into an existing utility and can ensure economies of scale for even the smallest of systems and prioritize capital needs across the state. Overall, this brings cost-effective, higher quality services to a larger number of citizens. Twelve of the Company’s regulated jurisdictions currently have some form of consolidated tariff pricing, including California, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia.

In 2018, legislation was enacted in the Company’s Missouri and California subsidiaries changing the public vote requirement for the sale of water or wastewater systems. In Missouri, the public vote requirement for the sale of a municipal water or wastewater system changed to a simple majority for more than 500 small towns. Historically, only larger communities required a simple majority, while smaller communities needed a two-thirds majority. This legislation increases the options for small towns, should they decide to address their water and sewer challenges through an asset sale. In California, the vote required to allow cities to sell sewer systems changed to a simple majority from a two-thirds majority.

Competition

The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally do not face direct competition in their existing markets because (i) the Company operates in those markets pursuant to franchises, charters, certificates of public convenience and necessity or similar authorizations (collectively, “CPCNs”) issued by state PUCs or other authorities, and (ii) the high cost of constructing a new water and wastewater system in an existing market creates a significant barrier to market entry. However, the Company’s Regulated Businesses do face competition from governmental agencies, other investor-owned utilities, large industrial customers with the ability to provide their own water supply/treatment process and strategic buyers that are entering new markets and/or making strategic acquisitions. When pursuing acquisitions, the Company’s largest investor-owned competitors, based on a comparison of operating revenues and population served, are Essential Utilities, Inc. (formerly known as Aqua America, Inc.), Suez North America, American States Water Company and California Water Service Group. From time to time, the Company also faces competition from infrastructure funds, multi-utility companies and others, such as Algonquin Power and Utilities Corp., Eversource Energy and Corix.

8
Condemnation and Eminent Domain

All or portions of the Regulated Businesses’ utility assets could be acquired by state, municipal or other government entities through one or more of the following methods: (i) eminent domain (also known as condemnation); (ii) the right of purchase given or reserved by a municipality or political subdivision when the original CPCN was granted; and (iii) the right of purchase given or reserved under the law of the state in which the utility subsidiary was incorporated or from which it received its CPCN. The acquisition consideration related to such a proceeding initiated by a local government may be determined consistent with applicable eminent domain law, or may be negotiated or fixed by appraisers as prescribed by the law of the state or in the particular CPCN.

As such, the Regulated Businesses are periodically subject to condemnation proceedings in the ordinary course of business. For example, a citizens group in Monterey, California successfully added “Measure J” to the November 2018 election ballot asking voters to decide whether the Monterey Peninsula Water Management District (the “MPWMD”) should conduct a feasibility study concerning the potential purchase of the Monterey water service system assets (the “Monterey system assets”) of the Company’s California subsidiary, and, if feasible, to proceed with a purchase of those assets without an additional public vote. This service territory represents approximately 40,000 customers. In November 2018, Measure J was certified to have passed. 

On August 19, 2019, the MPWMD’s General Manager issued a report that recommends that the MPWMD board (1) develop criteria to determine which water systems should be considered for acquisition, (2) examine the feasibility of acquiring the Monterey system assets and consider public ownership of smaller systems only if the MPWMD becomes the owner of a larger system, (3) evaluate whether it is in the public interest to acquire the Monterey system assets and sufficiently satisfy the criterion of “feasible” as provided in Measure J, (4) ensure there is significant potential for cost savings before agreeing to commence an acquisition, and (5) develop more fully alternate operating plans before deciding whether to consider a Resolution of Necessity.

On November 6, 2019, the MPWMD issued a preliminary valuation and cost of service analysis report, finding in part that (1) an estimate of the Monterey system assets’ total value plus adjustments would be approximately $513 million, (2) the cost of service modeling results indicate significant annual reductions in revenue requirements and projected monthly water bills, and (3) the acquisition of the Monterey system assets by the MPWMD would be economically feasible. The MPWMD will hold public hearings regarding the findings contained in this preliminary report. If the MPWMD were to make a final determination that an acquisition of the Monterey system assets is feasible, then the MPWMD would commence a multi-year eminent domain proceeding against the Company’s California subsidiary to first establish the MPWMD’s right to take the Monterey system assets and, if such right is established, to determine the amount of just compensation to be paid to the California subsidiary for such assets.

Also, five municipalities in the Chicago, Illinois area (approximately 30,300 customers in total) formed a water agency and filed an eminent domain lawsuit against the Company’s Illinois subsidiary in January 2013, seeking to condemn the water pipeline that serves those five municipalities. Before filing its eminent domain lawsuit, the water agency made an offer of $38 million for the pipeline. A jury trial will take place to establish the value of the pipeline. The parties have filed with the court updated valuation reports. Although the date of the valuation trial has not currently been scheduled, it is not likely to commence before the second quarter of 2020.

Furthermore, the law in certain jurisdictions in which the Regulated Businesses operate provides for eminent domain rights allowing private property owners to file a lawsuit to seek just compensation against a public utility, if a public utility’s infrastructure has been determined to be a substantial cause of damage to that property. In these actions, the plaintiff would not have to prove that the public utility acted negligently. In California, lawsuits have been filed in connection with large-scale natural events such as wildfires. Some have included allegations that infrastructure of certain utilities triggered the natural event that resulted in damage to the property. In some cases, the PUC has allowed certain costs or losses incurred by the utility to be recovered from customers in rates, but in other cases such recovery in rates has been disallowed. Also, the utility may have obtained insurance that could respond to some or all of such losses, although the utility would be at risk for any losses not ultimately subject to rate or insurance recovery or losses that exceed the limits of such insurance.

Water Supply and Wastewater Services

The Company’s Regulated Businesses generally own the physical assets used to store, pump, treat and deliver water to its customers and collect, treat, transport and recycle wastewater. Typically, the Company does not own the water, which is held in public trust and is allocated to the Company through contracts, permits and allocation rights granted by federal and state or multi-state agencies or through the ownership of water rights pursuant to local law. The Company is dependent on defined sources of water supply and obtains its water supply from surface water sources such as reservoirs, lakes, rivers and streams; from groundwater sources, such as wells and aquifers; and water purchased from third-party water suppliers. The level of water treatment the Company applies varies significantly depending upon the quality of the water source and customer stipulations. Surface water sources typically generally require significant treatment, while groundwater sources often require chemical treatment only.

9
Presented in the chart below are the Company’s sources of water supply as of December 31, 2019:

Presented in the table below are the percentages of water supply by source type for the Company’s top seven states for 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company’s ability to meet the existing and future water demands of its customers depends on an adequate water supply. Drought, governmental restrictions, overuse of sources of water, the protection of threatened species or habitats, contamination or other factors may limit the availability of ground and surface water. The Company employs a variety of measures in an effort to obtain adequate sources of water supply, both in the short-term and over the long-term. The geographic diversity of the Company’s service areas may mitigate some of the economic effects on the water supply associated with weather extremes it might encounter in any particular service territory. For example, in any given summer, some areas may experience drier than average weather, which may reduce the amount of source water available, while other areas the Company serves may experience wetter than average weather.

10
The Company evaluates quality, quantity, growth needs and alternate sources of water supply as well as transmission and distribution capacity. Water supply is seasonal in nature and weather conditions can have a pronounced effect on supply. In order to ensure that the Company has adequate water supply, it uses long-term planning processes and maintains contingency plans to minimize the potential impact on service caused by climate variability and a wide range of weather fluctuations. In connection with supply planning for most surface or groundwater sources, the Company employs models to determine safe yields under different rainfall and drought conditions. Surface and ground water levels are routinely monitored so that supply capacity deficits may, to the extent possible, be predicted and mitigated through demand management and additional supply development. An example of the Company’s use of long-term planning to ensure that it has adequate water supply is its involvement in the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project (the “Water Supply Project”) in California. The Water Supply Project includes the construction of a desalination plant, owned by the Company’s California subsidiary, and the construction of wells that would supply water to the desalination plant. In addition, the Water Supply Project also includes the California subsidiary’s purchase of water from a groundwater replenishment project (the “GWR Project”) between Monterey One Water (formerly known as the Monterey Regional Water Pollution Control Agency) and the MPWMD. The Water Supply Project is intended, among other things, to fulfill obligations of the California subsidiary to eliminate unauthorized diversions from the Carmel River as required under orders of the California State Water Resources Control Board (the “SWRCB”). For more information, see Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Alternative Water Supply in Lieu of Carmel River Diversions.

Wastewater services involve the collection of wastewater from customers’ premises through sewer lines. The wastewater is then transported through a sewer network to a treatment facility, where it is treated to meet required regulatory standards for wastewater before being returned to the environment. The solid waste by-product of the treatment process is disposed of or recycled in accordance with applicable standards and regulations.

Seasonality

Customer demand for the Company’s water service is affected by weather and tends to vary with temperature and amount and frequency of rainfall. Customer demand is generally greater during the warmer months, primarily due to increased water usage for irrigation systems and other outdoor water use. As such, the Company typically expects its operating revenues to be the highest in the third quarter of each year. Weather that is hotter and/or drier than average generally increases operating revenues, whereas, weather that is cooler and/or wetter than average generally serves to suppress customer water demand and can reduce water operating revenues. Three of the Company’s jurisdictions, California, Illinois and New York, have adopted revenue stability mechanisms which permit the Company to collect state PUC-authorized revenue for a given period which is not tied to the volume of water sold during that period, thereby lessening the impact of weather variability. See “Regulation and Rate Making” for additional information regarding revenue stability mechanisms.

Market-Based Businesses

The Company’s Market-Based Businesses provide complementary home services primarily to residential and smaller commercial customers and water and wastewater services to the U.S. government on military installations, as well as municipalities, utilities and industrial customers. These businesses are not subject to regulation by state PUCs and the services provided generally do not require significant capital investment. Operating revenues for the Company’s Market-Based Businesses were $539 million for 2019, $476 million for 2018 and $422 million for 2017, accounting for 15%, 14% and 13%, respectively, of the Company’s total operating revenues for the same periods.

The Company’s primary Market-Based Businesses include the following operating segments:

•Homeowner Services Group (“HOS”), which provides various warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers;

•Military Services Group (“MSG”), which enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on various military installations.

The Company also has five contracts with municipal customers to operate and manage water and wastewater facilities and provide other related services through its Contract Services Group (“CSG”). 

Previously, the Company provided customized water transfer services for shale natural gas exploration and production companies through its Keystone Clearwater Solutions, LLC (“Keystone”) operations. On December 12, 2019, as part of a strategic review undertaken by the Company, the Company sold all of its interest in Keystone to a natural gas and oil industry investment group. See Note 4—Acquisitions and Divestitures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

11
Homeowner Services Group

The Company’s Homeowner Services Group, which includes the operations of Pivotal Home Solutions (“Pivotal”) acquired in June 2018, provides warranty protection programs and other home services to residential customers for interior and exterior water and sewer lines, interior gas and electric lines, heating and cooling systems, water heaters and other home appliances, as well as power surge protection and other related services. The Company develops partnerships with municipalities, utilities and other organizations to offer protection programs to customers serviced by, or affiliated with, those municipalities, utilities and organizations. The term of these partnership agreements with the municipalities, utilities and other organizations is typically three to five years, with mutual optional renewals. As of December 31, 2019, HOS had approximately 3 million customer contracts in 43 states.

Military Services Group

The Company’s Military Services Group operates on 16 military installations under 50-year contracts with the U.S. government as part of its Utility Privatization Program. The scope of these contracts generally includes the operation and maintenance of the installation’s water and wastewater systems and a capital program focused on asset replacement and, in certain instances, systems expansion. The replacement of assets assumed when a contract is awarded to the Company is completed either through a discrete set of projects executed in the first five years of the contract or through the long term recapitalization program performed over the life of the contract. Traditionally, both of these programs are funded from the contract fee. At times, new assets are required to support the installation’s mission and the construction of these assets are funded by the U.S. government as separate modifications or amendments to the contract. The capital program historically has not used the Company’s equity or debt borrowings; rather, the Company has used limited working capital for short-term needs under these contracts. In April 2018, the U.S. Army instituted a requirement that a bidder must offer financing in its proposal for these new capital projects. However, the U.S. Army’s implementation of this requirement has limited the need for financing of these projects and the Company has been awarded several projects without any requirement to provide financing.

The contract price for nine of the Company’s contracts with the U.S. government is subject to redetermination two years after commencement of operations, and every three years thereafter. Price redetermination is a contract mechanism to periodically adjust the service fee in the next period, to reflect changes in contract obligations and anticipated market conditions. The remaining seven contracts with the U.S. government are subject to annual price adjustments under a mechanism similar to price redetermination called “Economic Price Adjustment.” All of these contracts could be terminated, in whole or in part, prior to the end of the 50-year term for convenience of the U.S. government, or as a result of default or non-performance by the subsidiary performing the contract. In either event, pursuant to termination provisions applicable to all of these contracts, the Company would be entitled to recover allowable costs that it may have incurred under the contract, plus the contract profit margin on incurred costs. The Company’s backlog of revenue associated with its contracts with the U.S. government is approximately $5.4 billion, with an average remaining contract term of 42 years.

Competition

The Company’s Market-Based Businesses face competition from a number of service providers, including HomeServe USA and Cinch Home Services in HOS, and American States Water Company, Suez North America, and Veolia Environnement S.A. in MSG.

Environmental, Health and Safety, Water Quality and Other Regulation

The Company’s water and wastewater operations, including the services provided by both its Regulated Businesses and Market-Based Businesses, are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, health and safety, the provision of water and wastewater services, particularly with respect to the quality of water the Company delivers to its customers, and the manner in which it collects, treats, discharges, recycles and disposes of wastewater. In the United States, these regulations are developed under legislation including the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act and the Clean Water Act. Environmental, health and safety, and water quality regulations are complex and may vary from state to state in those instances where a state has adopted a standard that is more stringent than the Federal standard. For example, while the EPA has issued a non-enforceable Health Advisory for the combined level of two perfluorinated compounds (perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, and perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS), the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is developing drinking water standards for these two compounds and has adopted a standard for a third compound, perfluorononanoic acid, or PFNA, as well as other perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The Company is also subject to various federal, state, local laws and regulations governing the storage of hazardous materials, the management and disposal of hazardous and solid wastes, discharges to air and water, the cleanup of contaminated sites, dam safety and other matters relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety. PUCs also set conditions and standards for the water and wastewater services the Company delivers.

12
The Company maintains an environmental program that includes responsible business practices, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and effective use of natural resources, which is important given the overall trend that drinking water standards have become increasingly more stringent over time. As newer or stricter standards are introduced, the Company’s capital and operating costs could increase. The Company incurs substantial costs associated with compliance with the environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards to which its operations are subject and the Company invests in technology solutions for enhanced detection and monitoring. The Company estimates that it will make capital expenditures of approximately $600 million over the next five years for environmental control facilities, which the Company defines for this purpose as any project (or portion thereof) that involves the preservation of air, water or land. The Company believes that its operations are materially in compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable environmental laws and regulations.

The Company’s operations also involve the use, storage and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. For example, the Company’s water and wastewater treatment facilities store and use chlorine and other chemicals that generate wastes that require proper handling and disposal under applicable environmental requirements. The Company also could incur remedial costs in connection with any contamination relating to its operations or facilities or its off-site disposal of wastes. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), authorizes the EPA, and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities, to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances. Parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites, as well as current and former owners and operators of such sites, may be deemed liable, without regard to fault, under CERCLA or comparable state laws. Although the Company is not aware of any material cleanup or decontamination obligations, the discovery of contamination or the imposition of such obligations in the future could result in additional costs. The Company’s facilities and operations are also subject to requirements under the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act and inspections thereunder. Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries are involved in pending legal proceedings relating to environmental matters. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for additional information.

Safe Drinking Water Act

The Safe Drinking Water Act and related regulations establish national quality standards for drinking water. The EPA has issued rules governing the levels of numerous, naturally occurring and man-made chemical and microbial contaminants and radionuclides allowable in drinking water, and continues to propose new rules. These rules also prescribe testing requirements for detecting regulated contaminants, the treatment systems that may be used for removing those contaminants, and other requirements. To date, the EPA has set standards for approximately 90 contaminants and indicators for drinking water, and there is a process in place to make a regulatory determination on at least five additional compounds every five years.

To help formulate the basis for future regulations, the EPA has the authority to require monitoring for additional, unregulated contaminants under the Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (the “Monitoring Rule”). The Company’s facilities have participated in the data gathering effort for the Monitoring Rule in previous rounds, which occurs every five years, and are also a participant in the ongoing fourth round, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2020. There are millions of other chemical compounds that are not regulated, many of which are lacking a testing methodology, occurrence data, health effects information and/or treatment technology. The process of developing new drinking water standards is long and complex, but the Company actively participates with the EPA and other water industry groups by sharing research and water quality operational knowledge. See “Research and Development—Emerging Containments” for additional information.

To effect the removal or inactivation of microbial organisms, the EPA has established various rules to improve the disinfection and filtration of drinking water and to reduce consumers’ exposure to disinfectants and by-products of the disinfection process. In 2006, the EPA issued the Long-Term 2 Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule and the Stage 2 Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproduct Rule and finalized the Ground Water Rule, which is applicable to systems providing water from underground sources. In 2016, the revised Total Coliform Rule implemented a “find and fix” process where exceeding bacterial trigger levels requires an assessment to correct any sanitary defects. The Company is within the EPA’s time frame for compliance with these standards, which includes sample collection, data analysis, engineering planning and system implementation. Recent monitoring under the Long-Term 2 Rule has resulted in the need for more than 30 of the Company’s surface water systems to provide additional protection against cryptosporidium. In many cases, this will involve installing UV disinfection, and although several plants have already completed assessments and upgrades, an estimated $150 million to $250 million of investment will still be required for the remaining facilities. Further, the EPA is actively considering regulations for a number of contaminants, including strontium, hexavalent chromium, fluoride, nitrosamines, perchlorate, some pharmaceuticals and certain volatile organic compounds. The Company does not anticipate that any such regulations, if enacted, will require implementation in 2020.

13
The Company conducts over one million water quality tests each year at its laboratory facilities and plant operations, including continuous online instrumentations such as monitoring turbidity levels, disinfectant residuals and adjustments to chemical treatment based on changes in incoming water. The Company participates in the Partnership for Safe Water, the EPA’s voluntary program to meet more stringent goals for reducing microbial contaminants. With 69 of the Company’s 80 surface water treatment plants receiving the EPA program’s prestigious “Director” award, which recognizes utilities that (i) have completed a comprehensive self-assessment report, (ii) created an action plan for continuous improvement, and (iii) produced high-quality drinking water, the Company accounts for approximately one-third of the plants receiving such awards nationwide. In addition, 67 of the Company’s surface water treatment plants have received the “Five-Year Phase III” award, 62 plants have received the “Ten-Year Phase III” award, 58 plants have received the “Fifteen-Year Phase III” award, and three plants have received the “Twenty-Year Phase III” award; these awards recognize plants that have met the Director award status for five, 10, 15 and 20 years, respectively. Further, nine of the Company’s surface water plants have received the “Presidents” award, which recognizes treatment plants that achieve the Partnership’s rigorous individual filter effluent turbidity standards.

Although it is difficult to project the ultimate costs of complying with the above or other pending or future requirements, the Company expects current requirements under the Safe Drinking Water Act and other similar laws to be recoverable through the regulatory process and therefore compliance costs are not expected to have a material impact on its operations or financial condition. In addition, capital expenditures and operating costs to comply with environmental mandates have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates. As a result, the Company expects to recover the operating and capital costs resulting from these pending or future requirements.

Lead and Copper Rule and Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act

In 1991, the EPA published the Lead and Copper Rule (“LCR”) to control lead and copper in drinking water and, since that time, has issued minor revisions in 2000, 2004 and 2007, enhancing monitoring, reporting and public education requirements. In 2011, Congress enacted the Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act regarding the use and introduction into commerce of lead pipes, plumbing fittings for fixtures, solder and flux. While these advances have made an impact in reducing lead exposure in drinking water, legacy lead plumbing materials, primarily in building plumbing, still remain in many communities. The failure of certain water systems in the United States to comply with the requirements of the LCR has received recent media attention and scrutiny, and in certain cases, has led to a number of investigations and the imposition of significant penalties and sanctions against the operators of those systems and others. As part of its ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects, the Company has started to replace LSLs in accordance with current scientific guidance. Also, the Company utilizes appropriate corrosion control techniques as necessary to comply with current water quality regulatory requirements. The EPA proposed revisions to the LCR in November 2019 designed to provide more effective protection of public health by reducing exposure to lead and copper in drinking water. The Company continues to review the implications of the LCR and comments on the proposed revisions to the rule were due to the EPA by February 12, 2020. The Company will develop an implementation strategy to comply with the new requirements, if and when adopted, prior to the compliance effective dates in the final rule. Capital expenditures and operating costs associated with compliance with any of these rule revisions cannot be determined until the final rule is promulgated, but costs associated with compliance with federal regulations have been traditionally recognized by PUCs as appropriate for inclusion in establishing rates.

The Company currently estimates that approximately 5% of the service lines within its regulated service territories contain lead on either the Company or customer portion of the service line (“LSLs”). The Company is replacing LSLs as part of ongoing water main replacement and service line renewal projects. The Company’s goal is to work with the communities it currently serves to replace a significant majority of presently known LSLs in most service areas by the end of 2030, at an estimated cost ranging from $600 million to $1.2 billion. The Company believes this will be attainable for most service areas where public policy is supportive of this goal. With regard to future acquisitions, the Company will work with those communities as part of the acquisition process to set LSL removal goals appropriate for those systems. The prioritization of LSL removal plan is dependent on several factors, including the Company’s planned water main and service line renewal projects, adjacent projects by municipalities or other utilities, LCR compliance monitoring results, and cooperation with its customers with respect to replacing the customer-owned portion of the LSL as necessary. In certain cases these factors may result in a shorter or longer time frame for replacement. Because replacing the external LSL in its entirety is advised by several water industry organizations including the U.S. National Drinking Water Advisory Council, the Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative, and the American Water Works Association, the Company’s preferred approach is to replace the entire external LSL if lead is found on either the Company or customer portion of the service line. The Lead Service Line Replacement Collaborative is a diverse group of public health, water utility, environmental, labor, consumer and housing organizations from across the country working together to encourage communities to accelerate the full replacement of LSLs through collaborative efforts at the local level.

Clean Water Act

The Clean Water Act regulates discharges from drinking water and wastewater treatment facilities into lakes, rivers, streams and groundwater. In addition to requirements applicable to the Company’s wastewater collection systems, its operations require discharge permits under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit program established under the Clean Water Act, which must be renewed every five years. Pursuant to the NPDES permit program, the EPA and implementing states set maximum discharge limits for wastewater effluents and overflows from wastewater collection systems. Discharges that exceed the limits specified under NPDES permits can lead to the imposition of fines and penalties, and persistent non-compliance could lead to significant fines and penalties and other compliance costs. In addition, the difficulty of obtaining and complying with NPDES permits, and renewing expiring permits, may impose time and cost burdens on the Company’s operations. From time to time, discharge violations occur at the Company’s facilities, some of which result in fines. The Company does not expect any such violations or fines to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental, Social Responsibility and Governance

The Company considers environmental, social responsibility and governance (“ESG”) to include: environmental leadership and sustainability; operational excellence; employee engagement, safety and equality; active community engagement, civic and charitable involvement; and transparency and good governance. Integration of these principles into the Company’s daily operations emphasizes its belief that “how” a company operates is just as important as “what” a company does.

This focus is derived from the Company’s vision statement, “clean water for life,” and its core values: (i) safety; (ii) trust; (iii) environmental leadership; (iv) teamwork; and (v) high performance, which are the principles by which it operates. The Company’s vision and values drive its company strategy, which is centered on five central themes:

•Safety—The safety of the Company’s employees and its customers is the number one focus for American Water.

•Customers—The Company’s customers are at the center of everything it does, helping the Company to shape its strategic priorities. The Company challenges itself so that if its regulated utility customers were to have a choice of providers, the Company would want them to choose American Water.

•People—Maintaining an environment which is open, transparent, diverse and inclusive, and where the Company’s people feel valued, included and accountable, is critical to the Company’s ability to serve its customers every day.

•Operational Excellence—The Company’s operational excellence strategy helps it to find better and more efficient ways to do business, and to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for its customers.

•Growth—The Company believes that when companies grow, they can invest more in creating stable jobs, training, benefits, infrastructure and their communities. The Company’s growth benefits all of its stakeholders, including its shareholders.

In 2019, the Company issued its fifth biennial Sustainability Report, covering its sustainability performance for calendar years 2018 and 2017. This report can be accessed on the Company’s website, https://amwater.com, and was prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core Option, as well as standards from the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and Edison Electric Institute. The Company’s first report was issued in 2011, making American Water the first large water services company to measure its performance against the Global Reporting Index. In addition, the Company’s sustainability practices have supported its inclusion in the Euronext Vigeo® U.S. 50 index, FTSE4Good index series, 2018 NAACP Equity Inclusion and Empowerment Index, 2019 Constituent MSCI ESG Leaders Indexes, 2020 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, and ranked 16th on the Corporate Knights’ 2020 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World.

Research and Development

The Company’s Research and Development Program

The Company maintains an industry-leading Research and Development (“R&D”) program that is designed to enhance its services, help ensure compliance, improve quality and operational effectiveness, and provide environmental leadership. For more than three decades from its inception, American Water’s R&D program has evolved into an industry leading effort and has achieved numerous advancements in the science of drinking water, wastewater, and desalination. Through laboratory and industry resources and the team’s expertise, efforts are focused on contaminants of emerging concern, including but not limited to PFAS, Legionella, cyanotoxin-forming algal blooms, pathogens and disinfection byproducts. The Company’s R&D personnel are located at the Company’s corporate headquarters and at two laboratory testing facilities in New Jersey and Illinois, the latter housing its quality control and testing laboratory, which supports the Company’s R&D activities through testing and analysis.

The Company continues to leverage its expertise and collaborate with the EPA and state agencies to help establish effective environmental, health and safety, and water quality standards and regulation. This relationship includes the sharing of the Company’s research, such as its treatment and distribution system optimization research and its national water quality monitoring data. The Company’s engagement with the EPA provides it with early insight into emerging regulatory issues and initiatives, thereby allowing the Company to anticipate and to accommodate its future compliance requirements. The Company also frequently engages with the Centers for Disease Control, other state environmental agencies, and national and international water research foundations. The Company believes that continued R&D activities are critical for providing safe, reliable and affordable services, as well as maintaining its leadership position in the industry, which provides the Company with a competitive advantage as it seeks additional business with new and existing customers.

Emerging Contaminants

Emerging contaminants include numerous chemicals such as pharmaceuticals, personal care products, pesticides, herbicides and endocrine disrupting compounds, as well as some naturally occurring microbes, such as bacteria, viruses and parasites, which have been detected in drinking water supplies, for which the risk to the public’s health is not fully understood and/or has not been quantified. While these contaminants have been present in drinking water for as long as they have been in use, technological advances have only recently made it possible to detect many of them. The ability to detect contaminants, even at trace levels, has raised questions among regulators and government agencies, further affecting the public’s perception of drinking water quality.

The Chemicals Abstract Service Registry contains over 159 million registered chemicals, with an estimated 1,400 species of disease-causing microbes that can affect humans. The Company is continually investigating new substances and contaminants, employing a team of scientists, engineers and public health professionals to identify threats to its water supply, to act on emerging regulations and new health advisories, and to evaluate the benefits of alternative or advanced treatment technologies. The Company maintains state-of-the-art water quality testing equipment and implements new and emerging technologies to help predict and manage potential water supply contamination issues. Examples of the Company’s efforts include:

•using its research findings to communicate information to its customers on the actions they can take to manage Legionella (the Centers for Disease Control statistics indicate that water-associated disease from Legionella is on the rise, with exposure typically associated with customer-owned plumbing systems in large buildings);

•aerial drone testing to detect harmful algal blooms and testing ultrasonic technology to help prevent taste and odor events and to eliminate cyanotoxins before they get to the water treatment plant;

•the implementation of water source assessment tools, including sensors and analytics, to evaluate and track chemical storage and aid in the detection of source water contamination events;

•development of methodology and measurement techniques for emerging contaminants to investigate transport, occurrence and treatment; and

•the implementation of activated carbon, biofiltration and ion exchange for the control of emerging contaminants.
