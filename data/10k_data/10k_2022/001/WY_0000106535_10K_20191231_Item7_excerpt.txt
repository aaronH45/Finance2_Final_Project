For Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) related to the year ended December 31, 2017, refer to this same section (Part II, Item 7) in our 2018 annual report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 15, 2019. 

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS 

The demand for grade sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by production levels of domestic wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board as well as the demand for biofuels, such as pellets made from pulpwood. 

Housing starts for 2019 were 1.29 million total units, which was 3 percent above the 2018 total of 1.25 million units according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Single family units totaled 888 thousand in 2019, a 1 percent improvement over the 2018 total of 876 thousand. Multi-family starts were 402 thousand units for 2019, which was 7 percent higher than 2018. Our outlook is for continued modest growth in U.S. housing activity. For 2020, we anticipate just over 1.3 million housing starts, with the improvement driven primarily by additional single family activity. Our expectation for continued improvement in housing is based on ongoing employment growth, strong household formations, high consumer confidence and favorable mortgage rates, which have declined over 100 basis points since late 2018 and remain low on a historic basis. 

According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity (LIRA) estimates that residential remodeling expenditures increased 4.8 percent year-over-year during 2019 and will increase by 1.5 percent during 2020. 

Prices for lumber and oriented strand board declined sharply in late 2018 after reaching record highs in the first half of the year due to weather and transportation constraints in the supply chain. During 2019, lumber pricing improved modestly compared with year-end 2018 levels, while pricing for oriented strand board remained generally flat. According to Random Lengths, the Framing Lumber Composite indicator price averaged $356/MBF in 2019, a 23 percent decrease compared with the 2018 average. The Oriented Strand Board Composite indicator price for 2019 averaged $238/MSF, a 38 percent decrease from 2018.  

In Western log markets, Douglas fir sawlog prices declined by 19 percent in 2019 compared with 2018, which was directionally consistent with Western domestic lumber pricing. Conversely, in the South, delivered sawlog prices increased 2 percent in 2019 compared with 2018 as rising lumber output drove incremental demand for sawlogs and wet weather in the first half of the year constrained supply. 

Average Western export log prices declined moderately compared with 2018, falling 11 percent for China logs and 14 percent for Japan grade logs. Exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy also affect our export businesses. The volume of logs imported to China from New Zealand and Europe increased in 2019 over 2018, primarily at the expense of U.S. and Russian volume. A weaker yuan relative to the U.S. dollar reduces the competitiveness of U.S. logs relative to those imported from other countries whose currencies have not appreciated in a similar manner. The yuan weakened 4 percent relative to the U.S. dollar in 2019 averaging 6.91 yuan per U.S. dollar, from 6.61 yuan per U.S. dollar in 2018. 

In Japan, housing starts for November 2019 year to date decreased 3.6 percent from the same period in 2018. However, starts in the key Post and Beam segment declined only 1.5 percent. The decline in housing starts in 2019 is likely due to an increase in the consumption tax which became effective in October 2019. We expect demand from Japan and China in 2020 will be comparable to demand experienced in 2019.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 

HOW WE DID 

Summary of Financial Results 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net Sales 

Net sales decreased $922 million — 12 percent — primarily due to: 

•  

a $674 million decrease in Wood Products net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased sales realizations across the majority of our product lines, and 

•  

a $255 million decrease in Timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to decreased log prices as well as decreased sales volumes in the West. 

These decreases were slightly offset by a $7 million increase in Real Estate & ENR net sales to unaffiliated customers, primarily attributable to increased production-based royalties. 

Costs of Sales 

Costs of sales decreased $180 million — 3 percent — primarily due to lower per unit costs within our Wood Products segment, decreased sales volumes within our Timberlands segment and decreased acres sold in our Real Estate & ENR segment. Refer to additional analysis of fluctuations within our Wood Products, Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources discussions below. 

Operating Income 

Operating income decreased $743 million — 53 percent — primarily due to: 

•  

a $742 million decrease in consolidated gross margin, as described above, and 

•  

an $80 million impairment charge related to our Montana timberlands assets (refer to Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments). 

These were partially offset by a $68 million product remediation insurance recovery and a $48 million gain related to the sale of our Michigan timberland assets (refer to Note 19: Charges (Recoveries) for Product Remediation, Net and Note 4: Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale, respectively). 

Net Earnings 

Net earnings decreased $824 million — 110 percent — primarily due to:  

•  

a $743 million decrease in operating income, as described above; 

•  

a $244 million increase in non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily attributable to a $255 million increase in pension settlement charges (refer to Note 9: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans) and 

•  

a $30 million decrease in interest income and other primarily attributable to the maturity of buyer-sponsored SPE investments in 2019 (refer to Note 8: Related Parties). 

These were partially offset by a $196 million change in income taxes resulting from a $137 million income tax benefit in 2019 compared to a $59 million income tax charge in 2018 (refer to Income Taxes).

TIMBERLANDS 

HOW WE DID 

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Timberlands segment in Our Business/What We Do/Timberlands. 

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Timberlands  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

In 2019, we changed the way we report our Canadian Forestlands operations. As a result, we no longer report related intersegment sales in the Timberlands segment and we now record the minimal associated third-party log sales in the Wood Products segment. These collective transactions did not contribute any earnings to the Timberlands segment. We have conformed prior year presentations with the current year. 

(2)  

In November 2019, we sold our Michigan timberlands. Refer to Note 4: Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale for further information on this divestiture. 

(3)  

Other products include sales of seeds and seedlings from our nursery operations and wood chips. 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net Sales — Unaffiliated Customers 

Net sales to unaffiliated customers decreased $255 million —14 percent— primarily due to: 

•   

a $247 million decrease in Western log sales, attributable to an 18 percent decrease in log prices, as well as a 9 percent decrease in sales volumes; 

•   

a $17 million decrease in stumpage and pay-as-cut timber sales and 

•   

a $7 million decrease in Northern log sales, attributable to a 4 percent decrease in sales volumes, as well as a 3 percent decrease in log prices. 

These decreases were partially offset by a $15 million increase in Southern log sales, attributable to a 1 percent increase in log prices, as well as a 1 percent increase in sales volumes. 

Intersegment Sales 

Intersegment sales decreased $34 million — 6 percent — primarily due to a decrease in Western log prices, as discussed above. 

Costs of Sales 

Costs of sales decreased $86 million — 5 percent — primarily due to a decrease in Western log sales volumes, partially offset by an increase in Southern log sales volumes, as discussed above. 

Operating Income and Net Contribution to Earnings 

Operating income and net contribution to earnings decreased $236 million — 40 percent — primarily due to the change in gross margin, as discussed above, as well as an $80 million impairment charge related to our Montana timberlands assets (refer to Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments). 

These decreases were partially offset by a $48 million gain related to the sale of our Michigan timberlands assets (refer to Note 4: Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale).

REAL ESTATE, ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES 

HOW WE DID 

We report acres sold and average price per acre for our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment in Our Business/What We Do/Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources. 

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including: 

•  

the general state of the economy, 

•  

demand in local real estate markets, 

•  

the ability to obtain entitlements, 

•  

the ability of buyers to obtain financing, 

•  

the number of competing properties listed for sale, 

•  

the seasonal nature of sales (particularly in the northern states), 

•  

the plans of adjacent landowners, 

•  

our expectations of future price appreciation, 

•  

the timing of harvesting activities and 

•  

the availability of government and not-for-profit funding (especially for conservation sales). 

In any period, the average sales price per acre will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold. 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net Sales — Unaffiliated Buyers 

Net sales to unaffiliated buyers increased $7 million — 2 percent — primarily attributable to an $11 million increase in energy and natural resources sales from an increase in production-based royalties, partially offset by a decrease in real estate acres sold. 

Costs of Sales 

Costs of sales decreased $10 million — 6 percent — primarily attributable to decreased real estate acres sold. 

Net Contribution to Earnings 

Net contribution to earnings increased $17 million — 13 percent — attributable to the increase in gross margin as discussed above.

WOOD PRODUCTS 

HOW WE DID 

We report sales volume and annual production data for our Wood Products segment in Our Business/What We Do/Wood Products. 

Net Sales and Net Contribution to Earnings for Wood Products 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Other products produced sales include wood chips, other byproducts and third-party residual log sales from our Canadian Forestlands operations. In 2019, we changed the way we report our Canadian Forestlands operations, which are primarily operated to supply our Canadian Wood Products manufacturing facilities. As a result, we now record the minimal associated third-party log sales in the Wood Products segment. These transactions do not contribute any earnings to the Wood Products segment. We have conformed prior year presentations with the current year. 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net Sales 

Net sales decreased $674 million — 13 percent — primarily due to: 

•   

a $366 million decrease in structural lumber sales attributable to a 19 percent decrease in realizations, partially offset by a 4 percent increase in sales volumes;  

•   

a $259 million decrease in oriented strand board sales attributable to a 31 percent decrease in realizations, partially offset by a 3 percent increase in sales volumes; 

•   

a $39 million decrease in softwood plywood sales attributable to a 17 percent decrease in realizations, as well as a 3 percent decrease in sales volumes; 

•   

a $13 million decrease in engineered I-joists sales attributable to a 6 percent decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 2 percent increase in realizations; 

•   

an $11 million decrease in engineered solid section sales attributable to a 5 percent decrease in sales volumes, partially offset by a 2 percent increase in realizations and 

•   

an $11 million decrease in medium density fiberboard sales attributable to a 6 percent decrease in sales volumes. 

These decreases were partially offset by an $18 million increase in sales for complementary building products and a $7 million increase in sales for other products produced. 

Costs of Sales 

Costs of sales decreased $130 million — 3 percent — primarily attributable to lower per unit costs across most product lines. 

Operating Income and Net Contribution to Earnings 

Operating income and net contribution to earnings decreased $485 million — 58 percent — primarily due to the change in gross margin, as discussed above, partially offset by a $68 million product remediation insurance recovery in 2019 with no similar activity in 2018 (refer to Note 19: Charges (Recoveries) for Product Remediation, Net).

UNALLOCATED ITEMS 

Unallocated Items are gains or charges related to company level initiatives or previous businesses that are not allocated to our current business segments. They include all or a portion of items such as: 

•  

share-based compensation, 

•  

pension and postretirement costs, 

•  

elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, 

•  

foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in exchange rates primarily related to our U.S. dollar denominated cash and debt balances that are held by our Canadian subsidiary, 

•  

interest income and other, as well as 

•  

legacy obligations, such as environmental remediation and workers compensation. 

Net Charge to Earnings for Unallocated Items 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Net charge to earnings increased by $313 million — 86 percent — primarily due to: 

•  

a $244 million increase in non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs primarily attributable to a $255 million increase in pension settlement charges (refer to Note 9: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans); 

•  

a $29 million decrease in interest income and other primarily attributable to the maturity of buyer-sponsored SPE investments in 2019 (refer to Note 8: Related Parties) and 

•  

a $17 million increase in expense related to liability classified share-based compensation attributable to the company’s stock price increasing for the year-to-date period ended December 31, 2019 compared to the stock price decreasing for the year-to-date period ended December 31, 2018.  

INTEREST EXPENSE 

Our net interest expense incurred for the last two years was: 

•  

$378 million in 2019 and 

•  

$375 million in 2018. 

Interest expense increased by $3 million compared to 2018 primarily due to a $12 million charge related to the early extinguishment of debt recorded in 2019, partially offset by the decreased weighted average interest rate on our debt portfolio. 

INCOME TAXES 

As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal corporate level income taxes on REIT taxable income that is distributed to shareholders. Historical distributions to shareholders, including amounts and tax characteristics, are summarized in the table below. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2019 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 44 

Table of Contents 

We are required to pay corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs, which include our Wood Products segment and portions of our Timberlands and Real Estate & ENR segments' earnings. Our provision for income taxes is primarily driven by earnings generated by our TRSs.  

Our provision (benefit) for income taxes the last two years was: 

•  

$(137) million in 2019 and 

•  

$59 million in 2018. 

During 2019, we recorded a $109 million tax benefit related to the noncash pretax settlement charge recorded in connection with our U.S. pension plan and a $17 million tax expense related to an insurance recovery received in connection with prior product remediation efforts. 

During 2018, we recorded a $41 million tax benefit related to contributions made to our pension plan and deducted on our 2017 U.S. federal tax return and a $21 million charge related to a tax settlement. 

See Note 21: Income Taxes, which outlines the major components related to our income tax provision. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

We are committed to maintaining an appropriate capital structure that enables us to: 

•  

protect the interests of our shareholders and lenders and 

•  

have access to major financial markets. 

CASH FROM OPERATIONS 

Consolidated net cash from operations was: 

•  

$966 million in 2019 and 

•  

$1,112 million in 2018. 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net cash from operations decreased by $146 million, primarily due to a decrease in cash inflows from our business segments.  

This decrease in net cash was partially offset by: 

•  

a $336 million decrease in pension and postretirement contributions and benefit payments, which is primarily related to the $300 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2018 (refer to Note 9: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans for further information) and 

•  

a $97 million decrease in cash paid for taxes. 

Pension Contributions and Benefit Payments Made and Expected 

During 2019, we contributed a total of $45 million to our pension and postretirement plans. During 2018, we contributed a total of $381 million to our pension and postretirement plans, including a voluntary contribution of $300 million to our U.S. qualified plan. 

For 2020, we expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our pension and postretirement benefit plans. Refer to Note 9: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans for further information. 

INVESTING IN OUR BUSINESS 

Cash from investing activities includes items such as: 

•  

acquisitions of property, equipment, timberlands and reforestation and 

•  

proceeds from sales of assets and operations. 

Consolidated net cash from investing activities was: 

•  

$187 million in 2019 and 

•  

$(440) million in 2018. 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net cash from investing activities increased by $627 million primarily due to: 

•  

$297 million of cash proceeds received from the sale of our Michigan timberlands in 2019, with no similar activity in 2018 (refer to Note 4: Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale for further information); 

•  

$253 million of cash proceeds received related to our buyer-sponsored variable interest entities (VIEs) in 2019, with no similar activity in 2018 (refer to Note 8: Related Parties) and 

•  

a $43 million decrease in cash outflow for capital expenditures. 

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2019 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 45 

Table of Contents 

Summary of Capital Spending by Business Segment 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We expect our net capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $360 million. The amount we spend on capital expenditures could change due to: 

•  

future economic conditions, 

•  

environmental regulations, 

•  

changes in the composition of our business, 

•  

weather, 

•  

timing of equipment purchases and 

•  

capital needs related to other business opportunities. 

FINANCING 

Cash from financing activities includes items, such as: 

•  

issuances and payments of debt, 

•  

borrowings and payments on our revolving line of credit, 

•  

proceeds from option exercises and 

•  

payments for cash dividends and repurchasing stock. 

Consolidated net cash from financing activities was: 

•  

$(1,348) million in 2019 and 

•  

$(1,162) million in 2018. 

COMPARING 2019 WITH 2018 

Net cash from financing activities decreased $186 million in 2019, primarily due to the following: 

•  

a $620 million decrease in net cash received related to borrowings on our line of credit (refer to Note 11: Line of Credit); 

•  

a $93 million increase in payments on debt held by VIEs (refer to Note 8: Related Parties); 

•  

a $39 million decrease in cash received from exercise of stock options and 

•  

an $18 million increase in cash used for payments of dividends. 

These were partially offset by the following: 

•  

a $289 million increase in net cash proceeds received related to long-term debt (refer to Note 12: Long-Term Debt) and 

•  

a $306 million decrease in cash used to repurchase common shares. 

LONG-TERM DEBT 

Our consolidated long-term debt (including current portion) was: 

•  

$6.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 

•  

$5.9 billion as of December 31, 2018. 

The increase in our long-term debt during 2019 is attributable to the issuance of $750 million of 4.00 percent notes due in November 2029 offset by the repayment of our $500 million 7.38 percent note.  

The weighted average interest rate and the weighted average maturity on our long-term debt (excluding line of credit) as of December 31, 2019 were 5.90 percent and 6.9 years, respectively.  

See Note 12: Long-Term Debt for more information about the long-term debt discussed above. 

LINE OF CREDIT 

In March 2017, we entered into a $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in March 2022. As of December 31, 2019, we had $230 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility and had an additional $1,270 million available. As of December 31, 2018, we had $425 million of outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facility. We were in compliance with the revolving credit facility covenants as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. 

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2019 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 46 

Table of Contents 

In January 2020, we amended and restated our $1.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which now expires in January 2025.  

Our revolving credit agreement and our 2017 term loan agreement utilize the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a basis for one of the interest rate options available to the company to apply to outstanding borrowings. LIBOR is expected to be discontinued at some point during 2021, and we are closely monitoring ongoing market developments in the identification or creation of a widely accepted replacement rate. We have included provisions in our new revolving credit agreement that specifically contemplate the transition from LIBOR to a replacement benchmark rate. We have also discussed the impending discontinuation of LIBOR with our 2017 term loan lenders, and based on those discussions, we expect to amend our term loan agreement to reflect a new reference rate to replace LIBOR, but we do not know with any certainty when that will occur.  

As of December 31, 2019, of our $6.1 billion long-term debt and $230 million line of credit borrowings, only $455 million in borrowings are governed by debt agreements that utilize LIBOR as one of the alternative applicable rates. We therefore do not believe that the discontinuation of LIBOR as a reference rate in our debt agreements will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or materially affect our interest expense.  

Our Covenants 

Our key covenants include the requirement to maintain: 

•  

a minimum total adjusted shareholders' equity of $3.0 billion and 

•  

a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 65 percent or less. 

Our total adjusted shareholders' equity is comprised of: 

•  

total shareholders’ equity, 

•  

excluding accumulated comprehensive income (loss), 

•  

minus our investment in our unrestricted subsidiaries. 

Our capitalization is comprised of: 

•  

total debt 

•  

plus total adjusted shareholders' equity. 

As of December 31, 2019, we had: 

•  

a defined total adjusted shareholders' equity of $8.7 billion and 

•  

a defined debt-to-total-capital ratio of 42.24 percent. 

When calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2019, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $904 million. When calculating compliance in accordance with financial debt covenants as of December 31, 2018, we excluded the full amount of accumulated other comprehensive loss of $1,152 million. See Note 15: Shareholders’ Interest. 

There are no other significant financial debt covenants related to our third-party debt.  

CREDIT RATINGS 

As of December 31, 2019, our long-term issuer credit rating was BBB and Baa2 from S&P and Moody’s, respectively. 

OPTION EXERCISES 

Our cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options were: 

•  

$13 million in 2019 and 

•  

$52 million in 2018. 

Our average stock price was $26.45 and $33.30 in 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

DIVIDENDS 

We paid cash dividends on common shares of: 

•  

$1,013 million in 2019 and 

•  

$995 million in 2018. 

The increase in dividends paid is primarily due to an increase in our year-to-date dividends from $1.32 per share for 2018 to $1.36 per share for 2019. 

SHARE REPURCHASES 

We repurchased over 2.3 million shares for approximately $60 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended December 31, 2019, under the 2019 Repurchase Program. We repurchased over 11.4 million shares for approximately $366 million (including transaction fees) during the year ended December 31, 2018, under the 2016 Repurchase Program. There were no unsettled repurchases as of December 31, 2019, or December 31, 2018. For information on share repurchases, see Note 15: Shareholders’ Interest.

OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS 

More details about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments are in Note 9: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans, Note 11: Line of Credit, Note 12: Long-Term Debt, Note 14: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies and Note 21: Income Taxes. 

Significant Contractual Obligations as of December 31, 2019 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Does not include nonrecourse debt held by our VIEs. See Note 8: Related Parties for further information on our VIEs and the related nonrecourse debt. 

(2)  

All outstanding amounts are required to be repaid upon the line of credit expiration. The timing of the repayment of the current outstanding balance is uncertain. See Note 11: Line of Credit for further information on our line of credit. 

(3)  

Amounts presented for interest payments assume that all long-term debt obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2019, will remain outstanding until maturity and interest rates on variable-rate debt in effect as of December 31, 2019 will remain in effect until maturity. 

(4)  

Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude arrangements that the company can cancel without penalty. 

(5)  

The timing of certain payments within this category will be triggered by retirements or other events. These payments can include workers' compensation, deferred compensation and banked vacation, among other obligations. When the timing of payment is uncertain, the amounts are included in the total column only. Minimum pension funding is required by established funding standards and estimates are not made beyond 2020. Estimated payments of contractually obligated postretirement benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing. 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 

Off-balance sheet arrangements have not had — and are not reasonably likely to have — a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Note 8: Related Parties, Note 11: Line of Credit and Note 14: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies contain our disclosures of: 

•  

surety bonds, 

•  

letters of credit and guarantees and 

•

ACCOUNTING MATTERS 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

In the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position are considered critical accounting policies. 

In accounting, we base our judgments and estimates on: 

•  

historical experience and 

•  

assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances. 

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2019 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 48 

Table of Contents 

Actual results, however, may differ from the estimated amounts we have recorded. 

Our most critical accounting policies relate to our: 

•  

pension and postretirement benefit plans; 

•  

potential impairments of long-lived assets and 

•  

legal, environmental and product liability reserves. 

Details about our other significant accounting policies — what we use and how we estimate — are in Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 

We sponsor several pension and postretirement benefit plans for our employees. Key estimates we use in accounting for the plans include the: 

•  

fair value of our plan assets, 

•  

expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and 

•  

discount rates. 

At the end of every year, we review our key estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. We use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and postretirement expense for the following year. Actual experience that differs from our estimates or any changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

Fair Value of Plan Assets 

Plan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process. In some cases, primarily for private equity and hedge funds, the available information consists of net asset values as of an interim date, adjusted for known events occurring between the interim date and year-end. 

We value the pension plan assets based on the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify them based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. These inputs are classified within the fair value hierarchy as follows: 

•  

Level 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market. 

•  

Level 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date. 

•  

Level 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable. 

Assets that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. 

In general, we value our pension plan assets as follows: 

•  

cash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market; 

•  

fixed income and public equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in the public market; 

•  

hedge funds, private equity funds and related fund units are primarily valued based on the net asset value of the funds and 

•  

derivative instruments are valued based upon valuation statements received from each derivative’s counterparty. 

Assets that do not have readily available quoted prices in an active market require more judgment to value and have increased valuation risk. 

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets 

Our expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. This rate is important in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans. 

During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we utilized a long-term rate of return on plan assets of 8.0 percent. At the end of 2018, we began implementing a change in our asset strategy to an allocation that more closely aligns with the plan’s liability profile moving forward. This results in a larger allocation of our assets into fixed income securities. With this change, we determined that it was appropriate to reduce our assumption of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to 7.0 percent for the year ended December 31, 2019. As this strategy has been in place throughout 2019 and a larger percentage of our portfolio has been allocated to fixed income securities, we have determined that an additional reduction in our assumption of long-term rate of return on plan assets to 6.5 percent is appropriate for the year ended December 31, 2020.  

Factors we considered include: 

•  

historical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and 

•  

expected future performance of similar asset classes. 

Every 50 basis point decrease in our expected long-term rate of return would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately: 

•  

$14 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and 

WEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > 2019 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K 49 

Table of Contents 

•  

$4 million for our Canadian registered pension plans. 

The actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity. 

Discount Rates 

The discount rate is used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. Our discount rates as of December 31, 2019 are: 

•  

3.4 percent for our U.S. pension plans — compared with 4.4 percent at December 31, 2018; 

•  

3.0 percent for our U.S. postretirement plans — compared with 4.2 percent at December 31, 2018; 

•  

3.1 percent for our Canadian pension plans — compared with 3.7 percent at December 31, 2018 and 

•  

3.0 percent for our Canadian postretirement plans — compared with 3.7 percent at December 31, 2018. 

The discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. 

Pension expenses for 2020 will be based on the 3.4 percent and 3.1 percent assumed discount rates for the U.S. pension plan and the Canadian pension plan, respectively, and 3.0 percent assumed discount rate for the U.S. and Canadian postretirement benefit plans. 

Our discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans. A 50 basis point decrease in our discount rate would increase expense or reduce a credit by approximately: 

•  

$19 million for our U.S. qualified pension plans and 

•  

$5 million for our Canadian registered pension plans. 

IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS 

We review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. Refer to Note 18: Charges for Integration and Restructuring, Closures and Asset Impairments for information on an impairment recognized in 2019. 

If we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. Key assumptions used in developing these estimates would include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales. 

An impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset). Key assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes. 

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 

We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss. 

We record contingent liabilities when: 

•  

it becomes probable that we will have to make payments and 

•  

the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. 

Assessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss requires analysis of multiple factors, including: 

•  

historical experience, 

•  

evaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations, 

•  

judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and 

•  

consideration of potential environmental remediation methods. 

In addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred. 

Recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate negative outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given quarter or year. See Note 14: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies for more information.

PERFORMANCE MEASURES 

We use adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) as a key performance measure to evaluate the performance of the consolidated company and our business segments. This measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.  

Adjusted EBITDA by Segment 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We reconcile Adjusted EBITDA to net earnings for the consolidated company and to operating income for the business segments, as those are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for each. 

The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA by segment to net loss for the year ended December 31, 2019: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Interest expense, net of capitalized interest includes a pretax special item of $12 million related to a charge for the early extinguishment of debt.  

(2)  

Non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs includes pretax special items consisting of $455 million noncash settlement charges related to the transfers of pension plan assets and liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of group annuity contracts.  

(3)  

Operating income (loss) for Timberlands includes pretax special items consisting of an $80 million noncash impairment charge related to the agreement to sell our Montana timberlands and a $48 million gain on sale of our Michigan timberlands. 

(4)  

Operating income (loss) for Wood Products includes a pretax special item consisting of a $68 million product remediation insurance recovery. 

(5)  

Operating income (loss) for Unallocated Items includes pretax special items consisting of $35 million of legal charges.

The table below reconciles Adjusted EBITDA by segment to net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2018: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Income taxes include special items consisting of a $41 million tax benefit related to our pension contribution and a $21 million tax adjustment charge.  

(2)  

Non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs include a pretax special item consisting of a $200 million noncash settlement charge related to our U.S. qualified pension plan lump sum offer.  

(3)  

Interest income and other includes a pretax special item consisting of a $13 million gain on sale of a nonstrategic asset.  

(4)  

Operating income (loss) for Unallocated Items includes a pretax special item consisting of a $28 million environmental remediation expense. 

We also reconcile net earnings before special items to net earnings and net earnings per diluted share before special items to net earnings per diluted share, as those are the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. We believe the measures provide meaningful supplemental information for investors about our operating performance, better facilitate period to period comparisons, and are widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties.
