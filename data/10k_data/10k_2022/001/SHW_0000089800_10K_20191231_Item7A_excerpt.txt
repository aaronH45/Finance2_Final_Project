ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. In 2019, the Company entered into a U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contract to hedge the Company's net investment in its European operations. This contract has been designated as a net investment hedge and will mature on January 15, 2022. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2019 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
