Research and Development

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Technology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history. The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs. Additionally, we operate laboratories in close geographic proximity to our customers, and we customize our products for our customers' end-use applications. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management. We have obtained government funding for a small portion of the Company’s research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate.

We own and operate several facilities to conduct research and development for new and improved products and processes. In addition to the Company’s centralized principal research and development centers (See Item 2. “Properties” of this Form 10-K), operating segments manage their development through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate global competitive sourcing laboratories. Because of our broad array of products and customers, we are not materially dependent upon any single technology platform.

Raw Materials, Energy and Logistics

The effective management of raw materials, energy and logistics is important to PPG’s continued success as PPG uses a wide variety of complex raw materials that serve as the building blocks of our manufactured products. The Company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins, titanium dioxide and other pigments, and solvents in the coatings businesses and sand and soda ash in the specialty coatings and materials business. Raw materials include both organic, primarily petroleum-derived, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide. These raw materials represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.

Most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet our planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts with multiple sources and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible. Our raw materials include bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. While prices for certain raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices and global supply and demand changes, such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that the manufacture of our raw materials is several steps downstream from crude oil and natural gas inputs.

We are continuing our aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple sources of supply, both local and international, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world, adding on-site resin production at certain manufacturing locations and reducing the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations.

We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes. Our ongoing, global product stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards. Changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the European Union and many other countries, including China, Canada, the United States (“U.S.”), Brazil, Mexico and South Korea. Because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized, the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.

PPG has joined a global initiative to eliminate child labor from the mica industry, and the Company is continuing to take steps, including audits of our suppliers, to ensure compliance with PPG’s policy against the use of child labor in our supply chains.

We typically experience fluctuating prices for energy and raw materials driven by various factors, including changes in supplier feedstock costs and inventories, global industry activity levels, foreign currency exchange rates, government regulation, and global supply and demand factors. For 2019 versus 2018, we experienced a deflationary movement in costs, particularly in the second half of 2019, driven by a general slowdown in industrial demand affecting the global supply and demand balance in several of our key purchasing categories. This was in addition to pricing decreases in most of our key feedstocks throughout 2019. In contrast, average raw material costs rose by a mid-single-digit percentage in 2018 versus 2017 due to the rise in feedstock prices, acute shortages in key raw materials and the impact of Chinese environmental regulations. 

Given the continuing volatility in certain energy-based input costs, particularly the volatility in oil and oil-based derivatives, and foreign currencies, we are not able to predict with certainty the 2020 full-year impact of changes in raw material pricing 

10 2019 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND 10-K

versus 2019. Further, given the distribution nature of many of our businesses, logistics and distribution costs are sizable, as are wage and benefit changes. For 2019 versus 2018, we experienced a slight decrease in our logistics costs as a percentage of sales driven by operational efficiency improvements and through sourcing efforts to take advantage of the reduction in industry surface transportation shipping rates due to an improvement in the availability of transportation assets. We expect these costs to remain steady or be slightly lower through 2020 given the continuing efforts by PPG to improve our global operational efficiencies.

Backlog

In general, PPG does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders.

Global Operations

PPG has a significant investment in non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region on our total Net sales and Income before income taxes in the consolidated statement of income. As a result of our expansion outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets, trade protection measures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. During 2019, unfavorable foreign currency translation decreased Net sales by approximately $400 million and Income before income taxes by approximately $50 million.

Our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended December 31st are summarized below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Refer to Note 21, “Reportable Business Segment Information” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information related to PPG’s property, plant and equipment, and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales.

Seasonality 

PPG’s Income before income taxes has typically been greater in the second and third quarters and Cash from operating activities has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in our architectural coatings businesses. Demand for our architectural coatings products is typically the strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Latin America paint season is the strongest in the fourth quarter. These cyclical activity levels result in the collection of outstanding receivables and lower inventory on hand in the fourth quarter generating higher Cash from operating activities.

Employee Relations

The average number of people employed worldwide by PPG during 2019 was approximately 47,600. The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, laws and practices in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements. There were no significant work stoppages in 2019. While we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe that we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms. To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on our results of operations. Overall, we believe we have good relationships with our employees.

Environmental Matters

PPG is committed to operating in a sustainable manner and to helping our customers meet their sustainability goals. Our sustainability efforts are led by the Technology and Environment Committee of our Board of Directors and our Sustainability Committee, which is comprised of members of PPG’s senior management team. The Sustainability Committee establishes policies, programs, procedures and goals to address sustainability in our business practices, including resource management, climate change, innovation, communications, purchasing, manufacturing and employee wellness. 

Our dedication to innovation is intertwined with sustainability. Once again, we increased the percent of our sales from sustainable products to 33% in 2019 from 32% in 2018. We are marketing an ever-growing variety of products and services that provide environmental, safety and other benefits to our customers. Our products contribute to lighter, more fuel-efficient vehicles, airplanes and ships, and they help our customers reduce their energy consumption, conserve water and reduce waste. These products include a compact automotive paint process that saves energy and reduces water usage; sustainable,

waterborne coatings formulations; lightweight sealants and coatings for aircraft; coatings that cool surfaces; coatings for recyclable metal packaging; and solutions for autonomous and battery-powered vehicles. 

The Company’s commitment to sustainability continues to yield tangible results. In 2019, we again made significant progress reducing our energy intensity, greenhouse gas emissions intensity and waste intensity. More information about PPG’s sustainability values, efforts, goals and data and our community and employee engagement programs can be found in our Sustainability Report and on our sustainability website at http://sustainability.ppg.com and on the CDP’s website at www.cdp.net.

We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the protection of the environment. In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner and is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including certain sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.

Our experience to date regarding environmental matters leads us to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.

In addition to the $304 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $100 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites, none of which are individually significant. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

It is expected that capital expenditures for such projects in 2020 will be in the range of $20 million to $30 million. Although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies, it can be anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase.

Management believes that the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. See Note 14, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs.
