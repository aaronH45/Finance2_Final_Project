PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Vornado is a fully‑integrated REIT and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, the Operating Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership. Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.1% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2019.

We currently own all or portions of: 

New York:

•19.1 million square feet of Manhattan office in 35 properties;

•2.3 million square feet of Manhattan street retail in 70 properties;

•1,991 units in 10 residential properties;

•The 1,700 room Hotel Pennsylvania located on Seventh Avenue at 33rd Street in the heart of the Penn District; and 

•A 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, including 731 Lexington Avenue, the 1.3 million square foot Bloomberg, L.P. headquarters building.

Other Real Estate and Investments:

•The 3.7 million square foot theMART in Chicago;

•A 70% controlling interest in 555 California Street, a three-building office complex in San Francisco’s financial district aggregating 1.8 million square feet;

•A 25.0% interest in Vornado Capital Partners, our real estate fund (the "Fund"). We are the general partner and investment manager of the Fund; and

•Other real estate and investments.

OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGY

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value. We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

DISPOSITIONS

We contributed seven properties to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV and transferred a 48.5% common interest in the joint venture to a group of institutional investors for net cash proceeds of $1.179 billion. We retained the remaining 51.5% common interest and an aggregate $1.828 billion of preferred equity interests in certain of the properties.

We also completed the following sale transactions during 2019:

•$1.61 billion net proceeds from the sale of 54 condominium units at 220 Central Park South;

COMPETITION

We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See "Risk Factors" in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

SEGMENT DATA

We operate in the following reportable segments: New York and Other.

SEASONALITY 

Our revenues and expenses are subject to seasonality during the year which impacts quarterly net earnings, cash flows and funds from operations, and therefore impacts comparisons of the current quarter to the previous quarter. The New York segment has historically experienced higher utility costs in the first and third quarters of the year. 

TENANTS ACCOUNTING FOR OVER 10% OF REVENUES 

None of our tenants accounted for more than 10% of total revenues in any of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

We have historically held our properties for long‑term investment; however, it is possible that properties in our portfolio may be sold or otherwise disposed of when circumstances warrant. Further, we have not adopted a policy that limits the amount or percentage of assets which could be invested in a specific property or property type. Generally our activities are reviewed and may be modified from time to time by Vornado’s Board of Trustees without the vote of our shareholders or Operating Partnership unitholders.
