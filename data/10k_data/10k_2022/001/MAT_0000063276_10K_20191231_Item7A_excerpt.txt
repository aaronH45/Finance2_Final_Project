Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Currency exchange rate fluctuations impact Mattel’s results of operations and cash flows. Inventory transactions denominated in the Euro, Mexican peso, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Russian ruble, Brazilian real, and Australian dollar were the primary transactions that caused foreign currency transaction exposure for Mattel in 2019. Mattel seeks to mitigate its exposure to market risk by monitoring its foreign currency transaction exposure for the year and partially hedging such exposure using foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to hedge its purchase and sale of inventory and other intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts generally have maturity dates of up to 18 months. For those intercompany receivables and payables that are not hedged, the transaction gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the exchange rate changes as part of operating (loss) income or other non-operating expense, net based on the nature of the underlying transaction. Transaction gains or losses on hedged intercompany inventory transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the inventory is sold to customers. In addition, Mattel manages its exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations through the selection of currencies used for international borrowings. Mattel does not trade in financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Mattel’s financial position is also impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations on translation of its net investments in subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at fiscal year-end exchange rates. Income, expense, and cash flow items are translated at weighted-average exchange rates prevailing during the fiscal year. The resulting currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity. Mattel’s primary currency translation exposures in 2019 were related to its net investments in entities having functional currencies denominated in the Euro, British pound sterling, Russian ruble, and Mexican peso. 

There are numerous factors impacting the amount by which Mattel’s financial results are affected by foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, including, but not limited to, the level of foreign currency forward exchange contracts in place at a given time and the volume of foreign currency-denominated transactions in a given period. However, assuming that such factors were held constant, Mattel estimates that a 1 percent change in the U.S. dollar Trade-Weighted Index would impact Mattel’s net sales by approximately 0.5% and its full year loss per share by approximately $0.00 to $0.01.

Mattel’s foreign currency forward exchange contracts that were used to hedge firm foreign currency commitments as of December 31, 2019 are shown below. All contracts in the following table are against the U.S. dollar and are maintained by reporting units with a U.S. dollar functional currency, with the exception of the Indonesian rupiah contracts, which are maintained by entities with an Indonesian rupiah functional currency.

(a)The weighted-average contract rate for these contracts is quoted in U.S. dollar per local currency. 

For the purchase of foreign currencies, fair value reflects the amount, based on dealer quotes, that Mattel would pay at maturity for contracts involving the same notional amounts, currencies, and maturity dates, if they had been entered into as of December 31, 2019. For the sale of foreign currencies, fair value reflects the amount, based on dealer quotes, that Mattel would receive at maturity for contracts involving the same notional amounts, currencies, and maturity dates, if they had been entered into as of December 31, 2019. The differences between the market forward amounts and the contract amounts are expected to be fully offset by currency transaction gains and losses on the underlying hedged transactions.

In addition to the contracts involving the U.S. dollar detailed in the above table, Mattel also had contracts to sell British pound sterling for the purchase of Euro. As of December 31, 2019, these contracts had a contract amount of $56.5 million and a fair value of $(1.8 million).

Had Mattel not entered into hedges to limit the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations on its results of operations and cash flows, its loss before income taxes would have increased by approximately $20 million in 2019 and decreased by approximately $32 million in 2018.

United Kingdom Operations 

During June 2016, the referendum by British voters to exit the EU ("Brexit") adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a sharp decline of the British pound sterling against the U.S. dollar. In February 2017, the British Parliament voted in favor of allowing the British government to begin the formal process of Brexit and discussions with the EU began in March 2017. On January 29, 2020, the British Parliament approved a withdrawal agreement, and the United Kingdom ("U.K.") officially withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020 and entered into the transition period. During the transition period, the U.K. will continue to be treated as a member of the single market and customs union and the EU has requested that states with EU trade agreements treat the U.K. as a member state until the end of transition. The transition period is through December 2020, with an option to extend an additional one to two years, to allow for businesses and individuals to adjust to its changes, during which all EU regulations will continue to apply to the U.K.

 In the short-term, volatility in the British pound sterling could continue as the U.K. negotiates a new trade deal with the EU. In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on Mattel's U.K. operations will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. Mattel's U.K. operations represented approximately 5% of Mattel's consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Argentina Operations 

Effective July 1, 2018, Mattel accounted for Argentina as a highly inflationary economy, as the projected three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As such, beginning July 1, 2018, Mattel's Argentina subsidiary has designated the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Mattel’s Argentina subsidiary represented less than 1% of Mattel's consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.
