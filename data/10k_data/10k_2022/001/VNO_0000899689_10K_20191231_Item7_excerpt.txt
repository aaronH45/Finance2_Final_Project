Introduction

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes included under Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") within this section is focused on the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, including year-to-year comparisons between these years. Our MD&A for the year ended December 31, 2017, including year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017, can be found in Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.

Overview

Vornado Realty Trust (“Vornado”) is a fully‑integrated real estate investment trust (“REIT”) and conducts its business through, and substantially all of its interests in properties are held by, Vornado Realty L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “Operating Partnership”). Accordingly, Vornado’s cash flow and ability to pay dividends to its shareholders are dependent upon the cash flow of the Operating Partnership and the ability of its direct and indirect subsidiaries to first satisfy their obligations to creditors. Vornado is the sole general partner of, and owned approximately 93.1% of the common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2019. All references to the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” mean collectively Vornado, the Operating Partnership and those subsidiaries consolidated by Vornado.

We own and operate office and retail properties with a concentration in the New York City metropolitan area. In addition, we have a 32.4% interest in Alexander’s, Inc. (“Alexander’s”) (NYSE: ALX), which owns seven properties in the greater New York metropolitan area, as well as interests in other real estate and investments.

Our business objective is to maximize Vornado shareholder value, which we measure by the total return provided to our shareholders. Below is a table comparing Vornado’s performance to the FTSE NAREIT Office Index (“Office REIT”) and the MSCI US REIT Index (“MSCI”) for the following periods ended December 31, 2019:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________

(1)Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.

We intend to achieve this objective by continuing to pursue our investment philosophy and to execute our operating strategies through:

•maintaining a superior team of operating and investment professionals and an entrepreneurial spirit;

•investing in properties in select markets, such as New York City, where we believe there is a high likelihood of capital appreciation;

•acquiring quality properties at a discount to replacement cost and where there is a significant potential for higher rents;

•developing and redeveloping our existing properties to increase returns and maximize value; and

•investing in operating companies that have a significant real estate component.

We expect to finance our growth, acquisitions and investments using internally generated funds, proceeds from asset sales and by accessing the public and private capital markets. We may also offer Vornado common or preferred shares or Operating Partnership units in exchange for property and may repurchase or otherwise reacquire these securities in the future.

We compete with a large number of real estate investors, property owners and developers, some of which may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments. Principal factors of competition are rents charged, sales prices, attractiveness of location, the quality of the property and the breadth and the quality of services provided. Our success depends upon, among other factors, trends of the global, national, regional and local economies, the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants and customers, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs, taxes, governmental regulations, legislation, population and employment trends. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A for additional information regarding these factors.

Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV

On April 18, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), we entered into a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) with a group of institutional investors (the “Investors”). The Transaction Agreement provides for a series of transactions (collectively, the “Transaction”) pursuant to which (i) prior to the Closing Date, we contributed our interests in properties located at 640 Fifth Avenue, 655 Fifth Avenue, 666 Fifth Avenue, 689 Fifth Avenue, 697-703 Fifth Avenue, 1535 Broadway and 1540 Broadway (collectively, the “Properties”) to subsidiaries of a newly formed joint venture (“Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV”) and (ii) on the Closing Date, transferred a 48.5% common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV to the Investors. The 48.5% common interest in the joint venture represents an effective 47.2% interest in the Properties (of which 45.4% was transferred from Vornado). The Properties include approximately 489,000 square feet of retail space, 327,000 square feet of office space, signage associated with 1535 and 1540 Broadway, the parking garage at 1540 Broadway and the theater at 1535 Broadway. 

We retained the remaining 51.5% common interest in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV which represents an effective 51.0% interest in the Properties and an aggregate $1.828 billion of preferred equity interests in certain of the properties. We also provided $500,000,000 of temporary preferred equity on 640 Fifth Avenue until May 23, 2019 when mortgage financing was completed. All of the preferred equity has an annual coupon of 4.25% for the first five years, increasing to 4.75% for the next five years and thereafter at a formulaic rate. It can be redeemed under certain conditions on a tax deferred basis. 

Net cash proceeds from the Transaction were $1.179 billion, after (i) deductions for the defeasance of a $390,000,000 mortgage loan on 666 Fifth Avenue and the repayment of a $140,000,000 mortgage loan on 655 Fifth Avenue, (ii) proceeds from a $500,000,000 mortgage loan on 640 Fifth Avenue, described below, (iii) approximately $23,000,000 used to purchase noncontrolling investors' interests and (iv) approximately $53,000,000 of transaction costs (including $17,000,000 of costs related to the defeasance of the 666 Fifth Avenue mortgage loan). 

We continue to manage and lease the Properties. We share control with the Investors over major decisions of the joint venture, including decisions regarding leasing, operating and capital budgets, and refinancings. Accordingly, we no longer hold a controlling financial interest in the Properties which has been transferred to the joint venture. As a result, our investment in Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV is accounted for under the equity method from the date of transfer. The Transaction valued the Properties at $5.556 billion resulting in a financial statement net gain of $2.571 billion, before noncontrolling interest of $11,945,000, including the related step up in our basis of the retained portion of the assets to fair value. The net gain is included in "net gain on transfer to Fifth Avenue and Times Square JV" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain for tax purposes was approximately $735,000,000.

On May 23, 2019, we received $500,000,000 from the redemption of our temporary preferred equity in 640 Fifth Avenue. The temporary preferred equity was redeemed from the proceeds of a $500,000,000 mortgage financing that was completed on the property. The five-year loan, which is guaranteed by us, is interest-only at LIBOR plus 1.01%. The interest rate was swapped for four years to a fixed rate of 3.07%. 

330 Madison Avenue

On July 11, 2019, we sold our 25% interest in 330 Madison Avenue to our joint venture partner. We received net proceeds of approximately $100,000,000 after deducting our share of the existing $500,000,000 mortgage loan resulting in a financial statement net gain of $159,292,000. The net gain is included in "net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019. The gain for tax purposes was approximately $139,000,000.

3040 M Street

On September 18, 2019, we completed the $49,750,000 sale of 3040 M Street, a 44,000 square foot retail building in Washington, DC, which resulted in a net gain of $19,477,000 which is included in “net gains on disposition of wholly owned and partially owned assets” on our consolidated statements of income for year ended December 31, 2019. The gain for tax purposes was approximately $19,000,000.

PREIT

On January 23, 2020, we sold all of our 6,250,000 common shares of PREIT, realizing net proceeds of $28,375,000. A $4,938,000 loss (mark-to-market decrease) will be recorded in the first quarter of 2020. 

Financings

Senior Unsecured Notes

On March 1, 2019, we called for redemption all of our $400,000,000 5.00% senior unsecured notes. The notes, which were scheduled to mature in January 2022, were redeemed on April 1, 2019 at a redemption price of 105.51% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. In connection therewith, we expensed $22,540,000 relating to debt prepayment costs which is included in "interest and debt expense" on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Critical Accounting Policies

In preparing the consolidated financial statements we have made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, Note 3 - Revenue Recognition and Note 20 - Leases to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Real Estate 

Real estate is carried at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renewals and certain costs directly related to the improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. For redevelopment of existing operating properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when complete. If the cost of the redeveloped property, including the net book value of the existing property, exceeds the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property, the excess is charged to expense. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives which range from 7 to 40 years. Tenant allowances are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate the useful lives of the assets.

Upon the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified intangibles, such as acquired above and below-market leases, acquired in-place leases and tenant relationships) and acquired liabilities and we allocate the purchase price based on these assessments which are on a relative fair value basis. We assess fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We amortize identified intangibles that have finite lives over the period they are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to the future cash flows of the property or business acquired.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amounts of real estate, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, were $10.1 billion and $13.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amounts of identified intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases, tenant relationships and acquired in-place leases) were $30,965,000 and $136,781,000, respectively, and the carrying amounts of identified intangible liabilities, a component of “deferred revenue” on our consolidated balance sheets, were $53,539,000 and $161,594,000, respectively.

Our properties, including any related right-of-use assets and intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, or market conditions change, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated discounted cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses.

Partially Owned Entities

We consolidate entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. In determining whether we have a controlling financial interest in a partially owned entity and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, we consider (i) whether the entity is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) in which we are the primary beneficiary or (ii) whether the entity is a voting interest entity in which we have a majority of the voting interests of the entity. We are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We generally do not control a partially owned entity if the approval of all of the partners/members is contractually required with respect to decisions that most significantly impact the performance of the partially owned entity. This includes decisions regarding operating/capital budgets, and the placement of new or additional financing secured by the assets of the venture, among others. We account for investments under the equity method when the requirements for consolidation are not met, and we have significant influence over the operations of the investee. Equity method investments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently adjusted for our share of net income or loss and cash contributions and distributions each period. Investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are accounted for under the cost method.

Critical Accounting Policies - continued

Partially Owned Entities - continued

Investments in partially owned entities are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recorded when there is a decline in the fair value below the carrying value and we conclude such decline is other-than-temporary. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the carrying amount of an investment over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses are based on current plans, intended holding periods and available information at the time the analyses are prepared. The ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned entities is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of each investment and market conditions. If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, the nature of development activities for properties for which such activities are planned and the estimated fair value of the investment change based on market conditions or otherwise, our evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on estimates and assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates, capital requirements, capitalization rates and discount rates that could differ materially from actual results.

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amounts of investments in partially owned entities were $4.0 billion and $0.9 billion, respectively.

Revenue Recognition

We have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies:

•Rental revenues include revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants, lease termination income, revenues from the Hotel Pennsylvania, trade shows and tenant services.

◦Revenues from the leasing of space at our properties to tenants includes (i) lease components, including fixed and variable lease payments, and nonlease components which include reimbursement of common area maintenance expenses, and (ii) reimbursement of real estate taxes and insurance expenses. As lessor, we have elected to combine the lease and nonlease components of our operating lease agreements and account for the components as a single lease component. Revenues derived from fixed lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable period of the lease, together with renewal options that are reasonably certain of being exercised. We commence rental revenue recognition when the underlying asset is available for use by the lessee. Revenue derived from the reimbursement of real estate taxes, insurance expenses and common area maintenance expenses are generally recognized in the same period as the related expenses are incurred. 

◦Lease termination income is recognized immediately if a tenant vacates or is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shortened remaining lease term.

◦Hotel revenue arising from the operation of Hotel Pennsylvania consists of room revenue, food and beverage revenue, and banquet revenue. Room revenue is recognized when the rooms are made available for the guest.

◦Trade shows revenue arising from the operation of trade shows is primarily booth rentals. This revenue is recognized upon the occurrence of the trade shows when the trade show booths are made available for use by the exhibitors.

◦Tenant services revenue arises from sub-metered electric, elevator, trash removal and other services provided to tenants at their request. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

•Fee and other income includes management, leasing and other revenue arising from contractual agreements with third parties or with partially owned entities and includes Building Maintenance Services LLC (“BMS”) cleaning, engineering and security services. This revenue is recognized as the services are transferred.

We assess, on an individual lease basis, whether it is probable that we will collect the future lease payments. We consider the tenant's payment history and current credit status when assessing collectability. When collectability is not deemed probable, we write off the tenant's receivables, including straight-line rent receivables, and limit lease income to cash received. Changes to the collectability of our operating leases are recorded as adjustments to "rental revenues" on our consolidated statements of income. If our assessment of the collectability of revenue changes, the impact on our consolidated financial statements could be material.

Income Taxes

Vornado operates in a manner intended to enable it to continue to qualify as a REIT under Sections 856‑860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under those sections, a REIT which distributes at least 90% of its REIT taxable income as a dividend to its shareholders each year and which meets certain other conditions will not be taxed on that portion of its taxable income which is distributed to its shareholders. Vornado distributes to its shareholders 100% of its REIT taxable income and therefore, no provision for Federal income taxes is required. If Vornado fails to distribute the required amount of income to its shareholders, or fails to meet other REIT requirements, it may fail to qualify as a REIT which may result in substantial adverse tax consequences.

NOI At Share by Segment for the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018

NOI at share represents total revenues less operating expenses including our share of partially owned entities. NOI at share - cash basis represents NOI at share adjusted to exclude straight-line rental income and expense, amortization of acquired below and above market leases, net and other non-cash adjustments. We consider NOI at share - cash basis to be the primary non-GAAP financial measure for making decisions and assessing the unlevered performance of our segments as it relates to the total return on assets as opposed to the levered return on equity. As properties are bought and sold based on NOI at share - cash basis, we utilize this measure to make investment decisions as well as to compare the performance of our assets to that of our peers. NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis should not be considered alternatives to net income or cash flow from operations and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.

Below is a summary of NOI at share and NOI at share - cash basis by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Related Party Transactions

See Note 23 - Related Party Transactions to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion concerning related party transactions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Rental revenue is our primary source of cash flow and is dependent upon the occupancy and rental rates of our properties. Our cash requirements include property operating expenses, capital improvements, tenant improvements, debt service, leasing commissions, dividends to shareholders and distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, as well as acquisition and development costs. Other sources of liquidity to fund cash requirements include proceeds from debt financings, including mortgage loans, senior unsecured borrowings, unsecured term loans and unsecured revolving credit facilities; proceeds from the issuance of common and preferred equity; and asset sales. 

We anticipate that cash flow from continuing operations over the next twelve months will be adequate to fund our business operations, cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership, cash dividends to shareholders, debt amortization and recurring capital expenditures. Capital requirements for development expenditures and acquisitions may require funding from borrowings and/or equity offerings.

We expect to generate net cash of approximately $2 billion resulting from the sales of 100% of the 220 CPS residential condominium units, including $1 billion of after-tax net gain, of which $569,901,000 was recognized in our consolidated statements of income from inception to December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019, 91% of the condominium units are sold or under sales contracts, with closings scheduled through 2020.

We may from time to time purchase or retire outstanding debt securities or redeem our equity securities. Such purchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Dividends

On December 18, 2019, Vornado's Board of Trustees declared a special dividend of $1.95 per share to common shareholders of record on December 30, 2019 (the "Record Date"). On January 15, 2020, $372,380,000 of cash was paid to Vornado's common shareholders and $25,912,000 of cash was paid to non-affiliated unitholders of the Operating Partnership for the special dividend.

On January 15, 2020, Vornado declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.66 per share (an indicated annual rate of $2.64 per common share). This dividend, if declared by the Board of Trustees for all of 2020, would require Vornado to pay out approximately $504,000,000 of cash for common share dividends. In addition, during 2020, Vornado expects to pay approximately $50,000,000 of cash dividends on outstanding preferred shares and approximately $35,000,000 of cash distributions to unitholders of the Operating Partnership.

Financing Activities and Contractual Obligations

We have an effective shelf registration for the offering of our equity and debt securities that is not limited in amount due to our status as a “well-known seasoned issuer.” We have issued senior unsecured notes from a shelf registration statement that contain financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur debt, and that require us to maintain a level of unencumbered assets based on the level of our secured debt. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. As of December 31, 2019, we are in compliance with all of the financial covenants required by our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured revolving credit facilities.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $1,515,012,000 of cash and cash equivalents and $2,159,120,000 of borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facilities, net of letters of credit of $15,880,000. A summary of our consolidated debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is presented below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our consolidated outstanding debt, net of deferred financing costs and other, was $7,406,609,000 at December 31, 2019, a $2,430,012,000 decrease from the balance at December 31, 2018. During 2020 and 2021, $450,000,000 and $2,326,516,000, respectively, of our outstanding debt matures; we may refinance this maturing debt as it comes due or choose to repay it using cash and cash equivalents or our unsecured revolving credit facilities. We may also refinance or prepay other outstanding debt depending on prevailing market conditions, liquidity requirements and other factors. The amounts involved in connection with these transactions could be material to our consolidated financial statements.

Below is a schedule of our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2019.

Preferred Securities

On January 4 and 11, 2018, we redeemed all of the outstanding 6.625% Series G and Series I cumulative redeemable preferred shares/ units at their redemption price of $25.00 per share/unit, or $470,000,000 in the aggregate, plus accrued and unpaid dividends/distributions through the date of redemption, and expensed $14,486,000 of previously capitalized issuance costs.

Unsecured Term Loan

On October 26, 2018, we extended our $750,000,000 unsecured term loan from October 2020 to February 2024. The interest rate on the extended unsecured term loan was lowered from LIBOR plus 1.15% to LIBOR plus 1.00%. In connection with the extension of our unsecured term loan, we entered into an interest rate swap from LIBOR plus 1.00% to a fixed rate of 3.87% through October 2023.

Secured Debt

On January 5, 2018, we completed a $100,000,000 refinancing of 33-00 Northern Boulevard (Center Building), a 471,000 square foot office building in Long Island City, New York. The seven-year loan is at LIBOR plus 1.80%, which was swapped to a fixed rate of 4.14%. We realized net proceeds of approximately $37,200,000 after repayment of the existing 4.43% $59,800,000 mortgage and closing costs.

On April 19, 2018, the joint venture between the Fund and the Crowne Plaza Joint Venture completed a $255,000,000 refinancing of the Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel. The interest-only loan is at LIBOR plus 3.53% and matures in May 2020 with three one-year extension options. In connection therewith, the joint venture purchased an interest rate cap that caps LIBOR at a rate of 4.00%. The Crowne Plaza Times Square Hotel was previously encumbered by a $310,000,000 interest-only mortgage at LIBOR plus 2.80%, which was scheduled to mature in December 2018.

On June 11, 2018, the joint venture that owns Independence Plaza, a three-building 1,327-unit Manhattan residential complex completed a $675,000,000 refinancing of Independence Plaza. The seven-year interest-only loan matures in July 2025 and has a fixed rate of 4.25%. Our share of net proceeds, after repayment of the existing 3.48% $550,000,000 mortgage and closing costs, was $55,618,000.

On August 9, 2018, we completed a $120,000,000 refinancing of 4 Union Square South, a 206,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.40% and matures in 2025, as extended. The property was previously encumbered by a $113,000,000 mortgage at LIBOR plus 2.15%, which was scheduled to mature in 2019.

On November 16, 2018, we completed a $205,000,000 refinancing of 150 West 34th Street, a 78,000 square foot Manhattan retail property. The interest-only loan carries a rate of LIBOR plus 1.88% and matures in 2024, as extended. Concurrently, we invested $105,000,000 in a participation in the refinanced mortgage loan, which earns interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 2.00% and also matures in 2024, as extended, and is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. The property was previously encumbered by a mortgage of the same amount at LIBOR plus 2.25%, which was scheduled to mature in 2020.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off‑balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures. All debt of our joint venture arrangements is non-recourse to us except for the mortgage loans secured by 640 Fifth Avenue and 7 West 34th Street, which we guaranteed and therefore are part of our tax basis. Our off-balance sheet arrangements are discussed in Note 6 - Investments in Partially Owned Entities and Note 22 - Commitments and Contingencies in our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Certain Future Cash Requirements

Capital Expenditures

The following table summarizes anticipated 2020 capital expenditures.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table above excludes anticipated capital expenditures of each of our partially owned non-consolidated subsidiaries, as these entities fund their capital expenditures without additional equity contributions from us.

Development and Redevelopment Expenditures 

220 CPS

We are constructing a residential condominium tower containing 397,000 salable square feet at 220 CPS. The development cost of this project (exclusive of land cost of $515.4 million) is estimated to be approximately $1.450 billion, of which $1.373 billion has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

Penn District

We are redeveloping PENN1, a 2,545,000 square foot office building located on 34th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenue. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $325,000,000, of which $69,006,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019. 

We are redeveloping PENN2, a 1,795,000 square foot (as expanded) office building, located on the west side of Seventh Avenue between 31st and 33rd Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be $750,000,000, of which $40,820,000 has been expended as of December 31, 2019.

The joint venture has entered into a development agreement with ESD to build the adjacent Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture's obligations. The joint venture has entered into a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders pursuant to which they will build the Moynihan Train Hall, thereby fulfilling all of the joint venture's obligations to ESD. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. The development expenditures for the Moynihan Train Hall are estimated to be approximately $1.6 billion, which will be funded by governmental agencies. 

On December 19, 2019, we paid Kmart Corporation $34,000,000, of which $10,000,000 is expected to be reimbursed, to early terminate their 141,000 square foot retail space lease at PENN1 which was scheduled to expire in January 2036.

We are redeveloping a 78,000 square foot Class A office building at 345 Montgomery Street, a part of our 555 California Street complex in San Francisco (70.0% interest) located at the corner of California and Pine Street. The development cost of this project is estimated to be approximately $50,000,000, of which our share is $35,000,000. As of December 31, 2019, $48,087,000 has been expended, of which our share is $33,661,000.

We are also evaluating other development and redevelopment opportunities at certain of our properties in Manhattan including, in particular, the Penn District.

There can be no assurance that the above projects will be completed, completed on schedule or within budget.

Insurance

For our properties except the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of $300,000,000 per occurrence and per property, and all risk property and rental value insurance with limits of $2.0 billion per occurrence, with sub-limits for certain perils such as flood and earthquake. Our California properties have earthquake insurance with coverage of $350,000,000 per occurrence and in the aggregate, subject to a deductible in the amount of 5% of the value of the affected property. We maintain coverage for certified terrorism acts with limits of $6.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate (as listed below), $1.2 billion for non-certified acts of terrorism, and $5.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate for terrorism involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological (“NBCR”) terrorism events, as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, as amended to date and which has been extended through December 2027.  

Penn Plaza Insurance Company, LLC (“PPIC”), our wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, acts as a re-insurer with respect to a portion of all risk property and rental value insurance and a portion of our earthquake insurance coverage, and as a direct insurer for coverage for acts of terrorism including NBCR acts. Coverage for acts of terrorism (excluding NBCR acts) is fully reinsured by third party insurance companies and the Federal government with no exposure to PPIC. For NBCR acts, PPIC is responsible for a deductible of $1,430,413 and 20% of the balance of a covered loss and the Federal government is responsible for the remaining portion of a covered loss. We are ultimately responsible for any loss incurred by PPIC.  

For the Farley Office and Retail Building, we maintain general liability insurance with limits of $100,000,000 per occurrence, and builder’s risk insurance including coverage for existing property and development activities of $2.8 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate. We maintain coverage for certified and non-certified terrorism acts with limits of $1.0 billion per occurrence and in the aggregate.

We continue to monitor the state of the insurance market and the scope and costs of coverage for acts of terrorism and other events. However, we cannot anticipate what coverage will be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future. We are responsible for uninsured losses and for deductibles and losses in excess of our insurance coverage, which could be material. 

Our debt instruments, consisting of mortgage loans secured by our properties, senior unsecured notes and revolving credit agreements contain customary covenants requiring us to maintain insurance. Although we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for purposes of these agreements, we may not be able to obtain an equivalent amount of coverage at reasonable costs in the future. Further, if lenders insist on greater coverage than we are able to obtain it could adversely affect our ability to finance or refinance our properties and expand our portfolio.

Other Commitments and Contingencies

We are from time to time involved in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In our opinion, after consultation with legal counsel, the outcome of such matters is not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Each of our properties has been subjected to varying degrees of environmental assessment at various times. The environmental assessments did not reveal any material environmental contamination. However, there can be no assurance that the identification of new areas of contamination, changes in the extent or known scope of contamination, the discovery of additional sites, or changes in cleanup requirements would not result in significant costs to us. 

In July 2018, we leased 78,000 square feet at 345 Montgomery Street in San Francisco, CA, to a subsidiary of Regus PLC, for an initial term of 15 years. The obligations under the lease were guaranteed by Regus PLC in an amount of up to $90,000,000. The tenant purported to terminate the lease prior to space delivery. We commenced a suit on October 23, 2019 seeking to enforce the lease and the guarantee.  

Our mortgage loans are non-recourse to us, except for the mortgage loans secured by 640 Fifth Avenue, 7 West 34th Street and 435 Seventh Avenue, which we guaranteed and therefore are part of our tax basis. In certain cases we have provided guarantees or master leased tenant space. These guarantees and master leases terminate either upon the satisfaction of specified circumstances or repayment of the underlying loans. In addition, we have guaranteed the rent and payments in lieu of real estate taxes due to ESD, an entity of New York State, for the Farley Office and Retail Building. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate dollar amount of these guarantees and master leases is approximately $1,524,000,000. 

As of December 31, 2019, $15,880,000 of letters of credit were outstanding under one of our unsecured revolving credit facilities. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum interest coverage and maximum debt to market capitalization ratios, and provide for higher interest rates in the event of a decline in our ratings below Baa3/BBB. Our unsecured revolving credit facilities also contain customary conditions precedent to borrowing, including representations and warranties, and also contain customary events of default that could give rise to accelerated repayment, including such items as failure to pay interest or principal. 

The joint venture in which we own a 95.0% ownership interest was designated by ESD to develop the Farley Office and Retail Building. The joint venture entered into a development agreement with ESD and a design-build contract with Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders. Under the development agreement with ESD, the joint venture is obligated to build the Moynihan Train Hall, with Vornado and Related each guaranteeing the joint venture’s obligations. Under the design-build agreement, Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders is obligated to fulfill all of the joint venture’s obligations. The obligations of Skanska Moynihan Train Hall Builders have been bonded by Skanska USA and bear a full guaranty from Skanska AB. 

As of December 31, 2019, we expect to fund additional capital to certain of our partially owned entities aggregating approximately $12,700,000.

As of December 31, 2019, we have construction commitments aggregating approximately $627,000,000.

Funds From Operations

Vornado Realty Trust

FFO is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”). NAREIT defines FFO as GAAP net income or loss adjusted to exclude net gains from sales of depreciable real estate assets, real estate impairment losses, depreciation and amortization expense from real estate assets and other specified items, including the pro rata share of such adjustments of unconsolidated subsidiaries. FFO and FFO per diluted share are non-GAAP financial measures used by management, investors and analysts to facilitate meaningful comparisons of operating performance between periods and among our peers because it excludes the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization and net gains on sales, which are based on historical costs and implicitly assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time, rather than fluctuating based on existing market conditions. FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash requirements and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a performance measure or cash flow as a liquidity measure. FFO may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The calculations of both the numerator and denominator used in the computation of income per share are disclosed in Note 19 – Income Per Share/Income Per Class A Unit, in our consolidated financial statements on page 130 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
