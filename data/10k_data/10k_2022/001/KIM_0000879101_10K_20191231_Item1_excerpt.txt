Overview 

Kimco Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, is one of North America’s largest publicly traded owners and operators of open-air shopping centers. The terms “Kimco,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” each refer to Kimco Realty Corporation and our subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. In statements regarding qualification as a real estate investment trust ("REIT"), such terms refer solely to Kimco Realty Corporation. The Company’s mission is to create destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. 

The Company is a self-administered REIT and has owned and operated open-air shopping centers for over 60 years. The Company has not engaged, nor does it expect to retain, any REIT advisors in connection with the operation of its properties. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had interests in 409 shopping center properties (the “Combined Shopping Center Portfolio”), aggregating 72.4 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”), located in 27 states and Puerto Rico. In addition, the Company had 243 other property interests, primarily through the Company’s preferred equity investments and other real estate investments, totaling 3.9 million square feet of GLA. The Company’s ownership interests in real estate consist of its consolidated portfolio and portfolios where the Company owns an economic interest, such as properties in the Company’s investment real estate management programs, where the Company partners with institutional investors and also retains management.  

The Company's executive offices are located at 500 North Broadway, Suite 201, Jericho, NY 11753, a mixed-use property that is wholly owned by the Company, and its telephone number is (516) 869-9000. Nearly all operating functions, including leasing, legal, construction, data processing, maintenance, finance and accounting are administered by the Company from its executive offices in Jericho, New York and supported by the Company’s regional offices.

The Company began operations through its predecessor, The Kimco Corporation, which was organized in 1966 upon the contribution of several shopping center properties owned by its principal stockholders. In 1973, these principals formed the Company as a Delaware corporation, and, in 1985, the operations of The Kimco Corporation were merged into the Company. The Company completed its initial public stock offering (the “IPO”) in November 1991, and, commencing with its taxable year which began January 1, 1992, elected to qualify as a REIT in accordance with Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). If, as the Company believes, it is organized and operates in such a manner so as to qualify and remain qualified as a REIT under the Code, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax, provided that distributions to its stockholders equal at least the amount of its REIT taxable income, as defined in the Code. The Company maintains certain subsidiaries that made joint elections with the Company to be treated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), that permit the Company to engage through such TRSs in certain business activities that the REIT may not conduct directly. A TRS is subject to federal and state taxes on its income, and the Company includes a provision for taxes in its consolidated financial statements. In 1994, the Company reorganized as a Maryland corporation. In March 2006, the Company was added to the S & P 500 Index, an index containing the stock of 500 Large Cap companies, most of which are U.S. corporations. The Company's common stock, Class L Depositary Shares and Class M Depositary Shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the trading symbols “KIM”, “KIMprL”, and “KIMprM”, respectively. 

The Company began to expand its operations through the development of real estate and the construction of shopping centers, but revised its growth strategy to focus on the acquisition of existing shopping centers. The Company also expanded internationally within Canada, Mexico, Chile, Brazil and Peru, but has since substantially liquidated its investments in Mexico and has completely exited Canada, Chile, Brazil and Peru. More recently the Company, on a selective basis, has embarked on several ground-up development and re-development projects which include residential and mixed-use components. 

The Company implemented its investment real estate management format through the establishment of various institutional joint venture programs, in which the Company has noncontrolling interests. The Company earns management fees, acquisition fees, disposition fees as well as promoted interests based on achieving certain performance metrics. 

In addition, the Company has capitalized on its established expertise in retail real estate by establishing other ventures in which the Company owns a smaller equity interest and provides management, leasing and operational support for those properties. The Company has also provided preferred equity capital in the past to real estate entrepreneurs and, from time to time, provides real estate capital and management services to both healthy and distressed retailers. The Company has also made selective investments in secondary market opportunities where a security or other investment is, in management’s judgment, priced below the value of the underlying assets, however these investments are subject to volatility within the equity and debt markets. 

Business Objective and Strategies 

Strategy Overview 

The Company’s strategy is to continue to focus on its three core principles: 

1)   

Portfolio Quality - improving the quality and locations of its portfolio by maintaining high quality assets, tightly clustered in major metro markets that provide multiple growth levers.     

2)   

Net Asset Value Creation - harvesting the unrealized value in its portfolio through a curated collection of mixed-use projects, and     

3)   

Financial Strength - maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity and financial flexibility.     

Over the past several years, the Company has transformed its portfolio, focusing on major metropolitan-area U.S. markets, predominantly on the East and West coasts and in the Sunbelt region, which are supported by strong demographics, significant projected population growth, and where the Company perceives significant barriers to entry. As of December 31, 2019, the Company derived 84.4% of its annualized base rent from its top major metro markets. 

The Company’s focus on high-quality locations has led to significant opportunities for value creation through the reinvestment in its assets to add density, replace outdated shopping center concepts, and better meet changing consumer demands. The Company continues to place strategic emphasis on live/work/play environments and in reinvesting in its existing assets, while building shareholder value. This philosophy is further exemplified by the Company’s Signature SeriesTM properties Dania Pointe, Grand Parkway Marketplace, Kentlands Market Square, Lincoln Square, Mill Station, Pentagon Centre, Suburban Square and The Boulevard. 

The strength and security of the Company’s balance sheet remains central to its strategy. The Company’s strong balance sheet and liquidity position are evidenced by its investment grade unsecured debt ratings (Baa1/BBB+/BBB+) by all three major ratings agencies. The Company maintains one of the longest average debt maturity profiles in the REIT industry, now at 10.6 years. The Company has taken meaningful steps to reduce leverage, unencumber assets and further improve its debt coverage metrics as redevelopment and development projects continue to come online and contribute additional cash flow growth.

Business Objective 

The Company’s primary business objective is to be the premier owner and operator of open-air shopping centers in the U.S. The Company believes it can achieve this objective by: 

●   

increasing the value of its existing portfolio of properties and generating higher levels of portfolio growth;     

●   

increasing cash flows for reinvestment and/or for distribution to shareholders;     

●   

continuing growth in desirable demographic areas with successful retailers; and     

●   

increasing capital appreciation.     

Operating Strategies 

The Company’s operating strategies are to (i) own and operate its shopping center properties at their highest potential through maximizing and maintaining rental income and occupancy levels, (ii) attract local area customers to its shopping centers, which offer buy online and pick up in store, off-price merchandise and day-to-day necessities rather than high-priced luxury items, and (iii) maintain a strong balance sheet. 

To effectively execute these strategies the Company seeks to: 

●   

increase rental rates where possible through the leasing of space to new tenants;     

●   

attract a diverse and robust tenant base across a variety of retailers at its properties, which include grocery store, off-price retailers, discounters, or service-oriented tenants;     

●   

renew leases with existing tenants;     

●   

decrease vacancy levels and duration of vacancy;     

●   

monitor operating costs and overhead;     

●   

redevelop existing shopping centers to obtain the highest and best use to maximize the real estate value;     

●   

provide unmatched tenant services deriving from decades of experience managing retail properties; and     

●   

provide communities with a destination for everyday living goods and services.     

The Company reduces its operating and leasing risks through diversification achieved by the geographic distribution of its properties and a large tenant base. As of December 31, 2019, no single open-air shopping center accounted for more than 1.9% of the Company's annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest, or more than 1.9% of the Company’s total shopping center GLA. Furthermore, at December 31, 2019, the Company’s single largest tenant represented only 3.9%, and the Company’s five largest tenants aggregated less than 12.4%, of the Company’s annualized base rental revenues, including the proportionate share of base rental revenues from properties in which the Company has less than a 100% economic interest. 

As one of the original participants in the growth of the shopping center industry and one of the nation's largest owners and operators of open-air shopping centers, the Company has established close relationships with major national and regional retailers and maintains a broad network of industry contacts. Management is associated with and/or actively participates in many shopping center and REIT industry organizations. Notwithstanding these relationships, there are numerous regional and local commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors who compete with the Company for the acquisition of properties and other investment opportunities and in seeking tenants who will lease space in the Company’s properties. 

Investment Strategies 

The Company’s investment strategy is to invest capital into its high-quality assets which are tightly clustered in major metro markets that provide opportunity for growth while disposing of lesser quality assets in less desirable locations. Through this strategy, the Company has transformed its portfolio and will continue these efforts as deemed necessary to maximize the quality and growth of its portfolio. Property acquisitions are focused in major metro areas allowing tenants to generate higher foot traffic resulting in higher sales volume accompanied with a potential for a mixed use component. The Company believes that this will enable it to maintain higher occupancy levels, rental rates and rental growth. 

The Company’s investment strategy also includes the retail re-tenanting, renovation and expansion of its existing centers and acquired centers, while also pursuing redevelopment opportunities to increase overall value within its portfolio. The Company may selectively acquire established income-producing real estate properties and properties requiring significant re-tenanting and redevelopment, primarily in geographic regions in which the Company presently operates. Additionally, the Company may selectively acquire land parcels in its key markets for real estate development projects for long-term investment. The Company may consider investments in other real estate sectors and in geographic markets where it does not presently operate should suitable opportunities arise. The Company also continues to simplify its business by reducing the number of joint venture investments.

As part of the Company’s investment strategy each property is evaluated for its highest and best use, which may include residential and mixed-use components. In addition, the Company may consider other opportunistic investments related to retailer controlled real estate such as repositioning underperforming retail locations, retail real estate financing and bankruptcy transaction support. The Company has a capital recycling program which provides for the disposition of certain lesser quality assets. If the estimated fair value for any of these assets is less than their net carrying values, the Company would be required to take impairment charges and such amounts could be material. 

The Company may either purchase or lease income-producing properties in the future and may also participate with other entities in property ownership through partnerships, joint ventures or similar types of co-ownership. Equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and/or other indebtedness. Financing or other indebtedness may be incurred simultaneously or subsequently in connection with such investments. Any such financing or indebtedness would have priority over the Company’s equity interest in such property. 

Environment, Social, Governance ("ESG") Program 

The Company is focused on building a thriving and viable business, one that succeeds by delivering long-term value for its stakeholders. The Company's ESG programs are aligned with its core business strategy of creating destinations for everyday living that inspire a sense of community and deliver value to our many stakeholders. 

The Company has established four ESG Program Pillars: 

●   

Embrace the Future of Retail - foster a sense of place at our shopping centers, creating people-centered properties that are more convenient and accessible     

●   

Engage Our Local Communities - make a positive impact and be known in the communities where we operate and live     

●   

Lead in Operations & Resiliency - maximize efficiency of operations and protect our assets from disruption by climate, security and other disruptions     

●   

Foster an Engaged, Inclusive & Ethical Team - cultivate high levels of employee satisfaction and improve diversity of management     

Detailed information on ESG program governance and performance can be found on the Company's website in the Corporate Responsibility Report. This report is based on the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standard, which summarizes environmental and social performance. 

During 2019, the Company was recognized for its commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance principles. The Company was cited by the Global Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark earning the distinguished Green Star designation for a sixth consecutive year. In addition, the Company was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fifth consecutive year. Also in 2019, the Company was named for the first time to the Russell “FTSE4Good” Index Series, received one of the leading ESG scores for the real estate industry from Institutional Investor Services (ISS) and was presented with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") Leader in the Light Award, a top honor among the Company’s peers.
