Item 1A. Risk Factors

The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating our business and the forward-looking statements contained within this report. The occurrence of one or more of the circumstances or events described below could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may occur or become material and may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 

A substantial portion of our revenue and gross profit is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers and the loss of any of these customers or significant financial difficulties in their businesses could substantially reduce our revenue.

A few of our customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 18.4% of our revenue in 2019 and 18.9% of our revenue in each of 2018 and 2017. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2019, 2018 or 2017. Collectively, Macy’s, Inc. (“Macy’s”) and J. C. Penney Corporation, Inc. (“J. C. Penney”), two of our ten largest customers in 2019, have closed approximately 275 stores since 2016 and Macy’s announced plans to close 125 additional stores over the next three years. These store closings have resulted and may continue to result in a decrease in the total amount of purchases made by Macy’s and J. C. Penney. A continued decline in purchases made over the next several years could have a materially adverse effect on our United States wholesale business. 

We had an agreement with Macy’s pursuant to which Macy’s was the exclusive department store distributor in the United States of men’s sportswear under the TOMMY HILFIGER brand; G-III, a licensee of the TOMMY HILFIGER brand, had a similar arrangement with Macy’s for women’s sportswear under the TOMMY HILFIGER brand. As a result of these strategic alliances, the success of Tommy Hilfiger’s North American men’s wholesale business and its licensed women’s wholesale business with G-III were substantially dependent on these relationships and on the ability of Macy’s to maintain and increase sales of TOMMY HILFIGER products. Both exclusive arrangements were terminated effective for the Spring 2019 selling season. We cannot assure you that Macy’s will continue to order the same volume of TOMMY HILFIGER products from us, G-III or our other TOMMY HILFIGER licensees, or that other department stores will purchase TOMMY HILFIGER products in sufficient volume to offset any reduction in sales to Macy’s in the future. This could result in a decline in overall revenue and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

We do not have long-term agreements with any of our customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. A decision by any of our major customers, whether motivated by marketing strategy, competitive conditions, financial difficulties or otherwise, to decrease significantly the amount of merchandise purchased from us or our licensing or other partners, or to change their manner of doing business with us or our licensing or other partners, could substantially reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our profitability. The retail industry’s recent history has seen a great deal of consolidation, particularly in the United States, and other ownership changes, as well as management changes and store closing programs, and we expect such changes to be ongoing. Store closing programs, such as those described above, decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In the future, retailers may further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores’ target markets or marketing strategies. Any of these types of actions could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the ownership concentration within the retail industry. These changes could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our customers. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may not be able to continue to develop and grow our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.

A significant portion of our business strategy involves growing our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses. Our achievement of revenue and profitability growth from Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein will depend largely upon our ability to:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•continue to maintain good working relationships with Tommy Hilfiger’s and Calvin Klein’s licensees;[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 17

•continue to strengthen and expand the Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses.

We cannot assure you that we can successfully execute any of these actions or our growth strategy for these businesses, nor can we assure you that the launch of any additional product lines or businesses by us or our licensees or that the continued offering of these lines will achieve the degree of consistent success necessary to generate profits or positive cash flow. Our ability to successfully carry out our growth strategy may be affected by, among other things, our ability to enhance our relationships with existing customers to obtain additional selling space or add additional product lines, our ability to develop new relationships with retailers, economic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer tastes and style trends. If we fail to continue to develop and grow the Tommy Hilfiger or Calvin Klein business, our financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

The success of our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses depends on the value of our “TOMMY HILFIGER” and “CALVIN KLEIN” brands and, if the value of either of those brands were to diminish, our business could be adversely affected.

Our success depends on our brands and their value. The TOMMY HILFIGER name is integral to the existing Tommy Hilfiger business, as well as to our strategies for continuing to grow and expand the business. Mr. Hilfiger, who remains active in the business, is closely identified with the TOMMY HILFIGER brand and any negative perception with respect to Mr. Hilfiger could adversely affect the TOMMY HILFIGER brands. In addition, under Mr. Hilfiger’s employment agreement, if his employment is terminated for any reason, his agreement not to compete with the Tommy Hilfiger business will expire two years after such termination. Although Mr. Hilfiger could not use any TOMMY HILFIGER trademark in connection with a competitive business, his association with a competitive business could adversely affect the Tommy Hilfiger business. We also have exposure with respect to the CALVIN KLEIN brands, which are integral to the existing Calvin Klein business and could be adversely affected if Mr. Klein’s public image or reputation were to be tarnished.

Our business is heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop.

Reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, whether in our own retail stores or in the stores of our wholesale customers, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Reductions could result from economic conditions, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks. Disease epidemics and other health-related concerns, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, also could result in (and, in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, has resulted in) closed stores, reduced consumer traffic and purchasing, as consumers become ill or limit or cease shopping in order to avoid exposure, or governments impose mandatory business closures, travel restrictions or the like to prevent the spread of disease. Additionally, political or civil unrests and demonstrations also could affect consumer traffic and purchasing, as was the case with the recent protests in Hong Kong SAR.

Our U.S. retail store operations are a material contributor to our revenue and earnings. The majority of our United States retail stores are located away from major residential centers or near vacation destinations, making travel a critical factor in their success. These retail businesses historically also have had a significant portion of their revenue and earnings attributable to sales to international tourists. In addition to the factors discussed above, international tourism to the United States could be reduced, as could the extent to which international tourists shop at our retail stores, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly the euro, the Brazilian real, the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, the Korean won and the Chinese yuan renminbi. A reduction in international tourist traffic or spending therefore could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In fact in 2019, we did experience a significant decrease in sales to international tourists, which we believe was attributable in part to the strength of the United States dollar and which negatively impacted sales and earnings for our Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger retail businesses in the United States.

Other factors that could affect the success of our stores include: 

•the location of the store or mall, including the location of a particular store within the mall;

•the other tenants occupying space at the mall;

•increased competition in areas where the stores are located;

•the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the store or mall;

•the changing patterns of consumer shopping behavior;

•increased competition from online retailers; and

 18

•the diversion of sales from our retail stores due to our digital commerce sites.

Acquisitions may not be successful in achieving intended benefits, cost savings and synergies.

One component of our growth strategy has been to make acquisitions, such as the Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein and Warnaco acquisitions. Prior to completing any acquisition, our management team identifies expected synergies, cost savings and growth opportunities but, due to legal and business limitations, we may not have access to all necessary information. The integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The potential difficulties of integrating the operations of an acquired business and realizing our expectations for an acquisition, including the benefits that may be realized, include, among other things:

•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business;

•delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

•higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

•unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, information, communications and other systems;

•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations affecting the acquired business;

•unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators;

•retaining key customers, suppliers and employees;

•retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;

•operating risks inherent in the acquired business;

•diversion of the attention and resources of management;

•consumers’ failure to accept product offerings by us or our licensees;

•assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence;

•the impact on our or an acquired business’ internal controls and compliance with the requirements under applicable regulation; and

•other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities.

We have completed acquisitions that have not performed as well as initially expected and cannot assure you that any acquisition will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Future economic conditions, including volatility in the financial and credit markets may adversely affect our business.

Economic conditions in the past have adversely affected, and in the future may adversely affect, our business, our customers and licensees and their businesses, and our financing and other contractual arrangements, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak. Such conditions, among other things, have resulted, and in the future may result, in financial difficulties leading to restructurings, bankruptcies, liquidations and other unfavorable events for our customers and licensees, may cause such customers to reduce or discontinue orders of our products and licensed products sold by our licensees, and may result in customers being unable to pay us for products they have purchased from us and licensees being unable to pay us for royalties owed to us. Financial difficulties of customers and licensees may also affect the ability of our customers and licensees to access credit markets or lead to higher credit risk relating to receivables from customers and licensees.

Future volatility in the financial and credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the current COVID-19 outbreak, could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing or refinance existing debt when the need arises, including upon maturity, which for our senior unsecured credit facilities is currently scheduled for April 2024, or on terms that would be acceptable to us. 

 19

Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and control regulations.

Our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein businesses each have substantial international components that expose us to significant foreign exchange risk. Our Heritage Brands business also has international components but those components are not significant to the business. Changes in exchange rates between the United States dollar and other currencies can impact our financial results in two ways: a translational impact and a transactional impact. 

The translational impact refers to the impact that changes in exchange rates can have on our results of operations and financial position. The functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are generally the applicable local currencies. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in United States dollars. The results of operations in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using an average exchange rate over the representative period and our assets and liabilities in local foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars using the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences that arise from the translation of our foreign subsidiaries’ assets and liabilities into United States dollars are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments in other comprehensive (loss) income. Accordingly, our results of operations and other comprehensive (loss) income will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar, particularly against the euro, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Korean won, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese yuan renminbi, and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar against those currencies.

A transactional impact on financial results is common for apparel companies operating outside the United States that purchase goods in United States dollars, as is the case with most of our foreign operations. As with translation, our results of operations will be unfavorably impacted during times of a strengthening United States dollar as the increased local currency value of inventory results in a higher cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold and favorably impacted during times of a weakening United States dollar as the decreased local currency value of inventory results in a lower cost of goods in local currency when the goods are sold. We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to certain intercompany transactions and selling, general and administrative (commonly referred to as “SG&A”) expenses. We currently use and plan to continue to use foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the cash flow or market value risks associated with these inventory and intercompany transactions, but we are unable to entirely eliminate these risks. 

We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk in connection with our licensing businesses. Most of our licensing agreements require the licensee to report sales to us in the licensee’s local currency but to pay us in United States dollars based on the exchange rate as of the last day of the contractual selling period. Thus, while we are not generally exposed to exchange rate gains and losses between the end of the selling period and the date we collect payment, we are exposed to changes in exchange rates during and up to the last day of the selling period. In addition, certain of our other foreign licensing agreements expose us to changes in exchange rates up to the date we collect payment or convert local currency payments into United States dollars. As a result, during times of a strengthening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be negatively impacted, and during times of a weakening United States dollar, our foreign royalty revenue will be favorably impacted.

We also have exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to our €950 million aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes. During times of a strengthening United States dollar against the euro, we could be required to use a lower amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on our euro-denominated senior notes, whereas during times of a weakening United States dollar against the euro, we could be required to use a greater amount of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and make long-term debt repayments on these notes.

We conduct business, directly or through licensees and other partners, in countries that are or have been subject to exchange rate control regulations and have, as a result, experienced difficulties in receiving payments owed to us when due, with amounts left unpaid for extended periods of time. Although the amounts to date have been immaterial to our results, as our international businesses grow and if controls are enacted or enforced in additional countries, there can be no assurance that such controls would not have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

 20

Our level of debt could impair our financial condition and ability to operate.

We had outstanding as of February 2, 2020 an aggregate principal amount of $2.725 billion of indebtedness under our senior unsecured credit facilities, our senior unsecured notes and our unsecured debentures. In March 2020, we increased our aggregate borrowings outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, other short-term revolving credit facilities and unsecured commercial paper note program from $50 million at February 2, 2020 to approximately $930 million, in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in responding to the impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. Our level of debt could have important consequences to investors, including:

•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be used for the payment of interest on our debt, thereby reducing the funds available to us for our operations or other capital needs;

•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate because our available cash flow after paying principal and interest on our debt may not be sufficient to make the capital and other expenditures necessary to address these changes;

•increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions because, during periods in which we experience lower earnings and cash flow, such as during the current COVID-19 outbreak, we will be required to devote a proportionally greater amount of our cash flow to paying principal and interest on our debt;

•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, contributions to our pension plans and general corporate requirements;

•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to other relatively less leveraged competitors that have more cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments, contributions to pension plans and general corporate requirements; and

•with respect to any borrowings we make at variable interest rates, including under our senior unsecured credit facilities, leaving us vulnerable to increases in interest rates to the extent the borrowings are not subject to an interest rate swap agreement.

In addition, our interest rate swap agreements as well as a portion of the borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facilities that have variable interest rates are tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021, or whether different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will develop. We cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, which could include an increase in interest expense and may also require the amendment of contracts that reference LIBOR.

We primarily use foreign suppliers for our products and raw materials, which poses risks to our business operations.

The majority of our apparel, footwear and accessories are produced by and purchased or procured from independent manufacturers located in countries in Asia, South America, Europe, the Middle East, North America, Africa, Central America and the Caribbean. Although no single supplier or country is or is expected to become critical to our production needs, any of the following could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations:

•political or labor instability or military conflict involving any of the countries in which we, our contractors, or our suppliers operate, which could cause a delay in the transportation of our products and raw materials to us and an increase in transportation costs;

•heightened terrorism security concerns, which could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more thorough inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundments of goods for extended periods or could result in decreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to lost sales, increased costs for our anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of our brands;

•a significant decrease in availability or increase in cost of raw materials, including commodities (particularly cotton), or the ability to use raw materials produced in a country that is a major provider due to political, human rights, labor, environmental, animal cruelty or other concerns 

•a significant decrease in factory and shipping capacity or increase in demand for such capacity;

•a significant increase in wage and shipping costs;

 21

•natural disasters, which could result in closed factories and scarcity of raw materials;

•disease epidemics and health related concerns, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, which could result in (and in the case of the COVID-19 outbreak, has resulted in certain of the following) closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargoing of goods produced in infected areas;

•migration and development of manufacturers, which could affect where our products are or are planned to be produced;

•imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations, which, among other things, could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the labor and expertise needed; and

•imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports.

The United States government imposed tariffs in 2019 and 2018 on a variety of imports from China into the United States, including certain categories of apparel, footwear and accessories. These additional tariffs, which were included in a trade agreement signed by the United States and China in January 2020, are not expected to be decreased, at least not in the near term, and in the future the United States could impose additional tariffs or increase existing tariffs on goods imported from China into the United States. China is the largest sourcing country of apparel, footwear and accessories for us globally and for most of our licensees. We imported approximately $215 million of inventory into the United States from China in 2019. Accordingly, any tariffs on apparel, footwear and accessories imported from China into the United States result in an increase in our cost of goods sold for that product. We are looking at alternative sourcing options but we may not be able to shift production of inventory bound for the United States from China to other countries. In addition, higher costs in sourcing from other countries, including because others in the industry are looking to move production for the same reason, may make the move price-prohibitive. We may not be able to pass the entire cost increase resulting from the tariffs onto consumers or could choose not to. Any increase in prices to consumers could have an adverse impact on our direct sales to consumers, as well as sales by our wholesale customers and our licensees. Any adverse impact on such sales or increase in our cost of goods sold could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

If our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees, or our licensees themselves fail to use legal and ethical business practices, our business could suffer.

We require our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees and the licensees themselves to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. Additionally, we impose upon our business partners operating guidelines that require additional obligations in those areas in order to promote ethical business practices. We audit, or have third parties audit, the operations of these independent parties to determine compliance. We were a member of the Accord on Fire and Building Safety in Bangladesh and are a member of its successor, the mission of each of which is to improve fire and building safety in Bangladesh’s apparel factories. We also collaborate with factories, suppliers, industry participants and other engaged stakeholders to improve the lives of our factory workers and others in our sourcing communities. However, we do not control our manufacturers, the manufacturers used by our licensees, or our licensees themselves, or their labor, manufacturing and other business practices. 

If any of these manufacturers or licensees violates labor, environmental, building and fire safety, or other laws or implements labor, manufacturing or other business practices that are generally regarded as unethical, the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted, orders could be canceled and relationships could be terminated. Further, we could be prohibited from importing goods by governmental authorities. In addition, we could be the focus of adverse publicity and our reputation could be damaged. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.

We are dependent on third parties to source and manufacture our products and any disruption in our relationships with these parties or in their businesses may materially adversely affect our businesses.

 We rely upon independent third parties for the manufacturing of the vast majority of our apparel, footwear and accessories. A manufacturer’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner, which has occurred, and may occur in the future, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, or to meet required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those products. As a result, customers could cancel their orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices. Any of these actions taken by our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and, consequently, our results of operations.

 22

We use third party buying offices for a portion of our product sourcing. Any interruption in the operations of these buying offices, or the failure of these buying offices to perform effectively their services for us, could result in material delays, reductions of shipments and increased costs. Furthermore, such events could harm our wholesale and retail relationships. Any disruption in our relationships with these buying offices or in their businesses could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. If one becomes inoperable, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted.

We operate a limited number of distribution facilities and also engage independently operated distribution facilities around the world to warehouse and ship products to our customers and our retail stores, as well as perform related logistics services. Our ability to meet the needs of our wholesale customers and of our retail stores depends on the proper operation of our primary facilities. If any of our primary facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible, including as a result of disease epidemics and other health-related concerns, such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, we could have a substantial loss of inventory or disruptions of deliveries to our customers and our stores, incur significantly higher costs or experience longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the facility. This could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 

A portion of our revenue is dependent on royalties and licensing.

The operating profit associated with our royalty, advertising and other revenue is significant because the operating expenses directly associated with administering and monitoring an individual licensing or similar agreement are minimal. Therefore, the loss of a significant licensee, whether due to the termination or expiration of the relationship, the cessation of the licensee’s operations or otherwise (including as a result of financial difficulties of the licensee), without an equivalent replacement, or a significant decline in our licensees’ sales, for example as occurred as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, could materially impact our profitability.

While we generally have significant control over our licensees’ products and advertising, we rely on them for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Our licensees’ failure to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace our existing licensees could materially and adversely affect our revenue both directly from reduced royalty, advertising and other revenue received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with our licensees’ ability to obtain capital, execute their business plans, timely deliver quality products, manage their labor relations, maintain relationships with their suppliers, manage their credit risk effectively and maintain relationships with their customers. 

Our licensing business makes us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.

We rely on our licensees to preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our products, we cannot assure you that we can control our licensees’ use of our brands. The misuse of our brands by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights.

Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights, especially with respect to the TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN brands, as they enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally premium pricing of TOMMY HILFIGER and CALVIN KLEIN brand products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. Imitation or counterfeiting of our products or infringement of our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands or otherwise adversely affect our revenue. We cannot assure you that the actions we take to establish and protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We cannot assure you that other third parties will not seek to invalidate our trademarks or block sales of our products as a violation of their own trademarks and intellectual property rights. In addition, we cannot assure you that others will not assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of ours or in marks that are similar to ours or marks that we license or market or that we will be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to our marks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. In other cases, there may be holders who have 

 23

prior rights to similar trademarks. We have in the past been and currently are involved both domestically and internationally in proceedings relating to a company’s claim of prior rights to some of our trademarks or marks similar to some of our brands. 

We face intense competition in the apparel industry.

Competition is intense in the apparel industry. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brand owners, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear, some of which have greater resources than we do. We also face increased competition from online retailers in the digital channel, which is characterized by low barriers to entry. In addition, in certain instances, we compete directly with our wholesale customers, as they also sell their own private label products in their stores and online. We compete within the apparel industry primarily on the basis of:

•anticipating and responding to changing consumer tastes, demands and shopping preferences in a timely manner and developing attractive, quality products;

•maintaining favorable brand recognition and relevance, including through digital brand engagement and online and social media presence;

•appropriately pricing products and creating an acceptable value proposition for customers;

•providing strong and effective marketing support;

•ensuring product availability and optimizing supply chain efficiencies with third party manufacturers and retailers; and

•obtaining sufficient retail floor space at retail and effective presentation of our products at retail, on digital commerce sites operated by our department store customers and pure play digital commerce retailers, and on our digital commerce sites.

The failure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins. 

The apparel industry, particularly in the United States (our largest market), is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers and changes in consumer demand including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, which could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels or offset price reductions with sufficient reductions in product costs or operating expenses. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

If we are unable to manage our inventory effectively and accurately forecast demand for our products, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

We have made and continue to make investments in our supply chain management systems and processes that enable us to respond more rapidly to changes in sales trends and consumer demands and enhance our ability to manage inventory. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to anticipate and respond successfully to changing consumer tastes and style trends or economic conditions and, as a result, we may not be able to manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. If we are unable to or fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which could have a material adverse effect on the reputation of our brands and our profitability. If we underestimate consumer demand for our products, we may not have sufficient inventories of product to meet consumer requirements in a timely manner, which could result in lost revenues, as well as damage to our reputation and relationships. 

We rely significantly on information technology. Our business and reputation could be adversely impacted if our computer systems, or systems of our business partners and service providers, are disrupted or cease to operate effectively or if we or they are subject to a data security or privacy breach.

Our ability to manage and operate our business effectively depends significantly on information technology systems, including systems operated by third parties and us and systems that communicate with third parties, including website and mobile applications through which we communicate with our consumers and our employees. We process, transmit, store and maintain information about consumers, employees, and other individuals in the ordinary course of business, including through our digital 

 24

commerce operations. This includes personally identifiable information protected under applicable laws and the collection and processing of customers’ credit and debit card numbers and reliance on systems maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide payment processing. The failure of any system to operate effectively or disruption in these systems, which may occur as a result of circumstances beyond our control including fire, natural disasters, power outages and systems disruptions, could require significant remediation costs and adversely impact our operations. 

We take, and require third party providers to take, measures to protect data but have no control over their efforts and are limited in our ability to assess their systems and processes. Furthermore, while we invest, and believe our service providers invest, considerable resources in protecting systems and information, we all are still subject to security events, including but not limited to cybercrimes and cybersecurity attacks, such as those perpetrated by sophisticated and well-resourced bad actors attempting to disrupt operations or access or steal data. Security events may not be detected for an extended period of time, which could compound the scope and extent of the damages and problems. Such security events could disrupt our business, severely damage our reputation and our relationship with consumers, and expose us to risks of litigation and liability, which may not be covered by insurance or may result in costs in excess of the insurance coverage we maintain. 

We regularly implement new systems and hardware and are currently undertaking a major multi-year SAP S/4 implementation to upgrade of our platforms and systems worldwide. The implementation of new software and hardware involves risks and uncertainties that could cause disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design, implementation or application of these systems including:

•adversely impacting our operations;

•increased costs;

•disruptions in our ability to effectively source, sell or ship our products;

•delays in collecting payments from our customers; and 

•adversely affecting our ability to timely report our financial results.

Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected as a result of these implementations. In addition, intended improvements may not be realized. Our business partners and service providers face the same risks, which could also adversely impact our business and operations.

 We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations, the number and complexity of which are increasing globally. We may be the subject of enforcement or other legal actions despite our compliance efforts.

We collect, use, store, and otherwise process or rely upon access to data, including personally identifiable information, of consumers, employees, and other individuals in the daily conduct of our business, including through our digital commerce operations. There have been significant developments in the area of data privacy and cybersecurity law and regulation. Significant new laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law and the California Consumer Privacy Act, are continuously being proposed and enacted around the world. These laws and regulations have caused and could continue to cause us to change the way we operate, including in a less efficient manner, in order to comply with local requirements. We have a privacy compliance program but our compliance efforts are not an assurance that we will not be the subject of regulatory or other legal actions. We could expend significant management and associate time and incur significant cost investigating and defending ourselves against the claims in any such matter, which matters also could result in us being the subject of significant fines, judgments or settlements. In addition, any such claim could give rise to significant reputational damage, whether or not we are ultimately successful in defending ourselves.

The loss of members of our executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We depend on the services and management experience of our executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key executives in various areas of our businesses and operations. Competition for qualified personnel in the apparel industry is intense and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our key employees. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us.

A significant shift in the relative sources of our earnings, adverse decisions of tax authorities or changes in tax treaties, laws, rules or interpretations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.

We have direct operations in many countries and the applicable tax rates vary by jurisdiction. As a result, our overall effective tax rate could be materially affected by the relative level of earnings in the various taxing jurisdictions to which our earnings are subject. In addition, the tax laws and regulations in the countries where we operate may be subject to change. Moreover, there may be changes from time to time in interpretation and enforcement of tax law. As a result, we may pay additional taxes if tax rates increase or if tax laws, regulations or treaties in the jurisdictions where we operate are modified by the authorities in an adverse manner.

In addition, various national and local taxing authorities periodically examine us and our subsidiaries. The resolution of an examination or audit may result in us paying more than the amount that we may have reserved for a particular tax matter, which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, business, financial condition and results of operations for any affected reporting period.

We and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm’s length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, which should be respected for tax purposes, the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities, which could result in additional tax liabilities.

If we are unable to fully utilize our deferred tax assets, our profitability could be reduced.

Our deferred income tax assets are valuable to us. These assets include tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in various jurisdictions. Realization of deferred tax assets is based on a number of factors, including whether there will be adequate levels of taxable income in future periods to offset the tax loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards in jurisdictions where such assets have arisen. Valuation allowances are recorded in order to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized in the future. In assessing the adequacy of our valuation allowances, we consider various factors including reversal of deferred tax liabilities, forecasted future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies. These factors could reduce the value of the deferred tax assets, which could have a material effect on our profitability.

Volatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could increase substantially our defined benefit pension costs and liabilities. 

We have significant obligations under our defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on invested plan assets and the discount rate used to measure pension obligations. Unfavorable returns on plan assets, which, for example, may result from recent market volatility due, in part, to the COVID-19 outbreak, a lower discount rate or unfavorable changes in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for our business. 

Our operating performance also may be significantly impacted by the amount of expense recorded for our pension plans. Pension expense recorded throughout the year is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are recorded immediately in pension expense, generally in the fourth quarter of the year. These gains and losses can be significant and can create volatility in our operating results. 

Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the estimated fair value of an intangible asset or of a reporting unit could result in an impairment charge recorded in our operating results, which could be material.

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Also, we review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of our goodwill or another intangible asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value, with the impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.

As of February 2, 2020, we had approximately $3.678 billion of goodwill and $3.481 billion of other identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet, which together represented 53% of our total assets. No impairment was recorded in 2019 based on our annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment tests. However, during the fourth quarter of 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Speedo North America business, which prompted the need for us to perform an interim impairment assessment of our Speedo perpetual license right. As a result of this interim test, the perpetual license right was determined to be impaired and an impairment charge of $116.4 million was recorded. The Speedo transaction was also a triggering event that prompted the need for us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test for the Heritage Brands Wholesale reporting unit, the reporting unit that includes the Speedo North America business. No goodwill impairment resulted from this interim test.

Our balance sheet includes a significant amount of long-lived assets in our retail stores, including operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment. A decline in the current and projected cash flows in our retail stores could result in impairment charges, which could be material.

Long-lived assets, such as operating lease right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment in our retail stores, are tested for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset were to exceed its fair value, the asset would be written down to its fair value and an impairment charge recognized as a noncash expense in our operating results. Adverse changes in future market conditions or weaker operating results compared to our expectations, including, for example, as a result of the current COVID-19 outbreak, may impact our projected cash flows and estimates of weighted average cost of capital, which could result in a potentially material impairment charge if we are unable to recover the carrying value of our long-lived assets. 

Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and our by-laws and Delaware General Corporation Law could make it more difficult to acquire us and may reduce the market price of our common stock.

Our certificate of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions requiring stockholders who seek to introduce proposals at a stockholders meeting or nominate a person to become a director to provide us with advance notice and certain information, as well as meet certain ownership criteria; permitting the Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the Board; and authorizing the Board to issue shares of preferred stock without approval of our stockholders. These provisions could have the effect of deterring changes of control.

In addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our common stock. The existence of this provision may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the Board.

The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union could harm our business and financial results.

Voters in the United Kingdom approved a referendum to withdraw from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”). The United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union on January 31, 2020 and is now in a period of transition until December 31, 2020. During the transition period, the United Kingdom’s trading relationship with the European Union is expected to remain largely the same while the two parties negotiate a trade agreement as well as other aspects of the United Kingdom’s relationship with the European Union. The uncertainty surrounding the terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union after December 31, 2020 and its consequences could adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the level of consumer purchases of discretionary items and retail products, including our products. The eventual terms upon which the withdrawal occurs (which could leave the United Kingdom without a trade agreement with the European Union) also could significantly disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and may result in increased legal and regulatory complexities and higher costs of conducting business in Europe. Volatility in the value of the British pound sterling, the euro and other European currencies could also result. Any of these effects, among others, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
