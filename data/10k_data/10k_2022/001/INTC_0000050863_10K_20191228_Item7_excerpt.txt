MARKET AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Market trends and strategy

Data is a significant force in society, and is being generated at an unprecedented pace. Data center customers want to work with partners who can deliver platforms to address their most important technology challenges. Additionally, as more data is generated, organizations are seeking to analyze data closer to point of origin, giving rise to a data-centric edge environment across industries and providers. We expect the massive growth of data worldwide will increase demand to move, store, and process data and extract value from data. We are one of the few companies that touches every part of the data-centric compute landscape, and we have invested both organically and through acquisitions to capitalize on these demands. We expect these trends to continue to fuel demand in DCG and other data-centric businesses in the long term. 

DCG focuses on three market segments: cloud service providers, enterprise and government, and communications service providers. In 2019, cloud revenue grew as service providers continued to invest in infrastructure to meet the explosive demand for digital services, AI, and data analytics. Cloud service provider revenue was down in the first half as customers absorbed capacity and worked through inventory after a historic 2018 platform refresh; this trend stabilized in the second half of 2019. In our enterprise and government market segment, legacy architecture continues to decline on-premise, but enterprises are rapidly embracing cloud as an architecture, and we expect to continue to see growth in hybrid and multi-cloud deployments. In the communications service provider market segment, we gained market segment share as customers chose to virtualize and transform their networks and prepare for the 5G transition using Intel® architecture.

Products and competitiveness

We offer customers an unmatched, broad portfolio of platforms and technologies designed to provide workload-optimized performance across compute, storage, and network. These offerings span the full spectrum from the data center core to the network edge.

Our product portfolio employs a broad set of technologies, covering computer vision and machine learning-based sensing, data analysis, localization, mapping, and driving policy technology for ADAS and autonomous driving. Mobileye’s ADAS products form the building blocks for higher levels of autonomy. Our customers and strategic partners include major global OEMs and Tier 1 automotive system integrators. 

HIGHLIGHTS AND SEGMENT IMPERATIVES

●We achieved record revenue and operating income in 2019 primarily due to the increased adoption of ADAS. Our EyeQ* SoC volume grew approximately 43% and we expect to see additional growth in the adoption of enhanced ADAS technologies.

“Mobileye is fueling Intel’s entry into the Mobility-as-a-Service business and is fully committed to building on its leadership and know-how in the ADAS market in order to bring truly safe and scalable autonomous mobility to the market.”

—Prof. Amnon Shashua, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mobileye

●We had more than 30 new design wins, 47 active production programs1 across 25 OEMs, and 16 program launches, including an industry-first 100-degree front-facing camera.

●Production vehicles equipped with our EyeQ*4 SoC and REMTM technology are deployed across the globe and by the end of 2019 were collecting up to approximately 6 million kilometers of data each day. This data is automatically aggregated with high update frequency into "Roadbook™, a high-definition map, which is an essential component for Robotaxi (autonomous taxis), consumer AV, and the fast-growing L2+ segment. The insights gained from this data enhance existing driver-assistance propositions and provide customers with superior driving experiences, performance, and additional safety.

MARKET AND BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Market trends and strategy

The adoption of ADAS is expanding as consumers increasingly consider ADAS a differentiating factor in their automotive purchasing decisions. The continued growth of ADAS is dependent on various factors, including regulation, market demand, and consumers' recognition of its value. Mobileye's ADAS solutions also serve as a qualification space for our autonomous technology, using vast experience and proliferation to validate and constantly improve AV technology. AV technologies, in turn, make their way into premium ADAS solutions, broadening monetization opportunities and value proposition. The AV-ADAS interplay allows Mobileye to sustain its technology leadership.

Car manufacturers are looking to enhance current L2+ solutions by improving system fidelity, availability, and performance. High-definition maps with constant updates, global coverage, and various semantic features are a prerequisite for L2+ applications and the future deployment of Robotaxi and passenger car autonomy (Consumer AV). Canonical mapping methods rely on extensive manual labor and dedicated mapping vehicles. Mobileye's disruptive REM crowdsource mapping technology provides automatic map creation and updates. REM mapping capabilities are also being leveraged to extend the value of static and dynamic data to businesses in new market segments such as smart cities and infrastructure surveys.

We believe the future of autonomous driving will unfold in two phases: commercial Robotaxi and series-production passenger car Consumer AV. We expect Consumer AV to materialize only after the Robotaxi industry deploys and matures. The main inhibitors of a mass market product offering of Consumer AV are the cost of AV technology, ability to scale at a low cost, regulation structure, and public acceptance. Thus, we see the Robotaxi phase as a necessary corridor to Consumer AV. Mobileye is well positioned to play a significant role in the broader MaaS market with the commercialization of Robotaxi and the future Consumer AV market. Our full-stack self-driving system—geared with our camera-centric backbone and vast experience in productizing cutting-edge technology in the automotive industry—is the foundation for developing an economically competitive AV solution. Proliferation of data-collection vehicles alongside REM technology will allow for low-cost geographic expansion and coverage. Thus, Mobileye is entering the MaaS market segment as an end-to-end service provider at scale.

 MD&A 23
Products and competitiveness

At its core, Mobileye's offering for ADAS and AV is propelled by our computer vision and AI expertise and software assets, deployed on our EyeQ* SoC family. The tight co-design of hardware and software gives the EyeQ* SoC the ability to support complex and computationally intense tasks and sets it apart from competition because it is purpose-fit for high-compute, low-power, automotive-compliant mission profiles. Mobileye’s 5th generation EyeQ*5 SoC is designed to act as the central computer for fully autonomous driving vehicles. Mobileye has been able to achieve power, performance, and cost targets by employing proprietary computational cores that are optimized for a wide variety of computer vision, signal processing, and machine learning tasks, including deep neural networks. Starting with EyeQ*5, Mobileye is supporting an automotive-grade standard operating system and providing a complete software development kit to allow customers to differentiate their solutions by deploying their algorithms on EyeQ*5. The EyeQ*5 SoC will be in final sampling stages in 2020 and is expected to be in commercial vehicles starting in 2021. The EyeQ*5 SoC is already operational in Mobileye’s autonomous test vehicles.

EyeQ*5 serves as the computational foundation for Mobileye’s scalable camera-only surround sensing system. The system consists of multiple independent computer vision engines and deep networks for algorithmic redundancy. The result is a robust and comprehensive model of the environment that allows end-to-end autonomous driving. The surround computer vision system is the backbone of Mobileye’s autonomous vehicle architecture and the flagship offering for next-generation ADAS.

The next significant building block in Mobileye’s complete offering is REM mapping technology, which compiles crowdsourced mapping data from EyeQ* SoC-equipped vehicles. Our REM Roadbook™ offering can enhance current ADAS applications through a variety of advanced features, including predictive adaptive cruise control, lane-level localization in all weather and road conditions, hands-free driving application, and real-time alerts, such as for construction activity and road hazards. 

The third building block in Mobileye’s full stack offering is our unique formal model for AV safety (RSS). At its core, RSS is a pragmatic method to design and then to efficiently validate the safety of an AV, serving as the governing safety layer for the decision-making system. RSS formalizes human decision making for safe driving under two main principles: First, it acknowledges the need to balance safety with useful driving by making plausible worst-case scenario assumptions for other road users; and second, it provides a technology-neutral model and a transparent framework for the regulatory endeavor of building an industry standard for safety.

We derived most of our overall gross margin dollars from the sale of platform products in the DCG and CCG operating segments. Our overall gross margin dollars in 2019 decreased by $1.6 billion, or 4%, compared to 2018, and in 2018 increased by $4.6 billion, or 12%, compared to 2017. In 2019, our adjacent products revenue continued to grow primarily due to memory and modem products, which have a lower gross margin percentage than our overall average. Lower platform unit sales and margin compression on memory products resulted in lower gross margins, which were partially offset by platform ASP strength.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Total R&D and MG&A expenses for 2019 were $19.5 billion, down 4% from 2018. These expenses represented 27.1% of revenue for 2019 and 28.6% of revenue for 2018. 

We continue to invest in R&D to accelerate our growth and profitability while driving operational efficiencies to reduce our MG&A spending. Over the next three years, we plan to continue to reduce our spending as a percentage of revenue down to 25%.

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

GAINS (LOSSES) ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS, NET

Ongoing mark-to-market net gains and losses reported in 2019 and 2018 were primarily driven by ASML Holding N.V. (ASML) and Cloudera Inc. (Cloudera). During 2019 we sold our equity investment in ASML.

In 2019, we recognized $293 million in observable price adjustments primarily from one investment.

During 2018, we recognized an impairment charge of $290 million in our equity method investment in IMFT. During 2017, we recognized impairment charges in our investments of Cloudera for $278 million and Unisoc for $308 million. 

Major drivers of sales of equity investments and other in 2019 were dividends of $632 million from McAfee and a gain of $107 million from our sale of our non-controlling interest in IMFT. In 2017, we recognized $3.4 billion in realized gains on sales of a portion of our interest in ASML.

INTEREST AND OTHER, NET

We recognized a higher net gain in interest and other in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower loss on debt conversions and larger divestiture gains in 2019 compared to 2018.

We recognized a net gain in interest and other in 2018 compared to a net loss in 2017, primarily due to lower losses on debt conversions, higher assets under construction resulting in more capitalized interest, and larger divestiture gains in 2018 compared to 2017.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash generated by operations is our primary source of liquidity. When assessing our sources of liquidity, we include investments as shown in the preceding table. We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments and financing receivables are in investment-grade securities.

Other potential sources of liquidity include our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of December 28, 2019, no commercial paper remained outstanding. During 2019, we issued a total of $2.8 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received proceeds of $648 million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona and the State of Oregon Business Development Commission. We also redeemed our $915 million, 4.70% senior notes due December 2045. Additionally, we repaid $170 million of our 3.25% senior notes that matured in December 2019 and paid $1.5 billion in cash to satisfy conversion requests for a portion of our $2.0 billion 2009 Debentures. In November 2019, we issued a notice of redemption for the remaining $372 million of 2009 Debentures with a redemption date of January 9, 2020.

We believe we have sufficient financial resources to meet our business requirements in the next 12 months, including capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, dividends, and common stock repurchases.

"Our finance team plays a fundamental role in partnering with the business to ensure we have the capital and financial resources available to fund our global operations and future growth initiatives."

SOURCES AND USES OF CASH

(In Millions)

In summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 MD&A 41
OPERATING ACTIVITIES

Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities.

For 2019 compared to 2018, the $3.7 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes, other assets and liabilities, and accounts receivable, offset by customer utilization of prepaid supply agreement payments and inventory build.

For 2018 compared to 2017, the $7.3 billion increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net income, offset by changes in working capital. Changes in working capital were driven by taxes and accounts receivables, offset by relatively flat inventory levels. Income taxes paid, net of refunds, in 2018 compared to 2017 were flat as the benefit of a lower U.S. corporate tax rate was offset by the payment related to the 2017 U.S. Tax Reform transition tax. We received $1.4 billion of customer deposits and prepaid supply agreements in 2018, net of customer utilization, compared to $1.1 billion in 2017. 

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from divestitures and cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures were $16.2 billion in 2019 ($15.2 billion in 2018 and $11.8 billion in 2017). 

The increase in cash used for investing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to net trading asset activity, acquisitions, and capital expenditures. The increase was partially offset by net available-for-sale debt investment activity.

The decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower cash paid on acquisitions and increased cash from net trading asset activity. This was partially offset by increased capital expenditures, net available-for-sale debt investments activity, decreased proceeds from divestitures, and decreased sales of equity investments (substantially all from ASML sales).

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

Financing cash flows consist primarily of repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock through employee equity incentive plans.

The decrease in cash used for financing activities in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to increased long-term debt issuance, offset by increased repurchases of common stock. During 2019, we repurchased $13.6 billion of common stock under our authorized common stock repurchase program, compared to $10.7 billion in 2018. In October 2019, the Board of Directors approved a $20.0 billion increase in our authorized stock repurchase program authorization, and we announced that we expect to repurchase $20.0 billion in stock over the next 15 to 18 months. As of December 28, 2019, $23.8 billion remained available for repurchasing common stock under the repurchase authorization limit. In general, we base our level of common stock repurchases on internal cash management decisions, and this level may fluctuate in the future. Our total dividend payments were $5.6 billion in 2019 compared to $5.5 billion in 2018. We have paid a cash dividend in each of the past 109 quarters. In Q1 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per share of common stock, payable on March 1, 2020 to stockholders of record on February 7, 2020. 

The increase in cash used for financing activities in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to decreased long-term debt issuance and increased repurchases of common stock. 

 MD&A 42
CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

Significant contractual obligations as of December 28, 2019 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Operating lease obligations represent the undiscounted lease payments under non-cancelable leases, but exclude non-lease components. 

2 Capital purchase obligations represent commitments for the construction or purchase of property, plant and equipment. They were not recorded as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 28, 2019, as we had not yet received the related goods nor taken title to the property.

3 Other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under various types of licenses and agreements to purchase goods or services. 

4 Tax obligations represent the future cash payments related to Tax Reform enacted in 2017 for the one-time transition tax on our previously untaxed foreign earnings. For further information, see "Note 9: Income Taxes" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.

5 Amounts represent principal payments for all debt obligations and interest payments for fixed-rate debt obligations. Interest payments on floating-rate debt obligations, as well as the impact of fixed-rate to floating-rate debt swaps, are excluded. Debt obligations are classified based on their stated maturity date, regardless of their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 

6 Amounts represent future cash payments to satisfy other long-term liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the short-term portion of these long-term liabilities. Derivative instruments are excluded from the preceding table, because they do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid.

7 Total excludes contractual obligations already recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as current liabilities, except for the short-term portions of long-term debt obligations and other long-term liabilities.

The expected timing of payments of the obligations in the preceding table is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different, depending on the time of receipt of goods or services, or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.

Contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services included in "Other purchase obligations and commitments" in the preceding table include agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum, or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. For obligations with cancellation provisions, the amounts included in the preceding table were limited to the non-cancelable portion of the agreement terms or the minimum cancellation fee.

For the purchase of raw materials, we have entered into certain agreements that specify minimum prices and quantities based on a percentage of the total available market or based on a percentage of our future purchasing requirements. Due to the uncertainty of the future market and our future purchasing requirements, as well as the non-binding nature of these agreements, obligations under these agreements have been excluded from the preceding table. Our purchase orders for other products are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons. In addition, some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements.

Contractual obligations that are contingent upon the achievement of certain milestones have been excluded from the preceding table. Approximately half of our milestone-based contracts are tooling related for the purchase of capital equipment. These arrangements are not considered contractual obligations until the milestone is met by the counterparty. As of December 28, 2019, assuming that all future milestones are met, the additional required payments would be approximately $498 million.

For the majority of RSUs granted, the number of shares of common stock issued on the date the RSUs vest is net of the minimum statutory withholding requirements that we pay in cash to the appropriate taxing authorities on behalf of our employees. The obligation to pay the relevant taxing authority is excluded from the preceding table, as the amount is contingent upon continued employment. In addition, the amount of the obligation is unknown, as it is based in part on the market price of our common stock when the awards vest.
