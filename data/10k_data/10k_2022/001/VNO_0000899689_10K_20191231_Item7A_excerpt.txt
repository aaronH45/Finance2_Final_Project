ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We have exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates. Market interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control. Our exposure to a change in interest rates on our consolidated and non-consolidated debt (all of which arises out of non-trading activity) is as follows:

_______________________

(1)As a result of the bankruptcy plan of reorganization for Toys "R" Us, Inc. ("Toys") being declared effective and our stock in Toys being canceled, we no longer hold an investment in Toys. Accordingly, no Toys debt is included in our pro rata share of debt of non-consolidated entities.

(2)Our pro rata share of debt of non-consolidated entities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 is net of our $63,409 share of Alexander's participation in its Rego Park II shopping center mortgage loan which is considered partially extinguished as the participation interest is a reacquisition of debt.

Derivatives and Hedging 

We utilize various financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our cash flows and earnings, including hedging strategies, depending on our analysis of the interest rate environment and the costs and risks of such strategies. The following table summarizes our consolidated derivative instruments, all of which hedge variable rate debt, as of December 31, 2019.

Fair Value of Debt

The estimated fair value of our consolidated debt is calculated based on current market prices and discounted cash flows at the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining term of such debt. As of December 31, 2019, the estimated fair value of our consolidated debt was $7,507,000,000.
