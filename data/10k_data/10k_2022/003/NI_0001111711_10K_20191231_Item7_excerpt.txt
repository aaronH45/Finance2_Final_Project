EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Management’s Discussion) analyzes our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and those of our subsidiaries. It also includes management’s analysis of past financial results and certain potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks. See "Note regarding forward-looking statements" at the beginning of this report for a list of factors that may cause results to differ materially.

Management’s Discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.

We are an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in seven states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations. 

Refer to the “Business” section under Item 1 of this annual report and Note 23, "Segments of Business," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments.

Our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we address changing customer conservation patterns, develops more contemporary pricing structures and embarks on long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs. These strategies are intended to improve reliability and safety, enhance customer services and reduce emissions while generating sustainable returns. Additionally, we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on our system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner. Refer also to the discussion of Electric Supply within our Electric Operations Segment discussion for additional information on our long term electric generation strategy. 

Greater Lawrence Incident: The Greater Lawrence Incident occurred on September 13, 2018. The following table summarizes expenses incurred and insurance recoveries recorded since the Greater Lawrence Incident. The amounts set forth in the table below do not include the capital cost of the pipeline replacement described below and as set forth in Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Pipeline Replacement," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

with government investigations as set forth in Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings," will range from $1,041 million to $1,065 million, depending on the number, nature, final outcome and value of third-party claims and the final outcome of government investigations. These costs do not include costs of certain third-party claims and fines, penalties or settlements with government investigations that we are not able to estimate. We expect to incur a total of $450 million to $460 million in other incident-related costs, inclusive of the $420 million recorded incident to date, as set forth in Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Incident Restoration." 

The process for estimating costs associated with third-party claims and fines, penalties and settlements associated with government investigations relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident requires management to exercise significant judgment based on a number of assumptions and subjective factors. As more information becomes known, including additional information regarding ongoing investigations, management’s estimates and assumptions regarding the financial impact of the Greater Lawrence Incident may change.

The aggregate amount of third-party liability insurance coverage available for losses arising from the Greater Lawrence Incident is $800 million. We have collected the entire $800 million as of December 31, 2019. Expenses related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. The following table presents activity related to our Greater Lawrence Incident insurance recovery. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)$5 million of insurance recoveries were collected during 2018.

Since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through December 31, 2019, we have invested approximately $258 million of capital spend for the pipeline replacement; this work was completed in 2019. We maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property. Columbia of Massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the full cost of the pipeline replacement. In January 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer, seeking payment of our property claim. We are currently unable to predict the timing or amount of any insurance recovery under the property policy. The recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding; a future regulatory proceeding is dependent on the outcome of the sale of the Massachusetts Business. The outcome of such a proceeding (if any) is uncertain. In accordance with ASC 980-360, if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated, we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings. This could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment, a loss on disallowance may be required.

Refer to Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings" and " - E. Other Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Summary of Consolidated Financial Results," "Results and Discussion of Segment Operation - Gas Distribution Operations," and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this Management's Discussion for additional information related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.

Additionally, as discussed in Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we assessed the totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, a new impairment analysis was required for our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. The year-end impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we reduced the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to zero and recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling $204.8 million, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. We assessed the same fourth quarter circumstances in reviewing the Columbia of Massachusetts franchise rights intangible assets. These factors led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise rights was below its carrying amount. As a result, we performed a year-end impairment test and determined that the fair value of the franchise rights was zero. Therefore, we wrote off the entire franchise rights book value, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $209.7 million.

Columbia of Massachusetts Asset Sale: On February 26, 2020, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement with Eversource. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Asset Purchase Agreement, NiSource and Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to sell to Eversource the Massachusetts Business for a purchase price of $1,100 million, subject to adjustment. For additional information, see Note 26, “Subsequent Event,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Summary of Consolidated Financial Results

Our operations are affected by the cost of sales. Cost of sales for the Gas Distribution Operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. Cost of sales for the Electric Operations segment is comprised of the cost of coal, related handling costs, natural gas purchased for the internal generation of electricity at NIPSCO and the cost of power purchased from third-party generators of electricity. 

The majority of the cost of sales are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues. As a result, we believe net revenues, a non-GAAP financial measure defined as operating revenues less cost of sales (excluding depreciation and amortization), provides management and investors a useful measure to analyze profitability. The presentation of net revenues herein is intended to provide supplemental information for investors regarding operating performance. Net revenues do not intend to represent operating income, the most comparable GAAP measure, as an indicator of operating performance and is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

NISOURCE INC.

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, operating income and a reconciliation of net revenues to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, operating income, was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On a consolidated basis, we reported net income available to common shareholders of $328.0 million or $0.88 per basic share for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 compared to a loss to common shareholders of $65.6 million or $0.18 per basic share for the same period in 2018. The increase in net income available to common shareholders during 2019 was primarily due to lower operating expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, insurance recoveries recorded related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and new rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs. These increases were partially offset by non-cash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 related to Columbia of Massachusetts (see Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), higher income taxes (see "Income Taxes" below), higher depreciation expense due to regulatory outcomes at NIPSCO and Columbia of Ohio, and additional dilution in 2019 resulting from preferred stock dividend commitments.

Operating Income

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we reported operating income of $890.7 million compared to $124.7 million for the same period in 2018. The increased operating income was primarily due to decreased operating expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, insurance recoveries recorded related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and new rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs. These increases were partially offset by non-cash impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets in 2019 related to Columbia of Massachusetts (see Note 6, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Asset," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information), and increased depreciation due to the regulatory outcome of NIPSCO's gas rate case and an increase in amortization of depreciation previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from Columbia of Ohio's CEP.

Other Deductions, Net

Other deductions, net reduced income by $384.1 million in 2019 compared to a reduction in income of $355.3 million in 2018. This change is primarily due to lower actuarial investment returns on pension and other postretirement benefit assets of $34.6 million, and an increase in interest expense of $25.6 million driven by decreased regulatory deferrals from Columbia of Ohio's CEP. These unfavorable variances were partially offset by charitable contributions of $20.7 million in 2018 related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.

Income Taxes

The increase in income tax expense from 2018 to 2019 is primarily attributable to higher pre-tax income resulting from the items discussed above in "Operating Income" and "Other Deductions, Net," true-ups to tax expense in 2018 to reflect regulatory outcomes associated with excess deferred income taxes, and higher income tax expense in 2019 related to the non-deductible, non-cash impairment of goodwill, fines and penalties.

Refer to “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below and Note 10, "Income Taxes," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rate.

Capital Investment 

In 2019, we invested approximately $1.9 billion in capital expenditures across the gas and electric utilities. These expenditures were primarily aimed at furthering the safety and reliability of our gas distribution system, and maintaining our existing electric generation fleet. 

We continue to execute on an estimated $30 billion in total projected long-term regulated utility infrastructure investments and expect to invest approximately $1.8 to $1.9 billion in capital during 2020 as we continue to focus on growth, safety and modernization projects across our operating area.

Liquidity

A primary focus of ours is to ensure the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing safety and infrastructure investment programs which typically involves the issuance of debt and/or equity. In addition, expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. During 2020, we plan to pursue alternatives to cover this shortfall, including long-term financing and potential proceeds from the sale of the Massachusetts Business. For additional information, see Note 26, "Subsequent Event," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under our short-term revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, accounts receivable securitization facilities, term loan borrowings, long-term debt agreements, our ability to access the capital markets and the potential sale of the Massachusetts Business, we believe there is adequate capital available to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures and the effects of the Greater Lawrence Incident in 2020 and beyond. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had approximately $1,409.1 million and $974.6 million, respectively, of net liquidity available, consisting of cash and available capacity under credit facilities.

These factors and other impacts to the financial results are discussed in more detail within the following discussions of “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations” and “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Regulatory Developments

In 2019, we continued to move forward on core infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all seven states of our operating area. Refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters” and Note 19-E, "Other Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of key regulatory developments that transpired during 2019.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Comparability of line item operating results may be impacted by regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers (other than those for cost of sales) that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are generally offset by increases in net revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.

2019 vs. 2018 Operating Income

For 2019, Gas Distribution Operations reported operating income of $675.4 million, an increase in income of $929.5 million from the comparable 2018 period.

Net revenues for 2019 were $2,455.2 million, an increase of $295.0 million from the same period in 2018. The change in net revenues was primarily driven by:

•New rates from base rate proceedings and infrastructure replacement programs of $243.2 million.

•Higher regulatory, depreciation, and tax trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $36.2 million.

•Higher revenues of $14.5 million resulting from an update in the weather-related normal heating degree day methodology (see further detail below), partially offset by a $7.1 million revenue decrease from the effects of warmer weather in 2019.

•The effects of commercial and residential customer growth of $12.8 million.

Operating expenses were $634.5 million lower in 2019 compared to 2018. This change was primarily driven by:

•Decreased expenses related to third-party claims and other costs for the Greater Lawrence Incident of $1,090.7 million, net of insurance recoveries recorded.

Partially offset by:

•Non-cash impairment of the Columbia of Massachusetts franchise rights of $209.7 million.

•Increased depreciation of $103.8 million due to the regulatory outcome of NIPSCO's gas rate case, an increase in amortization of depreciation previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from Columbia of Ohio's CEP, and higher capital expenditures placed in service.

•Higher employee and administrative expenses of $50.2 million driven by resources shifting from the temporary assistance on the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration to normal operations (offset in the decreased Greater Lawrence Incident costs discussed above) and an increase in headcount.

•Increased regulatory, depreciation, and tax trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $36.2 million.

•Higher property taxes of $22.2 million primarily due to increased amortization of property taxes previously deferred as a regulatory asset resulting from Columbia of Ohio's CEP, as well as higher capital expenditures placed in service.

•Higher outside services of $17.4 million primarily due to increased line location and safety-related work.

•Higher insurance expense of $9.1 million primarily driven by increased premiums.

2018 vs. 2017 Operating Income

For 2018, Gas Distribution Operations reported an operating loss of $254.1 million, a decrease in income of $804.2 million from the comparable 2017 period. 

Net revenues for 2018 were $2,160.2 million, an increase of $63.1 million from the same period in 2017. The change in net revenues was primarily driven by:

•New rates from infrastructure replacement programs and base rate proceedings of $99.6 million.

•Higher revenues from the effects of colder weather in 2018 of $37.5 million.

•The effects of customer growth and increased usage of $17.4 million.

•Higher regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $16.0 million.

Partially offset by:

•A revenue reserve of $85.0 million in 2018 resulting from the probable future refund of certain collections from customers as a result of the lower income tax rate from the TCJA.

•Decreased rates from implementation of regulatory outcomes related to the TCJA of $24.7 million.

Gas Distribution Operations (continued)

Operating expenses were $867.3 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017. This change was primarily driven by:

•Expenses related to third-party claims and other costs for the Greater Lawrence Incident of $864.4 million, net of insurance recoveries recorded.

•Increased depreciation of $29.6 million due to regulatory outcomes of NIPSCO's gas rate case and higher capital expenditures placed in service.

•Higher regulatory, tax and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $16.0 million.

•Increased property taxes of $11.0 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service and the impact of regulatory-driven property tax deferrals.

Partially offset by:

•Decreased outside services of $33.2 million primarily due to IT service provider transition and other strategic initiative costs in 2017, lower ongoing IT costs and a temporary shift of resources to the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration.

•Lower employee and administrative expenses of $30.2 million driven by reduced incentive compensation and a temporary shift of resources to the Greater Lawrence Incident restoration.

Weather

In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days. Our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution Operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison.

The definition of “normal” weather was updated during the first quarter of 2019 to reflect more current weather pattern data and to more closely align with the regulators' jurisdictional definitions of “normal” weather. Impacts of the change in methodology will be reflected prospectively and disclosed to the extent it results in notable year-over-year variances in net revenues.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2019 was about 1% warmer than normal and about 3% warmer than 2018; however, due to the aforementioned change in methodology, the change in net revenues attributed to weather resulted in an increase of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The variance is detailed further below:

•An update in the weather-related normal heating degree day methodology resulting in a favorable variance attributed to weather of $14.5 million, as discussed above.

Offset by:

•The effects of warmer weather in 2019 of $7.1 million.

Weather in the Gas Distribution Operations service territories for 2018 was about 1% warmer than normal and about 13% colder than 2017, increasing net revenues $37.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.

Throughput

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2019 were 1,040.2 MMDth, compared to 1,053.6 MMDth for 2018. This decrease is primarily attributable to warmer weather experienced in 2019 compared to 2018.

Total volumes sold and transported for the year ended December 31, 2018 were 1,053.6 MMDth, compared to 973.2 MMDth for 2017. This increase is primarily attributable to colder weather experienced in 2018 compared to 2017.

Economic Conditions

All of our Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs. Gas costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings.

2019 vs. 2018 Operating Income

For 2019, Electric Operations reported operating income of $406.8 million, an increase of $20.7 million from the comparable 2018 period.

Net revenues for 2019 were $1,231.9 million, an increase of $25.8 million from the same period in 2018. The change in net revenues was primarily driven by:

•New rates from the recent rate case proceeding, incremental capital spend on infrastructure replacement programs, and electric transmission projects of $24.8 million.

•Decreased fuel handling costs of $11.0 million.

•Higher regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $8.4 million.

•Increased commercial and residential customer growth of $3.9 million.

Partially offset by:

•Lower revenues from the effects of cooler weather of $15.1 million.

•Decreased residential, commercial and industrial usage of $10.8 million.

Operating expenses were $5.1 million higher in 2019 than 2018. This change was primarily driven by:

•Higher regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in net revenues, of $8.4 million.

•Increased depreciation of $8.7 million due to higher capital expenditures placed in service.

Partially offset by:

•Decreased materials and supplies costs of $7.8 million, primarily related to the retirement of Bailly Generating Station Units 7 and 8 on May 31, 2018.

•Decreased employee and administrative costs of $5.0 million.

2018 vs. 2017 Operating Income

For 2018, Electric Operations reported operating income of $386.1 million, an increase of $18.7 million from the comparable 2017 period.

Net revenues for 2018 were $1,206.1 million, a decrease of $66.5 million from the same period in 2017. The change in net revenues was primarily driven by:

•Lower regulatory and depreciation trackers, which are offset in operating expense, of $35.6 million.

•Decreased rates from implementation of regulatory outcomes related to the TCJA of $32.9 million.

•Decreased industrial usage of $17.1 million.

•A revenue reserve of $16.2 million in 2018 resulting from the probable future refund of certain collections from customers as a result of the lower income tax rate from the TCJA .

•Increased fuel handling costs of $7.3 million.

Weather

In general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days. Our composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of Electric Operations. Heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating or cooling degree day comparison.

The definition of “normal” weather was updated during the first quarter of 2019 to reflect more current weather pattern data and to more closely align with the regulators' jurisdictional definitions of “normal” weather. Impacts of the change in methodology will be reflected prospectively and disclosed to the extent it results in notable year-over-year variances in net revenues.

Weather in the Electric Operations’ territories for 2019 was 20% warmer than normal and 18% cooler than the same period in 2018, decreasing net revenues $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018.

Weather in the Electric Operations’ territories for 2018 was 46% warmer than normal and 41% warmer than the same period in 2017, increasing net revenues $25.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017.

Sales

Electric Operations sales were 15,721.3 GWh for 2019, a decrease of 726.7 GWh, or 4.4% compared to 2018. This decrease was primarily attributable to higher internal generation from large industrial customers in 2019 and the effects of cooler weather on residential and commercial customers.

Electric Operations sales were 16,448.0 GWh for 2018, a decrease of 277.6 GWh, or 1.7% compared to 2017. This decrease was primarily attributable to higher internal generation from large industrial customers in 2018, partially offset by increased volumes for residential and commercial customers resulting from warmer weather.

BP Products North America. On March 29, 2018, WCE, which is currently owned by BP p.l.c ("BP") and BP Products North America, which operates the BP Refinery, filed a petition at the IURC asking that the combined operations of WCE and BP be treated as a single premise, and the WCE generation be dedicated primarily to BP Refinery operations beginning in May 2019 as WCE has self-certified as a qualifying facility at FERC. BP Refinery planned to continue to purchase electric service from NIPSCO at a reduced demand level beginning May 2019; however, a settlement agreement was filed on November 2, 2018 agreeing that BP and WCE would not move forward with construction of a private transmission line to serve BP until conclusion of NIPSCO's pending electric rate case. The IURC approved the settlement agreement as filed on February 20, 2019. On December 4, 2019, the IURC issued an order in the electric rate case approving the implementation of a new industrial service structure. This resolved the issues included in BP’s original petition. Refer to Note 8, "Regulatory Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Economic Conditions

NIPSCO has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs. Fuel costs are treated as pass-through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period. The fuel costs included in revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings.

NIPSCO's performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry. NIPSCO’s MWh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 51.5% and 49.7% of the total industrial MWh sales for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Electric Supply

NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan. Multiple factors, but primarily economic ones, including low natural gas prices, advancing cost effective renewable technology and increasing capital and operating costs associated with existing coal plants, have led NIPSCO to conclude in its October 2018 Integrated Resource Plan submission that NIPSCO’s current fleet of coal generation facilities will be retired earlier than previous Integrated Resource Plan’s had indicated.

Electric Operations (continued)

The Integrated Resource Plan evaluated demand-side and supply-side resource alternatives to reliably and cost effectively meet NIPSCO customers' future energy requirements over the ensuing 20 years. The preferred option within the Integrated Resource Plan retires R.M. Schahfer Generating Station (Units 14, 15, 17, and 18) by 2023 and Michigan City Generating Station (Unit 12) by 2028. These units represent 2,080 MW of generating capacity, equal to 72% of NIPSCO’s remaining capacity after the retirement of Bailly Units 7 and 8 in May of 2018. 

The current replacement plan includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of NIPSCO ownership and PPAs. Refer to Note 19-E, "Other Matters," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Greater Lawrence Incident: As discussed in the "Executive Summary" and in Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingencies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have recorded and paid costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident and have invested capital to replace the entire affected 45-mile cast iron and bare steel pipeline system that delivers gas to the impacted area. As discussed in the "Executive Summary," Note 19 referenced earlier in this paragraph, and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors,” we may incur additional expenses and liabilities in excess of our recorded liabilities and estimated additional costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident. Since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through December 31, 2019, we have collected $800 million from insurance providers; however, total costs related to the incident have exceeded the total amount of insurance coverage available under our policies. To date, this excess has primarily been funded through short-term borrowings. During 2020, we plan to pursue alternatives to these short-term borrowings, which include long-term financing and potential proceeds from the sale of the Massachusetts Business. For additional information, see Note 26, “Subsequent Event,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating Activities

Net cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1,583.3 million, an increase of $1,043.2 million from 2018. This increase was driven primarily by the receipt of $795 million of insurance recoveries in 2019 related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and approximately $220 million lower cash spend for the Greater Lawrence Incident in 2019. Refer to Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to the Greater Lawrence Incident. 

Pension and Other Postretirement Plan Funding. In 2019, we contributed $2.9 million to our pension plans and $23.0 million to our other postretirement benefit plans. In 2018, we contributed $2.9 million to our pension plans and $21.0 million to our other postretirement benefit plans. Given the current funded status of the pension plans, and barring unforeseen market volatility that may negatively impact the valuation of our plan assets, we do not believe additional material contributions to our pension plans will be required for the foreseeable future. 

Income Taxes. Rates for our regulated customers include provisions for the collection of U.S. federal income taxes. The reduction in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of the TCJA led to a decrease in the amount billed to customers through rates, ultimately resulting in lower cash collections from operating activities. In addition, we are required to pass back to customers “excess deferred taxes” which represent amounts collected from customers in the past to cover deferred tax liabilities which, as a result of the passage of the TCJA, are now less than the originally billed amounts. Approximately $1.5 billion of excess deferred taxes was recorded as a regulatory liability as of December 31, 2017 as a result of implementing the TCJA. The majority of this balance related to temporary book-to-tax differences on utility property protected by IRS normalization rules; this portion of the excess deferred taxes balance will be passed back to customers over the remaining average useful life of the associated property as required by the TCJA. The remainder of the excess deferred tax balance is passed back over periods determined by our state utility commissions. The pass back of excess deferred taxes has been approved in all our jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, we have approximately $1.3 billion of remaining regulatory liabilities associated with excess deferred taxes.

As of December 31, 2019, we have a deferred tax asset of $657.1 million related to a federal NOL carryforward, of which $406.1 million relates to years prior to the implementation of the TCJA. As a result of being in an NOL position, we were not required to make any cash payments for federal income tax purposes during the three years ended December 31, 2019. The carryforward periods for pre-TCJA tax benefits expire in various tax years from 2028 to 2037; however, we expect to fully utilize the carryforward benefit prior to its expiration. According to the TCJA, utilization of NOL carryforwards generated after December 31, 2017 do not expire but are limited to 80% of current year taxable income. Accordingly, we may be required to make cash payments for federal income taxes in future years despite having NOL carryforwards in excess of current taxes payable.

Investing Activities

Our cash used for investing activities varies year over year primarily as a result of changes in the level of annual capital expenditures. The table below reflects capital expenditures and certain other investing activities by segment for 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Corporate and Other capital expenditures were zero in 2018 as specific IT assets were leased in 2018. Certain IT and other maintenance related assets were purchased in 2017 and 2019. 

(2)Amounts differ from those presented on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows primarily due to the capitalized portion of the Corporate Incentive Plan payout, inclusion of capital expenditures included in current liabilities and AFUDC Equity. 

(3) The 2018 capital expenditures for Gas Distribution Operations reflects reclassifying the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement from system growth and tracker to maintenance.

For 2019, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,867.8 million, which was $53.2 million higher than the 2018 capital program. This increased spending is primarily due to growth, safety and system modernization projects.

For 2018, capital expenditures and certain other investing activities were $1,814.6 million, which was $60.8 million higher than the 2017 capital program. This increased spending is due in part to costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident pipeline replacement, gas transmission projects, environmental investments and system modernization projects across all seven states in our operating area.

For 2020, we project to invest approximately $1.8 to $1.9 billion in our capital program. This projected level of spend is consistent with 2019 spend levels and is expected to focus on growth, safety, and modernization projects across our operating area.

The following table displays NiSource's liquidity position as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Represents the lesser of the seasonal limit or maximum borrowings supportable by the underlying receivables.

Debt Covenants. We are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement, which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. A similar covenant in a 2005 private placement note purchase agreement requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 75%. As of December 31, 2019, the ratio was 61.7%.

Sale of Trade Accounts Receivables. Refer to Note 18, “Transfers of Financial Assets,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on the sale of trade accounts receivable.

Credit Ratings. The credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile. The following table includes our and certain of our subsidiaries' credit ratings and ratings outlook as of December 31, 2019. 

A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Certain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if our credit ratings or the credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are below investment grade. These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. As of December 31, 2019, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $72.1 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. 

Equity. Our authorized capital stock consists of 620,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 600,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. As of December 31, 2019, 382,135,680 shares of common stock and 440,000 shares of preferred stock were outstanding. For more information regarding our common and preferred stock, see Note 12, "Equity," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Contractual Obligations. We have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long-term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and outsourcing of IT services. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2019 and their maturities were:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Long-term debt balance excludes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of $70.5 million. 

(2) Finance lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $108.3 million.  

(3) Operating lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $14.3 million. Operating lease balances do not include obligations for possible fleet vehicle lease renewals beyond the initial lease term. While we have the ability to renew these leases beyond the initial term, we are not reasonably certain (as that term is defined in ASC 842) to do so. If we were to continue the fleet vehicle leases outstanding at December 31, 2019, payments would be $34.5 million in 2020, $28.3 million in 2021, $23.4 million in 2022, $19.9 million in 2023, $15.2 million in 2024 and $15.2 million thereafter.  

(4)In January 2020, NIPSCO signed new coal contract commitments of $14.4 million for 2020. These contracts are not included above.  

(5)In February 2020, NIPSCO signed a new railcar coal transportation contract commitment of $12.0 million for 2020. This contract is not included above. 

Our calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt is based on the stated coupon and payment dates. For 2020, we project that we will be required to make interest payments of approximately $368.2 million, which includes $342.0 million of interest payments related to our long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2019, we had $1,773.2 million in short-term borrowings outstanding.

Our expected payments included within “Other liabilities” in the table of contractual commitments above contains employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2020. Plan contributions beyond 2020 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. In 2020, we expect to make contributions of approximately $3.0 million to our pension plans and approximately $24.0 million to our postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 11, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

We cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to long-term obligations classified as “Total Other Liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, other than those described above.

We also have obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, payroll, sales and use, and various other taxes and expect to make tax payments of approximately $247.1 million in 2020, which are not included in the table above. In addition, we have uncertain income tax positions that are not included in the table above as we are unable to predict when the matters will be resolved. Refer to Note 10, "Income Taxes," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Refer to Note 19-A, “Contractual Obligations,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

In January 2019, NIPSCO executed two 20 year PPAs to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. Payments under the PPAs will not begin until the associated generation facilities are constructed by the owner / seller which is currently scheduled to be complete by the end of 2020 for one facility. Payments that will be made under the agreements are not included in the table of contractual commitments above as there are no minimum payment obligations under the agreements. NIPSCO has filed a notice with the IURC of its intention not to move forward with one of its approved PPAs due to the failure to meet a condition precedent in the agreement as a result of local zoning restrictions. See Note 19-E, “Other Matters - NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

In January 2019, NIPSCO executed a BTA with a developer to construct a renewable generation facility with a nameplate capacity of approximately 100 MW; construction of the facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. In October 2019, NIPSCO

executed a BTA with a developer to construct an additional renewable generation facility with a nameplate capacity of approximately 300 MW; construction of this facility is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. Payments under these agreements are not included in the table of contractual commitments as NIPSCO's purchase requirement under these BTAs is dependent on satisfactory approval of the BTAs by the IURC, successful execution of agreements with a tax equity partner, and timely completion of construction. See Note 19-E, “Other Matters - NIPSCO 2018 Integrated Resource Plan,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We, along with certain of our subsidiaries, enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.

Refer to Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about such arrangements.

Market Risk Disclosures

Risk is an inherent part of our businesses. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Risk management for us is a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.

Commodity Price Risk

We are exposed to commodity price risk as a result of our subsidiaries’ operations involving natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. We do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.

Commodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. If states should explore additional regulatory reform, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. 

Our subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.

Refer to Note 9, "Risk Management Activities," in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, term loan agreement and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $19.0 million and $13.3 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively. We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances. 

Refer to Note 9, "Risk Management Activities," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Credit Risk

Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.

We closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers. We evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.

Other Information

Critical Accounting Policies

We apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements.

Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries. ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,239.6 million and $2,512.2 million at December 31, 2019, and $2,237.5 million and $2,660.0 million at December 31, 2018, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 8, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations, we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20, Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, Regulated Operations for the foreseeable future.

Certain of the regulatory assets reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. Regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to $307.2 million at December 31, 2019. If we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.

The passage of the TCJA into law in December 2017 necessitated the remeasurement of our deferred income tax balances to reflect the change in the statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21%. For our regulated entities, substantially all of the impact of this remeasurement was recorded to a regulatory liability and is being passed backed to customers, as established during the rate making process. For additional information, refer to Note 8, "Regulatory Matters," and Note 10, "Income Taxes," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As discussed in Note 19-E, "Other Matters - Greater Lawrence Pipeline Replacement," since the Greater Lawrence Incident and through December 31, 2019, we have invested approximately $258 million of capital spend for the pipeline replacement in the affected communities; this work was completed in 2019. We maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property. Columbia of Massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the full cost of the pipeline replacement. In January 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer, seeking payment of our property claim. We are currently unable 

45
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NISOURCE INC.

to predict the timing or amount of any insurance recovery under the property policy. The recovery of any capital investment not reimbursed through insurance will be addressed in a future regulatory proceeding; a future regulatory proceeding is dependent on the outcome of the sale of the Massachusetts Business. The outcome of such a proceeding (if any) is uncertain. In accordance with ASC 980-360, if it becomes probable that a portion of the pipeline replacement cost will not be recoverable through customer rates and an amount can be reasonably estimated, we will reduce our regulated plant balance for the amount of the probable disallowance and record an associated charge to earnings. This could result in a material adverse effect to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, if a rate order is received allowing recovery of the investment with no or reduced return on investment, a loss on disallowance may be required.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits. We have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into AOCI or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. These deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in GAAP as the “corridor” method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.

The discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. While a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.

The discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. Our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an AA-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. 

For measurement of 2020 net periodic benefit cost, we selected an expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 5.70% and 5.67% for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively. 

We estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions. 

We use the Society of Actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. 

46
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NISOURCE INC.

The following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Before labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals.

In January 2017, we changed the method used to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits. This change, compared to the previous method, resulted in a decrease in the actuarially-determined service and interest cost components. Historically, we estimated service and interest cost utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. For fiscal 2017 and beyond, we now utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate these components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 11, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We have seven goodwill reporting units, comprised of the seven state operating companies within the Gas Distribution Operations reportable segment. Our goodwill assets at December 31, 2019 were $1,486 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000. 

As required by GAAP, we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. Our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on May 1, 2019. A qualitative ("step 0") test was completed on May 1, 2019 for all reporting units other than our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. In the Step 0 analysis, we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to their baseline May 1, 2016 “step 1” fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that these reporting units fair values are less than their reporting unit carrying values; therefore, no “step 1” analysis was required.

The results of our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit were negatively impacted by the Greater Lawrence Incident (see Note 19-C, "Legal Proceedings," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). As a result, we completed a quantitative "step 1" analysis for the May 1, 2019 goodwill analysis for this reporting unit. Consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of this reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. These approaches require significant judgments including appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach. The discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. The discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit and general economic conditions. The long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. The long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to 

47
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

NISOURCE INC.

the U.S. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates. The Step 1 analysis performed indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. As a result, no impairment charge was recorded as of the May 1, 2019 test date.

Although our annual impairment test is performed during the second quarter, we continue to monitor changes in circumstances that may indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting units is less than the reporting unit carrying value. During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed matters related to Columbia of Massachusetts. While there was no single determinative event or factor, the consideration in totality of several factors that developed during the fourth quarter of 2019 led us to conclude that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. These factors included: (i) increased Massachusetts DPU regulatory enforcement activity related to Columbia of Massachusetts during the fourth quarter, including (a) an order imposing work restrictions on Columbia of Massachusetts, impacting Columbia of Massachusetts' infrastructure replacement program, (b) two orders opening public investigations into Columbia of Massachusetts related to the Greater Lawrence Incident and restoration efforts following the incident, and (c) an order defining the scope of the Massachusetts DPU's investigation into the preparation and response of Columbia of Massachusetts related to the incident; (ii) increased uncertainty as to the ability of Columbia of Massachusetts to execute its growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments, and to obtain timely regulatory outcomes with reasonable rates of return; (iii) further damage to Columbia of Massachusetts' reputation as a result of concerns related to service lines abandoned during the restoration work following the Greater Lawrence Incident and the gas release event in Lawrence, Massachusetts on September 27, 2019; and (iv) a potential sale of the Massachusetts Business. See Note 19, "Other Commitments and Contingencies - C. Legal Proceedings," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding Massachusetts DPU regulatory enforcement activity and Note 26, "Subsequent Event," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the potential sale of the Massachusetts Business.

As a result, a new impairment analysis was required for our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. This analysis used a weighted average of income and market approaches for calculating fair value. The income approach calculated discounted cash flows using updated cash flow projections, discount rates and return on equity assumptions. The market approach applied a combination of comparable company multiples and comparable transactions and used updated cash flow projections. While certain assumptions, such as market multiples, remained unchanged in the year-end test, our cash flow projections, return on equity and rate case timing assumptions were all unfavorably updated at year-end compared to the May 1, 2019 test. The effects of these unfavorable developments were greater than the favorable change in weighted average cost of capital between the two tests. The year-end impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we reduced the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to zero and recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling $204.8 million, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. 

Our intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consist of franchise rights. Franchise rights were identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February 1999 of Columbia of Massachusetts. We review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying amount.

During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of the franchise rights was below its carrying amount. These factors were the same fourth quarter circumstances outlined in the goodwill impairment discussion above. As a result, we performed a year-end impairment test in which we compared the book value of Columbia of Massachusetts to its undiscounted future cash flow and estimated fair value. With this analysis, we determined that the fair value of the franchise rights was zero. Therefore, we wrote off the entire franchise rights book value, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $209.7 million.
