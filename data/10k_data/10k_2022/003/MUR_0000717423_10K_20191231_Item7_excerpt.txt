Item 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Murphy Oil Corporation is a worldwide oil and natural gas exploration and production company. A more detailed description of the Company’s significant assets can be found in Item 1 of this Form 10-K report.

Significant Company operating and financial highlights during 2019 were as follows:

•Completed a $500 million share repurchase program. Total shares issued and outstanding reduced by 20.7 million shares, to 152.9 million shares

•Issued $550 million of 5.875 percent senior notes due 2027, the proceeds of which were used to repurchase an aggregate of approximately $521 million of senior notes due 2022[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Completed an oil-weighted Gulf of Mexico acquisition with LLOG (see Business Review for further details)

•Divested Malaysia operations (classified as discontinued operations) and recognized a gain on sale of $985.4 million[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Improved balance sheet strength with approximately 31.3% net debt to total capital 1 

Throughout this section, the term, ‘excluding noncontrolling interest’ or ‘excluding NCI’ refers to amounts attributable to Murphy.

Murphy’s continuing operations generate revenue by producing crude oil, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas in the United States, Gulf of Mexico and Canada and then selling these products to customers. The Company’s revenue is affected by the prices of crude oil, natural gas and NGL. In order to make a profit and generate cash in its exploration and production business, revenue generated from the sales of oil and natural gas produced must exceed the combined costs of producing these products, depreciation of capital expenditures, and expenses related to exploration, administration, and for capital borrowed from lending institutions and note holders.

Changes in the price of crude oil and natural gas have a significant impact on the profitability of the Company. In 2019 liquids from continuing operations represented 66% of total hydrocarbons produced from continuing operations on an energy equivalent basis. In 2020, the Company’s ratio of hydrocarbon production represented by liquids is expected to be 67%. If the prices for crude oil and natural gas are lower in 2020 or beyond, this will have an unfavorable impact on the Company’s operating profits. The Company, from time to time, may choose to use a variety of commodity hedge instruments to reduce commodity price risk, including forward sale fixed financial swaps and long-term fixed-price physical commodity sales.

Oil prices weakened in 2019 compared to the 2018 period. The sales price of a barrel of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $57.03 in 2019, $64.77 in 2018, and $50.95 in 2017. The WTI index decreased approximately 12% over the prior year.

Murphy’s realized crude oil price is generally higher than WTI due to sales of crude oil at/off other market points/prices. The most common crude oil indices used to price the Company’s crude include Magellan East Houston (MEH), Louisiana Light Sweet (LLS), Mars, and Brent.

The NYMEX natural gas price per million British Thermal Units (MMBTU) averaged $2.52 in 2019, $3.12 in 2018 and $2.96 in 2017. The 2019 NYMEX natural gas price was lower compared to the 2018 price. NYMEX natural gas prices in 2018 were marginally better than the 2017 price. On an energy equivalent basis, the market continued to discount North American natural gas and NGL compared to crude oil in 2019. Natural gas prices in North America in 2020 have thus far been below the average 2019 levels.

1 Total capital for purposes of this calculation is Murphy shareholders’ equity plus long-term debt less cash.

Results of Operations

Murphy Oil’s results of operations, with associated diluted earnings per share (EPS), for the last three years are presented in the following table.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Results of continuing operations before taxes in 2019 were improved versus 2018, whereas income from continuing operations attributable to Murphy of $85.2 million ($0.52 per diluted share) decreased from income of $160.7 million ($0.92 per diluted share) in 2018. Murphy Oil’s net income in 2018 included a favorable income tax adjustment of $135.7 million related to the 2017 Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017. The $135.7 million adjustment, primarily related to the reinstatement of a deferred tax asset for 2017 net operating losses, which in 2017, was assumed utilized against the deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings.

The results before income tax for 2019 were improved compared to 2018 and favorably impacted by higher revenues (due to higher volumes), lower losses on crude contracts, lower impairment losses; partially offset by lower gain on sale of assets, higher lease operating expenses, higher transportation, gathering and processing expenses, higher depreciation expenses and higher interest charges. Higher lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses and higher depreciation expenses are principally a result of the LLOG acquisition and a full year of the 2018 MP GOM transactions completed in the fourth quarter of 2019. See Exploration and Production section below for further details on 2019 results.

In 2019, income from the Company’s discontinued operations was $1,064.5 million, primarily resulting from the gain on sale of the Malaysia business.

Murphy Oil’s net income in 2018 vs net loss in 2017 was favorably impacted by higher revenues due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices and volumes, higher other operating income (vs 2017 other operating expense, lower exploration expenses, and a favorable income tax adjustment related to the 2017 Tax Act; partially offset by losses on crude contracts, lower gain on sale of assets, higher lease operating expenses and higher depreciation. 

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted into legislation the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (2017 Tax Act). For the year ended December 31, 2017, Murphy recorded a tax expense of $274.0 million directly related to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act. The charge includes the impact of a deemed repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings and the re-measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Other key performance metrics

The Company uses other operational performance and income metrics to review operational performance. The table below presents Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and adjusted EBITDA. Management uses EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA internally to evaluate the Company’s operational performance and trends between periods and relative to its industry competitors. EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered a substitute for Net income (loss) or Cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also presented below is adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold. Management uses EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold to evaluate the Company’s profitability of one barrel of oil equivalent sold in the period. Adjusted EBITDA per barrel of oil equivalent sold is a non-GAAP financial metric.

Exploration and Production

Please refer to Schedule 6 – Results of Operations for Oil and Natural Gas Producing Activities in the Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Information section for supporting tables.

2019 vs 2018 

All amounts include amount attributable to a noncontrolling interest in MP GOM and exclude discontinued operations, unless otherwise noted. Also note that weighted average realized prices are reported excluding transportation, gathering and processing costs. Comparative periods are conformed to current presentation. 

Exploration and production (E&P) continuing operations recorded a profit of $460.6 million in 2019 compared to a profit of $277.4 million in 2018. The results for 2019 were favorably impacted by higher oil and natural gas volumes, lower exploration expenses, and no impairment charge, partially offset by higher lease operating expenses and transportation, gathering and processing expenses, higher general and administrative expenses, higher depreciation expense, and higher taxes. See below for further details.

Crude oil price realizations averaged $60.27 per barrel in the current year compared to $65.87 per barrel in 2018, a price decrease of 9% year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged $2.45 in the current year compared to $3.18 per MCF in 2018, a price decrease of 23% year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged U.S. $1.60 in the current year compared to U.S. $1.71 per MCF in 2018, a price decrease of 6% year over year. Oil and natural gas production costs, including associated production taxes, on a per-unit basis, were $9.66 in 2019 excluding TGP (2018: $9.02), which together with higher oil and natural gas volumes sold, resulted in $247.2 million higher costs in 2019.

United States E&P operations reported earnings of $518.4 million in 2019 compared to income of $242.9 million in 2018. Results were $275.5 million favorable in 2019 compared to the 2018 period due to higher revenues ($1,034.3 million), partially offset by higher depreciation, depletion and amortization ($359.2 million), lease operating expenses ($231 million), transportation, gathering, and processing ($97.7 million), income tax expense ($47.5 million), other operating expense ($29.2 million) and general and administrative (G&A: $25.3 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher volumes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (as a result of the MP GOM transaction in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the LLOG acquisition in the second quarter of 2019). Higher lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses and depreciation expense were due primarily to higher volumes. Higher income taxes were due to higher profits. Higher other operating expense was due to higher business development, acquisition transaction costs and mark to market valuation on contingent consideration. Higher G&A was due to higher long-term incentive charges. 

Canadian E&P operations reported a loss of $4.3 million in 2019 compared to income of $51.1 million in 2018. Results were unfavorable $55.4 million compared to the 2018 period primarily due to lower revenue ($23.5 million), higher lease operating expense ($19.8 million), lower other income ($13.0 million) primarily related to more Seal insurance proceeds received in 2018; and partially offset by lower income tax charges ($17.4 million). Lower revenues were due to lower oil and condensate prices than the prior year and a shut-in at Hibernia in the third quarter, partially offset by higher volumes at Kaybob Duvernay and Tupper Montney. Higher lease operating expenses were due to higher costs at Tupper Montney as a result of transferring a gain on a previous natural gas processing plant sale and lease-back transaction to equity as a result of the implementation of ASC 842 (see Note B). In 2018, this gain was being credited to operating expenses equally over the life of the lease. 

Other international E&P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of $53.5 million in 2019 compared to a net loss of $16.6 million in the prior year. The 2019 result included the write-off of previously suspended exploration costs of $13.2 million attributable to the CM-1X and the CT-1X wells (originally drilled in 2017) in Vietnam and lower revenues from Brunei ($10.6 million), and lower tax benefits ($12.9 million).

Exploration and Production (Contd.)

2018 vs 2017

E&P continuing operations recorded a profit of $277.4 million in 2018 compared to a profit of $63.2 million in 2017. The results for 2018 were favorably impacted by higher revenues due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices and volumes, lower gain on sale of assets, lower other exploration expenses, and lower other operating expenses, partially offset by higher lease operating expenses, higher depreciation expense, non-recurring impairment expense in 2018 and higher taxes.

Crude oil price realizations averaged $65.87 per barrel in the current year compared to $51.51 per barrel in 2017, a price increase of 28% year over year. U.S. natural gas realized price per thousand cubic feet (MCF) averaged $3.18 in 2018 compared to $2.96 per MCF in 2017, a price increase of 7% year over year. Canada natural gas realized price per MCF averaged U.S.$1.71 in the current year compared to U.S. $2.11 per MCF in 2017, a price decrease of 19% year over year. Oil and natural gas production costs, including associated production taxes, on a per-unit basis, were $9.02 in 2018 (2017: $8.52), which together with higher oil and natural gas volumes sold, resulted in $62.9 million higher costs in 2018.

United States E&P operations reported earnings of $242.9 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $12.1 million in 2017. Results were $255.0 million favorable in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period due to higher revenues ($360.0 million), lower depreciation ($26.8 million), and lower G&A ($12.9 million), partially offset by higher lease operating expenses ($32.1 million), higher dry hole costs ($17.9 million, primarily related to the write-off of the King Cake well in the Gulf of Mexico), an impairment charge related to select Midland properties ($20.0 million), and higher income taxes ($65.6 million). Higher revenues were primarily due to higher realized prices and contribution from new volumes from the MP GOM transaction, while lower depreciation expense was due primarily to lower rates and lower volumes sold at Eagle Ford Shale. Higher lease operating expenses were principally a result of higher costs at Front Runner (due to 2017 Clipper well acquisition) and Kodiak work-over costs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico business. Higher exploration expenditures are principally a result of data acquisition costs in the U.S Gulf of Mexico business.

Canadian E&P operations reported earnings of $51.1 million in 2018 compared to earnings of $112.9 million in the 2017 period. Results were unfavorable $61.8 million due to 2017 including a pretax gain of $132.4 million (after tax: $96.0 million) related to the sale of Seal heavy oil assets in Canada in January 2017. Adjusting for the impact of gain on sale of assets, Canadian results of operations improved $34.6 million in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period due to higher revenue ($85.5 million), and insurance proceeds ($21.3 million), partially offset by higher lease operating expense ($21.6 million), higher depreciation ($47.1 million) and higher taxes ($6.5 million). Higher revenues were a result of both higher volumes at the Tupper Montney, Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets and higher realized crude prices. Insurance proceeds related to cash received in relation to the spill at the now divested Seal asset. Higher taxes (excluding the Seal gain in 2017) are the result of higher net earnings. Higher lease operating expenses and depreciation are a result of higher volumes sold. 

Other international E&P operations reported a loss from continuing operations of $16.6 million in 2018 compared to a net loss of $37.6 million in the 2017 period. The loss was $21.0 million lower in the 2018 period versus 2017 primarily due to the recording of past profits ($21.6 million) relating to the working interest in Block CA1 in Brunei, and lower exploration costs ($16.2 million), partially offset by lower tax benefits on investments in foreign areas ($18.2 million). The Brunei income follows the signing of the Brunei participation agreement on July 4, 2018, which enables the Company the right to claim its proportional share of revenue since inception as well as the obligation to settle the related past operating and capital expenditure costs since inception. In addition, ongoing current Brunei revenue is now being reported.

2019 vs 2018 

Total hydrocarbon production from continuing operations averaged 185,649 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, which represented a 49% increase from the 124,337 barrels per day produced in 2018. The increase is principally due to the acquisition of producing Gulf of Mexico assets as part of the MP GOM transaction in the fourth quarter 2018 and the addition of further Gulf of Mexico assets as part of the LLOG acquisition in the second quarter of 2019.

Average crude oil and condensate production from continuing operations was 114,742 barrels per day in 2019 compared to 63,438 barrels per day in 2018. The increase of 51,304 barrels per day was principally due to higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (48,121 barrels per day) due to the acquisition of assets as part of the MP GOM transaction and the LLOG acquisition On a worldwide basis, the Company’s crude oil and condensate prices averaged $60.27 per barrel in 2019 compared to $65.87 per barrel in 2018, a decrease of 9% year over year.

Total production of natural gas liquids (NGL) from continuing operations was 11,888 barrels per day in 2019 compared to 8,798 barrels per day in the 2018 period. The average sales price for U.S. NGL was $14.85 per barrel in 2019 compared to $26.12 per barrel in 2018. The average sales price for NGL in Canada was $26.04 per barrel in 2019 compared to $37.47 per barrel in 2018. NGL prices are higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets.

Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 354 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) in 2019 compared to 313 MMCFD in 2018. The increase of 42 MMCFD was a primarily the result of higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico (38 MMCFD). Higher volumes in the Gulf of Mexico are due to the acquisition of assets related to the MP GOM transaction and the LLOG acquisition.

Natural gas prices for the total Company averaged $1.80 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2019 , versus $1.93 per MCF average in 2018. Average prices in the U.S. and Canada in 2019 were $2.45 and $1.60 respectively.

2018 vs 2017

Total hydrocarbon production from continuing operations averaged 124,337 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, which represented a 12% increase from the 110,892 barrels per day produced in 2017. The increase in crude oil production year over year was primarily due to new drilling and the acquisition of properties relating to the MP GOM transaction. 

Average crude oil and condensate production from continuing operations was 63,438 barrels per day in 2018 compared to 57,445 barrels per day in 2017. The increase in crude oil production year over year was primarily due to new drilling and the acquisition of properties relating to the MP GOM transaction. On a worldwide basis, the Company’s crude oil and condensate prices averaged $65.87 per barrel in 2018 compared to $51.51 per barrel in 2017, an increase of 28% year over year.

Total production of natural gas liquids (NGL) from continuing operations was 8,798 barrels per day in 2018 compared to 8,322 per day in 2017. The average sales price for U.S. NGL was $26.12 per barrel in 2018 compared to $20.85 per barrel in 2017. The average sales price of NGL in Canada was $37.47 per barrel in 2018 compared to $29.64 per barrel in 2017. NGL prices are higher in Canada due to the higher value of product produced at the Kaybob Duvernay and Placid Montney assets.

Natural gas sales volumes from continuing operations averaged 313 million cubic feet per day (MMCFD) in 2018 compared to 271 MMCFD in 2017. The increase of 42 MMCFD was attributable to an 18% increase in natural gas production in Canada, primarily in Tupper Montney and Placid Montney areas as well as an increase in natural gas production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 

Natural gas prices for the total Company averaged $1.93 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) in 2018, versus $2.25 per MCF average in 2017. Average prices in the U.S. and Canada in 2018 were $3.18 and $2.96 respectively.

Results of Operations (Contd.)

Corporate

2019 vs 2018 

Corporate activities, which include interest expense and income, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains/losses on crude oil contracts and corporate overhead not allocated to Exploration and Production, reported a net loss of $271.8 million in 2019 compared to net loss of $108.3 million in 2018. The $163.5 million unfavorable variance is due to a 2018 income tax credit ($120.0 million, related to an IRS interpretation of the Tax Act), higher interest charges ($38.6 million) primarily due to early retirement of debt, foreign exchange losses ($6.6 million; versus an $16.1 million gain in 2018), Ecuador arbitration income in 2018 ($26.0 million); partially off-set by lower losses on forward crude contracts ($41.1 million) and lower income taxes (excluding the $120 million tax act credit; $22.1 million).

2018 vs 2017

Corporate activities, which include interest income and expense, foreign exchange effects, realized and unrealized gains/losses on crude oil contracts and corporate overhead not allocated to operating functions, reported a net loss of $108.3 million in 2018 compared to a loss of $616.2 million in 2017. The $507.9 million favorable variance in 2018 was primarily due to a credit to income tax expense of $135.7 million primarily related to an IRS interpretation of the 2017 Tax Act (versus a charge in 2017 of $274.0 million), lower foreign exchange losses ($16.1 million gain in 2018 versus an $82.4 million loss in 2017), and income related to an Ecuador arbitration settlement ($26.0 million), partially offset by losses on crude contracts used to hedge price risk ($42.0 million) versus a gain in the prior period ($9.5 million), and higher G&A expense ($6.9 million). Further, the 2017 period included a deferred tax charge of $65.2 million associated with the estimated tax consequence of future repatriation of Malaysian and Canadian earnings that were deemed no longer indefinitely invested. 

Discontinued Operations

The Company has presented its Malaysia E&P operations and former U.K. and U.S. refining and marketing operations as discontinued operations in its consolidated financial statements. 

Malaysia E&P operations reported earnings of $1,086.6 million in 2019 compared to $251.7 million in the 2018 period. Results for 2019 were favorable by $834.9 million primarily as a result of the gain on sale of Malaysia to PTT Exploration and Production Public Company Limited (PTTEP) (see Note G). The sale closed on July 10, 2019. The Company recognized a net gain of $985.4 million on the transaction. Excluding the gain, Malaysia income was $168.2 million lower than the 2018 period principally due to lower revenues ($486.4 million), partially offset by lower operating expenses ($74.9 million), lower depreciation ($164.9 million) and lower income taxes ($73.1 million). Lower revenues are principally due to lower volumes sold as a result of a partial year of operations and declining daily production. The lower depreciation is due to the cessation of charges as a result of the assets being classified as held for sale and partial year of operations.

2018 vs 2017

Malaysia E&P operations reported earnings of $269.5 million in 2018, compared to earnings of $224.2 million in 2017. Results were favorable by $45.3 million due to higher revenues ($73.1 million), lower depreciation ($6.0 million), and lower redetermination/unitization expense ($3.7 million), partially offset by higher lease operating expenses ($33.3 million), and higher taxes ($16.9 million). Higher revenues are principally due to higher realized prices, partially offset by lower volumes sold. Lower depreciation is due to lower volumes sold. Lower other expenses are due to the cost of a rig exit recorded in 2017. Higher lease operating expenses are due to higher platform, onshore facility and sub-sea maintenance costs. The higher taxes are due to higher pre-tax profits. The redetermination/unitization charges (in both years) relates to the executed unitization agreement for the Gumusut-Kakap (GK) and Geronggong/Jagus East fields originally signed in Q4 2017.

Financial Condition

Cash Provided by Operating Activities

Net cash provided by continuing operating activities was $1,489.1 million in 2019 compared to $749.4 million in 2018. The $739.7 million improvement in cash provided by continuing operations activities in 2018 was primarily attributable to higher sales ($1,010.6 million) from higher volumes, realized gains on forward crude contracts (vs 2018 losses; $108.4 million), partially off-set by higher lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses ($352.6 million). Higher revenues, lease operating, transportation, gathering and processing expenses and higher depreciation expenses are principally a result of the LLOG acquisition and a full year of the 2018 MP GOM transaction, which was completed in the fourth quarter 2018.

Cash flow provided by continuing operations was $136.0 million higher in 2018 than in 2017 due to higher realized oil and natural gas sales prices, partially offset by higher cash taxes paid as a result of repatriating cash from Canada and payments made on hedge losses.

The total reductions of operating cash flows for interest paid during the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were $179.7 million, $158.1 million, and $144.5 million, respectively. Higher cash interest paid in 2019 was due to maintaining a higher average outstanding revolver balance 2019 (timing of LLOG acquisition and Malaysia disposition) and also the cost of the $500 million term loan outstanding from May to July 2019.

Cash Used for Investing Activities

Cash used for property additions and dry holes, which includes amounts expensed, were $1,344.3 million and $1,011.3 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase is due to exploration and development capital expenditures at the Eagle Ford Shale and Gulf of Mexico in the U.S. and Kaybob Duvernay in Canada. Cash used for acquisition of oil and natural gas properties was $1,212.3 million in 2019 compared to $794.6 million in 2018. In 2019 and 2018 the Company acquired certain Gulf of Mexico assets attributable to the LLOG and MP GOM acquisitions, respectively (see business review section).

The accrual basis of capital expenditures, which includes $1,261.1 million for proved property acquisitions (principally the LLOG acquisition) in 2019 and the $794.6 million MP GOM acquisition in 2018, were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A reconciliation of property additions and dry hole costs in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to total capital expenditures for continuing operations follows.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Proceeds from sales of property and equipment generated cash of $20.4 million in 2019 compared to $1.2 million in 2018 primarily relating to the proceeds from the sale of certain non-core assets in the Midland basin in 2019. 

Cash Used by and Provided by Financing Activities

During 2019, net cash used by financing activities was $1,130.0 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $143.6 million during 2018. In 2019, the cash provided by financing activities was principally from borrowings on our revolver and short-term loan ($1,725.0 million) to fund the LLOG acquisition (see above). These borrowings, along with the opening revolver balance ($325.0 million) of $2,050.0 million were repaid in July 2019 following the completion of the

Financial Condition (Contd.)

Malaysia divestment. The Company issued $550 million notes due December 2027 that bear a rate of 5.875%, for net proceeds of $542.4 million; these proceeds were used to redeem a portion of the Company’s $500 million 4.00% notes due June 2022 and a portion of the Company’s $600 million 4.45% notes due December 2022 ($521.3 million in the aggregate). The Company paid an early retirement premium of $26.6 million in relation to the retirement of the debt. Finally, in 2019, the Company also used cash to buy back issued ordinary shares of $499.9 million. 

During 2018, the Company borrowed $325.0 million on its revolving credit facility to partially fund the MP GOM transaction, which was fully repaid following the completion of the Malaysia divestment in 2019.

During 2017 the Company issued $550 million notes in August 2017 that bear a rate of 5.75% and mature on August 15, 2025, for net proceeds of $541.6 million; these proceeds were used to redeem the Company’s $550 million 3.50% notes in September 2017. The 3.50% notes had a maturity date of December 2017 and were retired early. 

Total cash dividends to shareholders amounted to $163.7 million in 2019, $173.0 million in 2018, and $172.6 million in 2017. Lower cash dividends in 2019 were the result of lower shares outstanding as a result of the share buy-back.

Working Capital

At the end of 2019, working capital (total current assets less total current liabilities - excluding assets and liabilities held for sale) amounted to a net working capital liability of $79.0 million (2018: net working capital asset of $146.3 million). The total working capital decrease in 2019 is primarily attributable to higher accounts payable ($254.1 million), higher current operating lease liabilities ($92.3 million), lower cash ($53.2 million); and partially offset by higher accounts receivable ($195.0 million). Higher accounts receivables and accounts payable are principally due to the increase in activity (both operating and capital) from the LLOG and MP GOM transactions. The higher operating lease liabilities is due to the implementation of ASC 842, Leases (see Note B). 

Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 totaled $306.8 million (2018: $359.9 million). The decrease in 2019 is a function of the business activity described above under cash provided by operating activities, cash used for investing activities and cash provided by (used by) financing activities (which includes a $499.9 million buy back of issued ordinary shares). The decrease in cash from 2017 to 2018 was primarily related to the use of cash on hand to fund the MP GOM acquisition at the end of 2018. 

Cash and invested cash are maintained in several operating locations outside the United States. At December 31, 2019, Cash and cash equivalents held outside the U.S. included U.S dollar equivalents of approximately $116.5 million (2018: $223.2 million), the majority of which was held in Canada. In addition, approximately $15.2 million and $10.0 million of cash were held in the U.K. and Brunei, respectively, and have been classified as part of Assets held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at year-end 2019. In certain cases, the Company could incur cash taxes or other costs should these cash balances be repatriated to the U.S. in future periods. Canada currently collects a 5% withholding tax on any earnings repatriated to the U.S. See Note J of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding potential tax expense that could be incurred upon distribution of foreign earnings back to the United States.

Capital Employed

At December 31, 2019, long-term debt of $2,803.4 million was $305.9 million lower than year-end 2018, principally as a result of a lower outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility (prior year balance used to partially fund the MP GOM acquisition and was repaid following the divestment of the Malaysia business in 2019). A summary of capital employed at December 31, 2019 and 2018 follows.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Murphy shareholders’ equity was $5.47 billion at the end of 2019 (2018: $4.83 billion; 2017: $4.62 billion). Shareholders’ equity increased in 2019 and 2018 primarily due to net income earned ($1.15 billion), sale and leaseback gain recognized upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Topic 842 ($0.11 billion); partially off-set by shares repurchased ($0.50 billion) and cash dividends paid ($0.16 billion). Murphy shareholders’ equity increased in 2018 (vs 2017) primarily due to net income earned ($0.41 billion) partially off-set by cash dividends ($0.17 billion). A summary of transactions in stockholders’ equity accounts is presented in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity on page 57 of this Form 10-K report.

Other Balance Sheet Activity

Other significant changes in Murphy’s balance sheet at the end of 2019, compared to 2018 are discussed below.

As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-02, Topic 842, right-of-use assets of $598.3 million, current lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $92.3 million and non-current lease liabilities of $521.3 million are recorded on the balance sheet at the end of 2019.

The increase in deferred income tax liabilities of $77.3 million to $207.2 million is principally a result of the implementation of ASU 2016-02 (see Note B). 

Long-term asset retirement obligations increased $73.3 million to $825.8 million, principally due to increased obligations associated with the LLOG transaction.

Property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation increased $1,537.6 million principally as a result of the LLOG acquisition, capital expenditures in the year, off-set by the depreciation charge for the year. Capital expenditures are discussed above in the ‘Cash Used for Investing Activities’ section.

Murphy had commitments for capital expenditures of approximately $574.5 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: $383.1 million). This amount includes $379.7 million for approved expenditure for capital projects relating to non-operated interests, principally related to development in deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico fields including new fields acquired as part of the MP GOM and LLOG transactions.

The primary sources of the Company’s liquidity are internally generated funds, access to outside financing and working capital. The Company generally uses its internally generated funds to finance its capital and operating expenditures, but it also maintains lines of credit with banks and will borrow as necessary to meet spending requirements. At December 31, 2019, the Company has a $1.6 billion senior unsecured guaranteed credit facility (RCF) with a major banking consortium, which expires in November 2023. 

At December 31, 2019, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the RCF and $3.7 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the borrowing capacity of the RCF. Borrowings under the RCF bear interest at rates, based, at the Company’s option, on the “Alternate Base Rate” of interest in effect plus the “ABR Spread” or the “Adjusted LIBOR Rate,” which is a periodic fixed rate based on LIBOR with a term equivalent to the interest period for such borrowing, plus the “Eurodollar Spread.” The “Alternate Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the New York Federal Reserve Bank Rate plus 0.50%, and (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%. The “Eurodollar Spread” ranges from 1.075% to 2.10% per annum based upon the Corporation’s senior unsecured long-term debt securities credit ratings (the “Credit Ratings”). A facility fee accrues and is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate ranging from 0.175% to 0.40% per annum (based upon the Company’s Credit Ratings) on the aggregate commitments under the 2018 facility. At December 31, 2019, the interest rate in effect on borrowings under the facility was 3.21%. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants related to the RCF.

Current financing arrangements are outlined in more detail in Note H to the consolidated financial statements.

Environmental Matters

Murphy faces various environmental risks that are inherent in exploring for, developing and producing hydrocarbons. To help manage these risks, the Company has established a robust health, safety and environmental governance program comprised of a worldwide policy, guiding principles, annual goals and a management system incorporating oversight at each business unit, senior leadership and board levels. The Company strives to minimize these risks by continually improving its processes through design, operation and implementation of a comprehensive asset integrity plan, and through emergency and oil spill response planning to address any credible risks. These plans are presented to, reviewed and approved by a health, safety and environment committee consisting of certain members of Murphy’s Board of Directors.

The oil and natural gas industry is subject to numerous international, national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations. Murphy allocates a portion of both its capital expenditures and its general and administrative budget to assure compliance with existing and anticipated environmental laws and regulations. These requirements affect virtually all operations of the Company and increase Murphy’s overall cost of business, including its capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities as well as operating costs for ongoing compliance.

The principal environmental laws and regulations to which Murphy is subject address such matters as the generation, storage, handling, use, disposal and remediation of petroleum products, wastewater and hazardous materials, and the emission and discharge of such materials to the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions, wildlife, habitat and water protection and the placement, operation and decommissioning of production equipment. These laws and regulations also generally require 

36
Environmental Matters (Contd.)

permits for existing operations, as well as the construction or development of new operations and the decommissioning facilities once production has ceased. Violations can give rise to sanctions including significant civil and criminal penalties, injunctions, construction bans and delays.

Environmental laws and regulations are subject to frequent change and tend to become more stringent over time. Potential changes in the federal administration create uncertainty in future policy and enforcement. Any current or future air emission requirements applicable to Murphy could curtail operations or otherwise result in operational delays, liabilities and increased costs.

Certain jurisdictions in which the Company operates could require more stringent permitting, including greater transparency, regarding chemical disclosure, water usage, disposal and well construction requirements. Regulators are also becoming increasingly focused on air emissions from the oil and natural gas industry including volatile organic compounds and methane emissions.

Murphy also could be subject to strict liability for environmental contamination in various jurisdictions where we operate including with respect to its current or former properties, operations and waste disposal sites, or those of its predecessors. Contamination has been identified at some locations and the Company has been required, and in the future may be required, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes; or otherwise clean up contaminated soil, surface water or groundwater, address spills and leaks from pipelines and production equipment, and perform remedial plugging operations. In addition to significant investigation and remediation costs, such matters can result in fines and also give rise to third-party claims for personal injury and property or other environmental damage.

Climate Change

Murphy is currently required to report greenhouse gas emissions from its U.S. operations in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in south Texas and in its Canadian onshore business in British Columbia and Alberta. In British Columbia and Alberta, Murphy is subject to a carbon tax on the purchase or use of many carbon-based fuels. Additionally, starting in 2017, a carbon tax began to be applied to certain operations in Alberta. Any limitation on, or further regulation of, greenhouse gases; including through a cap and trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, or expanded reporting requirements, could restrict the Company’s operations, curtail demand for hydrocarbons generally and/or impose increased costs to operate and maintain facilities, install pollution emission controls and administer and manage emissions trading programs.

Safety Matters

The Company is subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) and comparable foreign and state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that certain information regarding hazardous materials used or produced in Murphy’s operations be maintained and provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Company believes that its operations are in substantial compliance with applicable safety and exposure requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping requirements and the monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.

Other Matters

Impact of inflation – General inflation was moderate during the last three years in most countries where the Company operates; however, the Company’s revenues and capital and operating costs are influenced to a larger extent by specific price changes in the oil and natural gas and allied industries than by changes in general inflation. Crude oil prices generally reflect the balance between supply and demand, with crude oil prices being particularly sensitive to OPEC production levels and/or attitudes of traders concerning supply and demand in the future. Prices for oil field goods and services are usually affected by the worldwide prices for crude oil. 

The increase in oil prices in 2017 and 2018 (compared to 2015 to 2016) led to some upward inflation pressure in oil field goods and service costs during those years. In 2019 the cost of goods and services in the oil and natural gas industry were stable.

Natural gas prices are also affected by supply and demand, which are often affected by the weather and by the fact that delivery of natural gas is generally restricted to specific geographic areas.

As a result of the overall volatility of oil and natural gas prices, it is not possible to predict the Company’s future cost of oil field goods and services.

Accounting changes and recent accounting pronouncements – see Note B

37
Other Matters (Contd.)

Significant accounting policies – In preparing the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management must make a number of estimates and assumptions related to the reporting of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Application of certain of the Company’s accounting policies requires significant estimates. The most significant of these accounting policies and estimates are described below.

Oil and natural gas proved reserves – Oil and natural gas proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations before the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire (unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain). Proved developed reserves of oil and natural gas can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared with the cost of a new well, or through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well. 

Although the Company’s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. SEC rules require the Company to use an unweighted average of the oil and natural gas prices in effect at the beginning of each month of the year for determining quantities of proved reserves. These historical prices often do not approximate the average price that the Company expects to receive for its oil and natural gas production in the future. The Company often uses significantly different oil and natural gas price and reserve assumptions when making its own internal economic property evaluations. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start-up or shut-in production, which can lead to revisions to reserves quantities. 

Estimated reserves are subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Reserves revisions inherently lead to adjustments of the Company’s depreciation rates and the timing of settlement of asset retirement obligations. Downward reserves revisions can also lead to significant impairment expense. The Company cannot predict the type of oil and natural gas reserves revisions that will be required in future periods. 

The Company’s proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas are presented on pages 94 to 102 of this Form 10-K report. Murphy’s estimations for proved reserves were generated through the integration of available geoscience, engineering, and economic data, and commercially available technologies, to establish ‘reasonable certainty’ of economic producibility. As defined by the SEC, reasonable certainty of proved reserves describes a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. In estimating proved reserves, Murphy uses familiar industry-accepted methods for subsurface evaluations, including performance, volumetric, and analog-based studies. 

Where appropriate, Murphy includes reliable geologic and engineering technology to estimate proved reserves. Reliable geologic and engineering technology is a method or combination of methods that are field-tested and have demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation. This integrated approach increases the quality of and confidence in Murphy’s proved reserves estimates. It was utilized in certain undrilled acreage at distances greater than the directly offsetting development spacing areas, and in certain reservoirs developed with the application of improved recovery techniques. Murphy utilized a combination of 3D seismic interpretation, core analysis, wellbore log measurements, well test data, historic production and pressure data, and commercially available seismic processing and numerical reservoir simulation programs. Reservoir parameters from analogous reservoirs were used to strengthen the reserves estimates when available.

See further discussion of proved reserves and changes in proved reserves during the three years ended December 31, 2019 beginning on pages 5 and 94 of this Form 10-K report.

Property, Plant & Equipment - impairment of long-lived assets – The Company continually monitors its long-lived assets recorded in Property, plant and equipment (PPE) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its PPE for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows. 

A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the amount of oil and natural gas that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, future capital, operating and abandonment costs, and future inflation levels. 

38
Other Matters (Contd.)

Significant accounting policies (contd.)

The need to test a long-lived asset for impairment can be based on several factors, including but not limited to a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and/or natural gas, unfavorable revisions of oil or natural gas reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations, tax laws or other regulatory changes. All of these factors must be considered when evaluating a property’s carrying value for possible impairment. 

Due to the volatility of world oil and natural gas markets, the actual sales prices for oil and natural gas have often been different from the Company’s projections. 

Estimates of future oil and natural gas production and sales volumes are based on a combination of proved and risked probable and possible reserves. Although the estimation of reserves and future production is uncertain, the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable; however, there have been cases where actual production volumes were higher or lower than projected and the timing was different than the original projection. The Company adjusts reserves and production estimates as new information becomes available. 

The Company generally projects future costs by using historical costs adjusted for both assumed long-term inflation rates and known or expected changes in future operations. Although the projected future costs are considered to be reasonable, at times, costs have been higher or lower than originally estimated. 

The company did not record any impairment expense in 2019 or 2017.

In 2018, the Company recorded an impairment expense of $20.0 million to reduce the carrying value of select Midland properties to its net recoverable value.

Property, Plant & Equipment – business combinations – The Company may acquire assets and assume liabilities in transactions accounted for as business combinations, such as the LLOG acquisition in 2019 and the MP GOM transaction with PAI in 2018. In connection with a business combination, the acquiring company must allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on fair values as of the acquisition date. Any excess of the purchase price over amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. The amount of goodwill or gain on bargain purchase recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

Significant assumptions are involved in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such as the fair values assigned to proved and unproved crude oil and natural gas properties. In most cases, sufficient market data is not available regarding the fair values of proved and unproved properties, and the Company prepares estimates of such properties based on the fair value of associated crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. The primary assumptions used to arrive at estimates of future net cash flows are reserves quantities, commodity prices, and capital and operating costs. For estimated proved reserves, the future net cash flows are discounted using a market-based weighted average cost of capital rate determined at the time of the acquisition. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. To compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves, the discounted future net cash flows of probable and possible reserves are reduced by additional risk-weighting factors.

Estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and loss carryforwards at the acquisition date, although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known.

Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, Murphy reports 100% of the sales volumes, revenues, costs, assets and liabilities including the 20% noncontrolling interest (NCI), of the new Gulf of Mexico transaction (MP GOM) with Petrobras Americas Inc (PAI), in accordance with accounting for noncontrolling interest as prescribed by ASC 810-10-45.

Accounting for retirement and postretirement benefit plans – Murphy and certain of its subsidiaries maintain defined benefit retirement plans covering certain full-time employees. The Company also sponsors health care and life insurance benefit plans covering most retired U.S. employees. The expense associated with these plans is estimated by management based on a number of assumptions and with consultation assistance from qualified third-party actuaries. The most important of these assumptions for the retirement plans involve the discount rate used to measure future plan obligations and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. For the retiree medical and insurance plans, the most important assumptions are the discount rate for future plan obligations and the health care cost trend rate. Discount rates are based on the universe of high-quality corporate bonds that are available within each country. Cash flow analyses are performed in which a spot yield curve is used to discount projected benefit payment streams for the most significant plans. The discounted cash flows are used to determine an equivalent single rate which is the basis for selecting the discount rate within each country. Expected plan asset returns are based on long-term expectations for asset portfolios with similar investment mix characteristics. Anticipated health care cost 

39
Other Matters (Contd.)

Significant accounting policies (contd.)

trend rates are determined based on prior experience of the Company and an assessment of near-term and long-term trends for medical and drug costs. 

Based on bond yields at December 31, 2019, the Company has used a weighted average discount rate of 3.35% at year-end 2019 for the primary U.S. plans. This weighted average discount rate is 1.0% lower than prior year, which increased the Company’s recorded liabilities for retirement plans compared to a year ago. Although the Company presently assumes a return on plan assets of 6.0% for the primary U.S. plan, it periodically reconsiders the appropriateness of this and other key assumptions. The Company’s retirement and postretirement plan expenses in 2020 are expected to be $1.8 million higher than 2019 primarily due to increased amortization of the interest cost component. Cash contributions are anticipated to be $8.2 million higher in 2020. 

In 2019, the Company paid $25.9 million into various retirement plans and $2.3 million into postretirement plans. In 2020, the Company is expecting to fund payments of approximately $31.2 million into various retirement plans and $5.2 million for postretirement plans. The Company could be required to make additional and more significant funding payments to retirement plans in future years. Future required payments and the amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet associated with the plans could be unfavorably affected if the discount rate declines, the actual return on plan assets falls below the assumed return, or the health care cost trend rate increase is higher than expected. 

As described above, the Company’s retirement and postretirement expenses are sensitive to certain assumptions, primarily related to discount rates and assumed return on plan assets. A 0.5% decline in the discount rate would increase 2020 annual retirement expenses by $1.8 million and decrease postretirement expenses by $0.1 million; and a 0.5% decline in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would increase 2020 retirement expense by $2.7 million.

Contractual obligations and guarantees – The Company is obligated to make future cash payments under borrowing arrangements, operating leases, purchase obligations primarily associated with existing capital expenditure plans, and other long-term liabilities. Total payments due after 2019 under such contractual obligations and arrangements are shown in the table below.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1 Other leases refers to a finance lease in Brunei, which is classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2019 (see Note E).

2 Capital expenditures, drilling rigs and other includes $379.7 million in 2020 for approved capital projects in non-operated interests in U.S. onshore and the Gulf of Mexico. Also includes $35.6 million (2020), $102.7 million (2021-2022), $85.5 million (2023-2024) and $285.0 million (After 2024) for pipeline transportation commitments in Canada. Also includes $40.8 million (2020), $106.3 million (2021-2022), $116.4 million (2023-2024) and $706.6 million (After 2024) for long term take or pay commitments relating to gas processing in Canada.

3 Other long-term liabilities, including debt interest includes future cash outflows for asset retirement obligations.

The Company has entered into agreements to lease production facilities for various producing oil fields. In addition, the Company has other arrangements that call for future payments as described in the following section. The Company’s share of the contractual obligations under these leases and other arrangements has been included in the table above.

In the normal course of its business, the Company is required under certain contracts with various governmental authorities and others to provide letters of credit that may be drawn upon if the Company fails to perform under those contracts. Total outstanding letters of credit were $172.5 million as of December 31, 2019.

Material off-balance sheet arrangements – The U.S. transportation contracts require minimum monthly payments through 2044, while Western Canada processing contracts call for minimum monthly payments through 2035. Future required minimum annual payments under these arrangements are included in the contractual obligation table above. 

40
Outlook

Prices for the Company’s primary products are often quite volatile. The price of crude oil is primarily affected by the levels of supply and demand for energy. Anticipated future variances between the predicted demand for crude oil and the projected available supply can lead to significant movement in the price of crude oil. As of February 25, 2020 closing, the NYMEX WTI forward curve price for April through December 2020 was $50. The Company continually monitors the prices for its main products and often alters its operations and spending plans based on these prices.

The Company’s capital expenditure budget for 2020 is expected to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion (excluding noncontrolling interest of $62.0 million). Capital and other expenditures will be routinely reviewed during 2020 and planned capital expenditures may be adjusted to reflect differences between budgeted and actual cash flow during the year. Capital expenditures may also be affected by asset purchases or sales, which often are not anticipated at the time a budget is prepared. The Company will primarily fund its capital program in 2020 using operating cash flow and available cash, but will supplement funding where necessary using borrowings under available credit facilities. If oil and/or natural gas prices weaken, actual cash flow generated from operations could be reduced such that capital spending reductions are required and/or borrowings might be required during the year to maintain funding of the Company’s ongoing development projects.

The Company currently expects average daily production in 2020 to be between 204,200 and 216,200 barrels of oil equivalent per day (including noncontrolling interest of 14,200 BOEPD). 

The Company has entered into natural gas forward delivery contracts to manage risk associated with certain Canadian natural gas sales prices as follows:
