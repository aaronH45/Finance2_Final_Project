PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Company

Boston Scientific Corporation is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to transform lives through innovative medical solutions that improve the health of patients around the world. As a medical technology leader for nearly 40 years, we advance science for life by providing a broad range of high performance solutions to address unmet patient needs and reduce the cost of healthcare. When used in this report, the terms "we," "us," "our" and "the Company" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries. 

Our history began in the late 1960s when our co-founder, John Abele, acquired an equity interest in Medi-tech, Inc., a research and development company focused on developing alternatives to surgery. In 1969, Medi-tech introduced a family of steerable catheters used in some of the world's first less-invasive procedures. In 1979, John Abele joined with Pete Nicholas to form Boston Scientific Corporation, which indirectly acquired Medi-tech. This acquisition began a period of active and focused new product development, innovation, market development and organizational growth. Since then, we have advanced the practice of less-invasive medicine by helping physicians and other medical professionals diagnose and treat a wide range of diseases and medical conditions and improve patients’ quality of life by providing alternatives to surgery and other medical procedures that are typically traumatic to the body. 

Our net sales have increased substantially since our formation. Our growth has been fueled in part by strategic acquisitions designed to improve our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in the medical device industry and to build depth of portfolio within our core businesses. These strategic acquisitions have helped us to add promising new technologies to our pipeline and to offer one of the broadest product portfolios in the world for use in less-invasive procedures in our core areas of Medical Surgical (MedSurg), Rhythm and Neuro, and Cardiovascular. We believe that the depth and breadth of our product portfolio has also enabled us to compete more effectively in the current healthcare environment that seeks to improve outcomes and lower costs. Our strategy of category leadership also enables us to compete in a changing healthcare landscape and position our products with providers and payers, while also expanding internationally and managing the complexities of the global healthcare market. 

Business Strategy

We operate pursuant to five strategic imperatives: Strengthen Category Leadership, Expand into High Growth Adjacencies, Drive Global Expansion, Fund the Journey to Fuel Growth and Develop Key Capabilities. We believe that our execution of these strategic imperatives will drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase stockholder value while strengthening our leadership position in the medical device industry. 

We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and pursue opportunities to diversify and further expand our presence in strategic growth adjacencies and new global markets. Our approach to innovation combines internally-developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions, alliances and other investments. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and all divisions. In the past several years, we have completed numerous acquisitions in support of our growth strategy, both strengthening our core franchises and expanding into high growth adjacent markets.

Our Enterprise Risk Management program analyzes the key risks inherent to achieving our strategic and organizational imperatives. Such risk assessment helps us to anticipate and adapt to potential challenges to preserve and grow stockholder value. Our Board of Directors oversees our risk management program and focuses on monitoring, and together with management, mitigating the most significant risks facing the Company, including strategic, operational, financial, legal and compliance risks.

Products

In 2019, our products were offered for sale by seven core businesses, with 26 percent of our revenue generated by our Interventional Cardiology business, 18 percent by our Cardiac Rhythm Management business, 18 percent by our Endoscopy business, 13 percent by our Urology and Pelvic Health business, 13 percent by our Peripheral Interventions business, eight percent by our Neuromodulation business, and three percent by our Electrophysiology business, with the remaining one percent generated by our recently acquired Specialty Pharmaceuticals business. Our seven core businesses are organized into three reportable segments: MedSurg, Rhythm and Neuro, and Cardiovascular. Following our acquisition of BTG plc (BTG), which closed during the third quarter of 2019, we have included BTG’s Interventional Medicine business within our Peripheral Interventions operating segment, within the Cardiovascular reportable segment. We have presented our full year 2019 results to include BTG's Interventional

Marketing and Sales

In 2019, we marketed our products and solutions to approximately 37,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in more than 120 countries worldwide, including the U.S. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. 

No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2019, 2018 or 2017; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate accounts organization in the U.S. and Europe focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators. We believe that this dual focus on disease state management and hospital administrators enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with both physicians and key service line administrators. We believe that our strong working relationships with physicians, service line administrators and others in the medical industry enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to our customers' changing needs. 

International Operations

International net sales accounted for 42 percent of our net sales in 2019, 44 percent of our net sales in 2018 and 43 percent of our net sales in 2017. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we continue to invest in infrastructure in emerging markets to strengthen our sales and service capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countries.

As of December 31, 2019, we had 9 principal international manufacturing facilities, in addition to our U.S. facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica, one in Brazil, one in Malaysia, one in Puerto Rico and one in Switzerland. Approximately 52 percent of our products manufactured in 2019 were produced at these international facilities. We also maintain our primary research and development capabilities in China, Costa Rica, India, Ireland, Puerto Rico and the UK. Medical education is also a vital component of safe procedure adoption and collaboration with physicians. We continue to provide localized training programs through our 14 Institutes for Advancing Science in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

We are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We strive to improve the efficiency of our sourcing operations and to leverage the technical expertise of the broader market by partnering with strategic suppliers. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and then necessary training and tools for our operations team. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities. 

We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments in supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. Supply chain resiliency also includes sterilization, which is performed and optimized through a combination of internal and third party locations and may also be subject to potential interruptions. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an ongoing program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies, and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers and sterilizers to meet our needs.

 10

Quality Assurance

We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our medical device manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.

Environmental Regulation and Management

We are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that strong performance across relevant environmental, health and safety metrics enhances our competitive strength while benefiting our patients, customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are listed on the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This listing recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies. We also recognize the need to minimize the impact of the manufacturing of our products on the environment and have committed to carbon neutrality in our manufacturing and key distribution sites by 2030. 

We have obtained ISO 14001:2015 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2015 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.

Competition

We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. In certain countries, we face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products, or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products. 

We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a less-invasive manner. We also compete on ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: 

•offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,

•create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,

•apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,

•develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,

 11

•attract and retain skilled personnel, 

•obtain patent or other protection for our products,

Medical Device Regulatory Approvals

The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device. 

In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.

The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.

The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). A HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.

In the European Union (EU), we will be required to comply with the new Medical Device Regulation (MDR or EU MDR) effective May 2020 which will supersede the current Medical Device Directives. Medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the current Directives (issued before May 2020) can continue to be sold until May 2024 or until the CE Certificate expires, whichever comes first, providing there are no significant changes to the design or intended use. The MDR was published in May 2017 with a 3-year transition period. The CE Mark required to sell medical devices in the EU is affixed following conformity assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification by the manufacturer. The selected pathway to CE marking is based on product risk classification. CE Marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements of the relevant Medical Devices Directive and in the future to the General Safety and Performance Requirements for the new MDR. The MDR will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework for CE marking, such as increased clinical evidence requirements and other new requirements, including Unique Device Identification (UDI) as well as many other post-market obligations. MDR also significantly modifies and increases the compliance requirements for the industry and will require significant investment over the next few years to implement. 

We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch or maintain new products on the market, such as the requirements that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW), the Japanese Pharmaceutical & Medical Device Agency (PMDA) and the China Food and Drug Administration (NMPA). Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or had minimal regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of expanding its current regulations to include all medical device categories while many countries in the Middle East and Southeast Asia are introducing new regulations.

 12

The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record-keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.

International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Additionally, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China, for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.

Government Affairs

We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state Governors, legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers to improve patient care and to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general. The Government Affairs office also advocates for public policy that benefits our employees, and the patients we serve and supports the communities in which we live. 

Healthcare Policies and Reimbursement

Political, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders are significant and new therapies now take longer periods of time to gain widespread adoption.

The impact to our business of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms and delivery system has been immaterial. The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. In January 2018, another temporary two-year suspension of the 2.3 percent excise tax was passed, extending the suspension to December 31, 2019. On December 20, 2019, the President signed the 2020 spending bill, which included a provision to permanently repeal the excise tax.

The U.S. Federal government, as part of the ACA, and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or "sunshine," in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions have similar laws or are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could 

 13

have a negative impact on our results of operations. Additional legislation at the state and federal levels may result in further changes to these laws.

As noted below, we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing and utilization in the U.S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (TCJA), enacted December 22, 2017 in the U.S., changed the tax treatment of healthcare expenses and repealed the “individual mandate” to purchase private insurance. These tax law changes have resulted in changes to insurance coverage and financing of insurance coverage in individual markets. Additional legislation may result in changes to government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. In addition, the current U.S. Administration has enacted a number of administrative policy changes that will likely result in additional changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage and benefits offered through private insurance in both the employer-sponsored and individual markets. These changes and other similar changes being considered are likely to lead to an increase in the number of people without insurance. Other individual coverage policies will be less generous than those required under the ACA. The impact of these changes on coverage levels and patient cost-sharing could affect utilization of non-urgent, non-acute services in which our devices are used.

We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform, such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations (ACOs), continue to take shape globally. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients. 

Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients. Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures.

Proprietary Rights and Patent Litigation

We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2019, we held more than 21,000 patents and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.

We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. 

We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2019 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved.

Employees

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 36,000 employees, including approximately 14,000 in operations, 11,000 in selling, marketing and distribution, 7,000 in administration and 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development. Of these employees, we employed approximately 19,000 outside the U.S., approximately 9,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function.

Community Outreach

We are united by a goal to make a difference in the lives of the over 30 million patients we serve annually. We seek to give our time and resources to make positive impacts upon those communities where we live, work, and serve. Guided by our core values, we seek to improve access to healthcare, to invest in educational programming for students with limited means and access to opportunities, and to support and embrace the spirit of volunteerism within our global workforce, while adhering to strong ethical standards. 

In some parts of the world, access to health information, screening, care and services can be limited. Our collaborations with non-profit community organizations raise awareness of chronic disease and decrease these health disparities by improving health outcomes for underserved populations. We accomplish this through our focus on 3 P’s - Prevent, Provide and Prepare. We work to prevent chronic disease through education and awareness, provide access to healthcare through increasing the quantity and quality of healthcare workers and screenings, and preparing and empowering children at high risk of chronic disease to successfully navigate their health journey. Each year, our employees play a role in how we reach our health goals by participating in health awareness campaigns like Wear Red Day for heart health, No Shave November for men’s health, and in walks and runs for various health causes. For the last three years, Boston Scientific partnered with Project HOPE, a global health and humanitarian relief organization, to fund the United Dialogue and Action Against Non-Communicable Disorders (UDAAN) program to help reduce premature mortality in India. The program focuses on improving the health practices related to chronic disease treatment and care. Through the program, a chronic disease tool kit was developed to improve healthcare worker efficiencies and is now being scaled to other Health and Wellness centers in the area.

We are also passionate about inspiring young learners to see themselves in a Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) role in the future. Our employees work with underrepresented K-12 students around the world and share their passion for STEM by providing interactive product demos, development programs, and hands-on activities for young learners in their communities. A key effort of our STEM volunteers is to create resources that empower other employees to get involved. While each regional team focuses on what is needed most by students in their local communities, they also work together to share best practices that ensure we reach our overall goals. Resources like presentations, STEM kits, interactive displays, and an online activity database have been created to increase global collaboration and overall impact. In 2019, our employee volunteers participated in more than 160 STEM events and school programs. Through this outreach, we are helping to develop the diverse future talent that will enable Boston Scientific to create innovative health solutions for generations to come. Beyond the classroom, we empower our employees to participate in and influence the way we care for people in their local communities. We are proud of these efforts and the collective impact we have on advancing possibilities across the globe. In 2019 our employees volunteered more than 41,000 hours to make a positive impact at more than 600 global community events in 38 countries. 

We also support the U.S. communities where we have significant business presences through the Boston Scientific Foundation. The mission of the foundation is simple: to help expand access to quality healthcare and educational opportunities for underserved populations. The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded approximately $1 million dollars in scholarships to children of employees and grant awards across the U.S. in 2019. The process involved more than 70 employee volunteers who evaluated proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval, upon which the Boston Scientific Foundation was able to help fuel grassroots innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve.

Seasonality

Our net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While our consolidated net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases of our medical devices have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.
