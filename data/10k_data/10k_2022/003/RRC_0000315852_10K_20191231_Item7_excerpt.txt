ITEM 7.   

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition and should be read in conjunction with the information under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data and other financial information found elsewhere in this Form 10-K. See also matters referenced in the foregoing pages under “Disclosures Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”  

The following tables and discussions set forth key operating and financial data for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. For similar discussions of the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 results, refer to Item 7. “Managements’ Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under Part II of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018 which was filed with the SEC on February 25, 2019. 

Overview of Our Business  

We are an independent natural gas, natural gas liquids (“NGLs,”) crude oil and condensate company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and crude oil properties located primarily in the Appalachian and North Louisiana regions of the United States. We operate in one segment and have a single company-wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statements information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area-by-area basis.  

Our overarching business objective is to build stockholder value through returns focused development, measured on a per share debt adjusted basis. Our strategy to achieve our business objective is to generate consistent cash flow from reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects occasionally coupled with complementary acquisitions and divestitures of non-core or, at times, core assets. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate and on our ability to economically find, develop, acquire and produce natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves.  

Commodity prices have been and are expected to remain volatile. We believe we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in such a volatile pricing environment by: 

•  

exercising discipline in our capital program as we target funding our capital spending within operating cash flows and, if required, with borrowing under our bank credit facility; 

•  

continuing to optimize drilling, completion and operational efficiencies; 

•  

continuing to manage price risk by hedging our production; and  

•  

continuing to manage our balance sheet. 

Prices for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate fluctuate widely and affect: 

•  

our revenues, profitability and cash flow; 

•  

the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we can economically produce;  

•  

the quantity of natural gas, NGLs and oil shown as proved reserves; 

•  

the amount of cash flow available to us for capital expenditures; and 

•  

our ability to borrow and raise additional capital. 

We prepare our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets, liabilities and proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our natural gas, NGLs and oil activities. Our corporate headquarters is located in Fort Worth, Texas.  

Potential for Future Impairments 

We have in the past, and may incur in the future, impairments of proved and unproved property. As discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-K, we recorded both proved and unproved impairments of our North Louisiana properties at December 31, 2019. Through acquisition accounting, acquired asset values are recorded at their estimated fair market value at the time of closing. In 2016, when we acquired our North Louisiana properties, commodity prices were significantly higher when compared to the current environment. Our impairment assessment as of December 31, 2019 indicated the carrying amounts of our Marcellus properties were not impaired and that estimated undiscounted cash flows significantly exceeded their carrying value.

Sources of Our Revenues  

We derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate that is produced from our properties. Revenues from product sales are a function of the volumes produced, prevailing market prices, product quality, gas Btu content and transportation costs. Our revenues are generally recognized when control of the product is transferred to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured. Cash settlements of derivative contracts are included in derivative fair value in the accompanying statements of operations. Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenues include revenue we receive as a result of selling natural gas that is not our production (brokered), revenue from the release of transportation capacity where we have taken capacity ahead of our production and marketing fees we receive from third parties. 

Principal Components of Our Cost Structure  

•  

Direct operating. These are day-to-day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground along with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs include compensation of our field employees, maintenance, repairs and workover expenses related to our natural gas and oil properties. The majority of these costs are expected to remain a function of supply and demand. Direct operating expenses also include stock-based compensation expense (non-cash) associated with the amortization of equity grants as part of the compensation of our field employees.   

•  

Transportation, gathering, processing and compression. Under some of our sales arrangements, we sell natural gas and NGLs at a specific delivery point, pay transportation, gathering, processing and compression costs to a third party and receive proceeds from the purchaser with no deduction. Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense represents costs paid by Range to third parties under these arrangements.   

•  

Production and ad valorem taxes. Production taxes are paid on produced natural gas and oil based on a percentage of sales revenue (excluding derivatives) or at fixed rates established by the applicable federal, state or local taxing authorities. In Louisiana, ad valorem tax assessments are based on capital costs, well age, depth and production. The Pennsylvania impact fee on unconventional natural gas and oil production, which includes the Marcellus Shale, is also included in this category.   

•  

Brokered natural gas and marketing. These expenses are gas purchases for brokered natural gas that is not part of our production that we buy and sell plus the overhead, including payroll and benefits for our marketing staff. These expenses also include costs related to transportation capacity we have taken ahead of our production. Brokered natural gas and marketing expenses also include stock-based compensation expense (non-cash) associated with the amortization of equity grants as part of our marketing staff compensation.   

•  

Exploration. These costs are geological and geophysical costs, such as payroll and benefits for the geological and geophysical staff, seismic costs, delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory dry holes. Exploration expenses also include stock-based compensation expense (non-cash) associated with the amortization of equity grants as part of the compensation of our exploration staff.   

•  

Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties. This category includes unproved property impairment expense associated with oil and gas lease expirations, shifts in business strategy which may impact our number of drilling locations or changing economic factors. Impairment on a majority of our unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success.  

•  

General and administrative. These costs include overhead, such as payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, franchise taxes, audit and other professional fees, legal compliance and legal settlements. Included in this category are overhead expense reimbursements we receive from working interest owners of properties, for which we serve as the operator. These reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property’s life. General and administrative expenses also include stock-based compensation expense (non-cash) associated with the amortization of equity grants as part of the compensation of our corporate staff and our non-employee directors.   

•  

Deferred compensation plan. These costs relate to the increase or decrease in the value of the liability associated with our deferred compensation plan. Our deferred compensation plan gives directors, officers and key employees the ability to defer all or a portion of their salaries and bonuses and invest in our common stock or make other investments at the individual’s discretion. The assets of this plan are held in a grantor trust, are funded on the grant date and are available to satisfy the claims of our creditors in the event of bankruptcy or insolvency. We do not maintain a defined benefit retirement plan for any of our employees. However, in fourth quarter 2017, we implemented a succession plan enhancement for officers which includes a post-retirement benefit plan to assist in providing health care to officers who are active employees and have met certain age and service requirements. These benefits are provided up to age 65 or on the date they become eligible for Medicare.  

49 

•  

Interest. We have typically financed a portion of our cash requirements with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with longer-term debt securities. Also included in our interest expense are administrative fees associated with our bank credit facility and the amortization of deferred financing costs. As a result, we incur interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We currently have no capitalized interest.   

•  

Depreciation, depletion and amortization. This category of expenses includes the systematic expensing of the capitalized costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas, NGLs and oil. As a successful efforts company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts, and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This expense also includes the systematic, monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as wells, service assets, pipelines and other facilities.   

•  

Income tax. We are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a cash taxpaying position for federal income taxes, primarily due to the current deductibility and/or accelerated amortization of intangible drilling costs (“IDC”). At this time, we generally do not pay significant state income taxes due to our state net operating loss carryovers and our ability to follow the federal treatment of deducting IDC in most of the states in which we operate. Currently, all of our federal taxes are deferred. As of December 31, 2019, we have federal valuation allowances of $32.5 million and state valuation allowances of $158.3 million. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors-Certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated or postponed and additional federal or state taxes on natural gas extraction may be imposed, as a result of future legislation.  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations  

Commodity prices have remained volatile. Natural gas, oil and NGLs benchmarks decreased in 2019 compared to 2018. As a result, we experienced significant decreases in our price realizations. While operating in this lower commodity price environment, we had many operational, financial and strategic successes in 2019. During 2019, we continued our focus on enhancing margins and returns, driving operational efficiencies, simplifying our portfolio and maintaining liquidity. We believe we have positioned ourselves for long-term success through the natural gas and oil business cycle. In summary, we exited 2019 with operational momentum, investment flexibility and a robust financial liquidity position, which we expect to carry over to 2020. 

Overview of 2019 Results  

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we experienced a decrease in revenue from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil due to 25% decrease in net realized prices (average prices including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs paid by us) partially offset by 4% higher production volumes when compared to 2018. Daily production in 2019 averaged 2.3 Bcfe compared to 2.2 Bcfe in 2018 as a result of drilling and completions in Pennsylvania. Average natural gas differentials were below NYMEX while operating costs were lower when compared to 2018. 

During 2019, we recognized net loss of $1.7 billion, or $6.92 per diluted common share compared to net loss of $1.7 billion, or $7.10 per diluted common share during 2018. The year ended 2019 includes a $1.1 billion impairment of proved property compared to a $1.6 billion goodwill impairment in the prior year, significantly higher abandonment and impairment of unproved property and lower realized prices.  

During 2019, we achieved the following financial and operating performance results:  

•  

received $784.9 million of proceeds, primarily from the sale, in three separate transactions, of a proportionately reduced 2.5% overriding royalty primarily in our Washington County, Pennsylvania properties where we received proceeds of $750.0 million;   

•  

repurchased $201.6 million face value of our senior notes at a discount and recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt;  

•  

achieved 4% production growth from 2018;  

•  

achieved 1% annual proved reserve growth, despite our royalty sales, with a 40% decrease in the standardized after-tax measure of discounted future net cash flows when compared to 2018 primarily due to lower prices;  

•  

capital spending was 4% lower than original 2019 budget;  

•  

drilled 92.6 net wells with a 100% success rate;   

•  

continued expansion of our activities in the Marcellus Shale by growing production, proving up acreage and acquiring additional unproved acreage;   

•  

reduced general and administrative expenses per mcfe 15% from 2018;  

•  

reduced interest expense per mcfe 12% from 2018;  

50 

•  

reduced our DD&A rate per mcfe 16% from 2018;   

•  

reduced total debt by $667.6 million;  

•  

achieved a debt per mcfe of proved reserves of $0.18 compared to $0.21 in 2018;  

•  

entered into additional commodity-based derivative contracts for 2020 and 2021;   

•  

realized $681.8 million of cash flow from operating activities; and  

•  

ended the year with stockholders’ equity of $2.3 billion.   

In 2019, operationally we continued to focus on flexibility, efficiencies and controlling costs. As evidenced by history and our current industry environment, the prices at which we sell our production are volatile and we have little control over them. Therefore, to improve our profitability, we focus our efforts on improving operating efficiency. We continue to focus on material reductions in unit costs. As reservoirs are depleted and production rates decline, per unit production costs will generally increase. To lessen this effect, we concentrate our production in core areas with low base decline rates where we can achieve economies of scale to help manage our operating costs. 

We generated $681.8 million of cash flow from operating activities in 2019, a decrease of $308.8 million from 2018 which reflects significantly lower realized prices partially offset by higher production volumes and lower comparative working capital outflows ($2.5 million inflow during 2019 compared to $8.2 million outflow in 2018). We ended 2019 with $1.7 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, with an additional $600.0 million in borrowing base capacity available. 

Acquisitions  

During 2019, we spent $57.3 million to acquire unproved acreage compared to $62.4 million in 2018. We continue selective acreage leasing and lease renewals to consolidate our acreage positions in the Marcellus Shale play in Pennsylvania. 

Divestitures  

Pennsylvania. In third quarter 2019, we sold, in three separate transactions, a proportionately reduced 2.5% overriding royalty primarily in our Washington County, Pennsylvania leases for gross proceeds of $750.0 million and we recorded a loss of $36.5 million which represents closing adjustments and transaction fees. In second quarter 2019, we sold natural gas and oil property, primarily representing over 20,000 unproved acres, for proceeds of $34.0 million and recognized a gain of $5.9 million. In fourth quarter 2018, we sold a proportionately reduced 1% overriding royalty in our Washington County, Pennsylvania leases for gross proceeds of $300.0 million and we recorded a loss of $10.2 million which represents closing adjustments and transaction fees.  

Oklahoma. In 2018, we sold various properties in Northern Oklahoma for proceeds of $23.3 million and we recognized a net loss of $39,000, after closing adjustments.  

2020 Outlook  

As we enter 2020, we believe we are positioned for sustainable long-term success. For 2020, our board of directors approved a $520.0 million capital budget for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate related activities, excluding proved property acquisitions, for which we do not budget. Our 2020 capital budget is 98% allocated to our Appalachian division. As has been our historical practice, we will periodically review our capital expenditures throughout the year and may adjust the budget based on commodity prices, drilling success and other factors. We expect our 2020 capital budget to achieve production similar to our 2019 production, as we target limiting our capital spending to at or below cash flow and, if required, with borrowings under our bank credit facility. Our 2020 capital budget is designed to focus on continuing to improve corporate returns and generating free cash flow. To the extent commodity prices decline, we may reduce the capital budget with the intent of limiting capital spending to at or below cash flow. The prices we receive for our natural gas, NGLs and oil production are largely based on current market prices, which are beyond our control. The price risk on a portion of our forecasted natural gas, NGLs and oil production for 2020 is mitigated by entering into commodity derivative contracts and we intend to continue to enter into these types of contracts. We believe it is likely that commodity prices will continue to be volatile during 2020. 

Market Conditions  

Prices for various quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil that we produce significantly impact our revenues and cash flows. Prices for commodities, such as hydrocarbons, are inherently volatile. Significant commodity price declines decreased our average realized prices. Recently, natural gas prices have decreased, when compared to December 2019, with the average NYMEX monthly settlement price for natural gas decreasing to $1.88 per mcf for February 2020. Crude oil prices have also decreased, when compared to December 2019, to $57.53 per barrel in January 2020. The following table lists related benchmarks for natural gas, oil and NGLs composite prices for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.  

51 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a) Based on average of bid week prompt month prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”). 

(b) Based on our estimated NGLs product composition per barrel.  

Our price realizations (not including the impact of our derivatives) may differ from the benchmarks for many reasons, including quality, location, or production being sold at different indices. 

Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Sales, Production and Realized Price Calculations  

Our revenues vary from year to year as a result of changes in realized commodity prices and production volumes. For more information, see “Sources of Our Revenues” above. In 2019, natural gas NGLs and oil sales decreased 21% from 2018 with a 4% increase in production and a 24% decrease in realized prices (excluding cash settlements on our derivatives). The following table illustrates the primary components of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate sales for the last two years (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our production continues to grow through drilling success as we place new wells on production which is partially offset by the natural decline of our natural gas and oil reserves through production and asset sales. For 2019, our production increased 10% in our Appalachian region when compared to 2018. Production from our North Louisiana properties was 76.5 Bcfe in 2019 compared to 110.6 Bcfe in 2018. Our production for the last two years is set forth in the following table:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Represents volumes sold regardless of when produced.   

(b)   

Oil and NGLs volumes are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil and natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.   

52 

Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs paid by Range) received during 2019 was $1.49 per mcfe compared to $1.99 per mcfe in 2018. Because we record transportation costs on two separate bases, as required by U.S. GAAP, we believe computed final realized prices should include the impact of transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do not include any derivative settlements or third-party transportation costs which are reported in transportation, gathering and compression expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Average sales prices (excluding derivative settlements) do include transportation costs where we receive net proceeds from the purchaser. Our average realized price (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs paid by Range) calculation includes all cash settlements for derivatives. Average realized price calculations for the last two years are shown below:

(a)  

Oil and NGLs volumes are converted at the rate of one barrel equals six mcf based upon the approximate relative energy content of oil to natural gas, which is not indicative of the relationship between oil and natural gas prices.  

Realized prices include the impact of basis differentials and gains or losses realized from our basis hedging. The prices we receive for our natural gas can be more or less than the NYMEX price because of adjustments for delivery location, relative quality and other factors. The following table provides this impact on a per mcf basis: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following tables reflect our production and average realized commodity prices (excluding derivative settlements and third-party transportation costs paid by Range) (in thousands, except prices):

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense was $1.2 billion in 2019 compared to $1.1 billion in 2018. These third-party costs are higher due to our production growth in the Marcellus Shale where we have third-party gathering, compression, processing and transportation agreements. Additionally, we experienced higher costs resulting from new in-service pipelines, higher NGLs costs due to higher production and higher NGLs expense in North Louisiana due to fully utilizing amounts that were previously accrued for as capacity commitments. We have included these costs in the calculation of average realized prices (including all derivative settlements and third-party transportation expenses paid by Range). The following table summarizes transportation, gathering, processing and compression expense for the last two years (in thousands) and on a per mcf and per barrel basis: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Derivative fair value income (loss) was income of $226.7 million in 2019 compared to loss of $51.2 million in 2018. All of our derivatives are accounted for using the mark-to-market accounting method. Mark-to-market accounting treatment creates volatility in our revenues as unrealized gains and losses from derivatives are included in total revenues. As commodity prices increase or decrease, such changes will have an opposite effect on the mark-to-market value of our derivatives. Gains on our derivatives generally indicate lower wellhead revenues in the future while losses indicate higher future wellhead revenues. At December 31, 2019, our commodity derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value, which was a net derivative asset of $126.7 million, an increase of $45.8 million from the $80.9 million net derivative asset recorded as of December 31, 2018. We have also entered into basis swap agreements to limit volatility caused by changing differentials between NYMEX and regional prices received. These basis swaps are marked to market and we recognized a net derivative asset of $9.4 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to a net derivative asset of $4.8 million as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we have propane basis swaps to limit the volatility caused by changing differentials between Mont Belvieu and international propane indexes which are recognized as a net derivative liability of $14.1 million as of December 31, 2019 compared to a net derivative asset of $117,000 as of December 31, 2018. In connection with our international propane swaps, we also have freight swap contracts which lock in the freight rate for a specific trade route on the Baltic Exchange which are recognized as a net derivative asset of $1.5 million compared to a net derivative liability of $561,000 as of December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the impact of our commodity derivatives for the last two years (in thousands): 

54 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a non-GAAP measure. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives only represent the net change between periods of the fair market values of commodity derivative positions and exclude the impact of settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. We believe that non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is a useful supplemental disclosure to differentiate non-cash fair market value adjustments from settlements on commodity derivatives during the period. Non-cash fair value adjustments on commodity derivatives is not a measure of financial or operating performance under GAAP, nor should it be considered a substitute for derivative fair value income or loss as reported in our consolidated statements of operations. 

Brokered natural gas, marketing and other revenue was $345.5 million in 2019 compared to $482.8 million in 2018. We enter into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties at different times to satisfy unused pipeline capacity commitments. The 2019 period includes $332.0 million of revenue from the sale of natural gas that is not related to our production (brokered) and $1.7 million of revenue from the sale of NGLs that is not related to our production. These revenues both decreased compared to 2018 due to lower brokered volumes and lower sales prices. Fourth quarter 2018 also included a production volume shortfall due to third-party processing facility plant repairs with additional volumes being purchased and sold to satisfy our commitments.  

Costs and Expenses per mcfe 

We believe some of our expense fluctuations are best analyzed on a unit-of-production, or per mcfe, basis. The following presents information about certain of our expenses on a per mcfe basis for the last two years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Direct operating expense was $136.3 million in 2019 compared to $139.5 million in 2018. Direct operating expenses include normally recurring expenses to operate and produce our wells, non-recurring workovers and repair-related expenses. On an absolute basis, our direct operating expenses for 2019 decreased 2% from the prior year primarily due to lower water hauling/handling costs, utilities, equipment rentals and pumper costs and the impact from the sale of our Northern Oklahoma properties in the prior year partially offset by higher workover costs. We incurred $24.3 million of workover costs in 2019 compared to $9.8 million of workover costs in 2018.  

55 

On a per mcfe basis, operating expense for 2019 decreased $0.01, or 6% from the same period of 2018, with the decrease due to the impact from the sale of certain non-core assets in 2018 and lower water hauling/handling costs partially offset by higher workover costs. We have experienced lower costs per mcfe as we have increased production from our Marcellus Shale wells due to their lower operating cost relative to our other operating areas. Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of equity grants as part of the compensation of field employees. The following table summarizes direct operating expenses per mcfe for the last two years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices, not hedged prices. This expense category also includes the Pennsylvania impact fee. In February 2012, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania enacted an “impact fee” on unconventional natural gas and oil production which includes the Marcellus Shale. The impact fee is based upon the year wells are drilled and the fee varies, like a severance tax, based upon natural gas prices. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes a $25.9 million impact fee compared to $32.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 with the decline primarily due to lower natural gas prices. Production and ad valorem taxes (excluding the impact fee) were $12.0 million in 2019 compared to $13.7 million in 2018 with the decline also due to lower natural gas prices. The following table summarizes production and ad valorem taxes per mcfe for the last two years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

General and administrative expense was $181.1 million for 2019 compared to $209.8 million for 2018. The decrease in 2019, when compared to 2018, is primarily due to lower stock-based compensation of $8.7 million, lower legal costs (including settlements) of $14.4 million, lower salaries and benefits of $8.0 million and lower technology costs which were partially offset by higher bad debt expenses of $5.3 million and higher franchise taxes.  

On a per mcfe basis, general and administrative expense for 2019 decreased 15% from the same period of 2018, with the decrease due to lower salaries and benefits and lower legal costs (including settlements). Stock-based compensation expense represents the amortization of stock-based compensation awards granted to our employees and our non-employee directors as part of their compensation. The following table summarizes general and administrative expenses per mcfe for the last two years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

56 

Interest expense was $194.3 million for 2019 compared to $210.2 million for 2018. The following table presents information about interest expense per mcfe for the last two years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Includes commitment fees but excludes amortization of debt issue costs and amortization of discount.  

On an absolute basis, the decrease in interest expense for 2019 from the same period of 2018 was primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances partially offset by slightly higher average interest rates. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility for 2019 was $772.1 million compared to $1.3 billion for 2018 and the weighted average interest rate on the bank credit facility was 3.8% for 2019 compared to 3.7% in 2018.  

Depletion, depreciation and amortization (“DD&A”) was $548.8 million in 2019 compared to $635.5 million in 2018. The decrease in 2019 when compared to 2018 is due to a 16% decrease in depletion rates partially offset by a 4% increase in production volumes.  

On a per mcfe basis, DD&A decreased to $0.66 in 2019 compared to $0.79 in 2018. Depletion expense, the largest component of DD&A, was $0.63 per mcfe in 2019 compared to $0.75 per mcfe in 2018. We have historically adjusted our depletion rates in the fourth quarter of each year based on our year-end reserve report and at other times during the year when circumstances indicate there has been a significant change in reserves or costs. We currently expect our DD&A rate to be approximately $0.50 per mcfe in 2020, based on our current production estimates. In areas where we are actively drilling, such as the Marcellus Shale area, our fourth quarter adjusted 2019 depletion rates were lower than the fourth quarter 2018 and 2017 depletion rates. Depletion rates in new plays tend to be higher in the beginning as increased initial outlays are amortized over proved reserves based on early stages of evaluations. The decrease in DD&A per mcfe in 2019 when compared to 2018 is due to the mix of our production from our properties with lower depletion rates. The following table summarizes DD&A expenses per mcfe for the last two years:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Other Operating Expenses  

Our total operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock-based compensation, brokered natural gas and marketing, exploration expense, abandonment and impairment of unproved properties, termination costs, deferred compensation plan expenses, gain on early extinguishment of debt, impairment of proved properties and impairment of goodwill.  

The following table details stock-based compensation that is allocated to functional expense categories for the last two years (in thousands):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

57 

Stock-based compensation includes the amortization of restricted stock and PSUs grants.  

Brokered natural gas and marketing expense was $359.9 million in 2019 compared to $496.0 million in 2018. We enter into purchase transactions with third parties and separate sale transactions with third parties at different times to satisfy unused capacity commitments. The decrease in these costs reflects lower broker purchase volumes and lower purchase prices. Fourth quarter 2018 also included a production shortfall due to a third-party processing facility plant repairs with additional volumes being purchased and sold to satisfy our commitments. The following table details our brokered natural gas, marketing and other net margin which includes the net effect of these third-party transactions for the two-year period ended December 31, 2019 (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Exploration expense was $36.7 million in 2019 compared to $34.1 million in 2018. Exploration expense in 2019 was higher compared to the prior year due to higher delay rentals and other costs somewhat offset by lower personnel costs. Stock-based compensation represents the amortization of equity stock grants as part of the compensation of our exploration staff. The following table details our exploration related expenses for the last two years (in thousands):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Abandonment and impairment of unproved properties was $1.2 billion in 2019 compared to $515.0 million in 2018. Impairment of individually insignificant unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. We assess individually significant unproved properties for impairment on a quarterly basis and recognize a loss where circumstances indicate impairment in value. In determining whether a significant unproved property is impaired we consider numerous factors including, but not limited to, current exploration plans, favorable or unfavorable activity on the property being evaluated and/or adjacent properties, our geologists’ evaluation of the property and the remaining months in the lease term for the property. In certain circumstances, our future plans to develop acreage may accelerate our impairment. In 2019, an impairment of $1.2 billion was recorded in relation to North Louisiana unproved property value allocated to previously acquired probable and possible reserves that we no longer have the intent to drill based on a shift in capital allocation which materially impacted our drilling inventory compared to a similar impairment in North Louisiana of $436.0 million in 2018. As we continue to review our acreage positions and high grade our drilling inventory based on the price environment or for other operational changes, additional leasehold impairments and abandonments may be recorded.  

Termination costs in 2019 include $7.5 million of estimated severance costs and $2.0 million of accelerated vesting of equity grants compared to favorable severance accrual adjustments of $373,000 in 2018. In 2019, we continued to implement work force reductions in response to the lower commodity price environment including the closing of our Houston office. 

Deferred compensation plan expense was a gain of $15.5 million in 2019 compared to $18.6 million in 2018. Our stock price decreased to $4.85 at December 31, 2019 from $9.57 at December 31, 2018. This non-cash item relates to the increase or decrease in value of the liability associated with our common stock that is vested and held in our deferred compensation plan. The deferred compensation liability is adjusted to fair value by a charge or a credit to deferred compensation plan expense. Common shares are placed in the deferred compensation plan when granted. 

Gain on early extinguishment of debt was $5.4 million in 2019. We repurchased $201.6 million face value of our 5.75% senior notes due 2021, our 5.875% senior notes due 2022 and our 5.00% senior notes due 2022. We repurchased these notes at a discount and recorded a gain on early extinguishment after transaction costs and expensing the remaining deferred financing costs.  

58 

Impairment of proved properties increased to $1.1 billion in 2019 compared to $22.6 million in 2018. We assess our long-lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Fair value is generally determined using an income approach based on internal estimates of future production levels, prices, drilling and operating costs and discount rates. In some cases, we may also use a market approach, based on either anticipated sales proceeds less costs to sell or a market comparable sales price. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for details. The year ended 2019 included an impairment related to our North Louisiana assets due to a shift in business strategy employed by management and the possibility of a divestiture of these assets. As a result of our impairment assessments, we recorded non-cash impairment charges to reduce the carrying values of oil and gas properties as follows: 

▪  

2019: North Louisiana assets ($1.1 billion) 

▪  

2018: Northwest Pennsylvania shallow legacy assets ($15.3 million) 

▪  

2018: Oklahoma assets ($7.3 million) 

Impairment of goodwill was $1.6 billion in 2018. During fourth quarter 2018, due to the significant decline in our stock price, we performed a quantitative impairment assessment of our goodwill. Fair value was estimated based on a combination of a market and an income approach. Goodwill is related to the excess purchase price over amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business acquisition. Our estimate of fair value required us to use significant unobservable inputs including assumptions for commodity prices, production, forward pricing curves, operating and development costs and other factors. Based on this analysis, we determined the fair value of goodwill was zero and goodwill was fully impaired. 

Income tax benefit was $500.3 million in 2019 compared to $30.5 million in 2018. The 2019 increase reflects a $439.6 million additional loss before income taxes when compared to 2018. The year ended December 31, 2018 included a goodwill impairment of $1.6 billion that was not benefited for tax. The effective tax rate was 22.6% in 2019 compared to 1.7% in 2018. The 2019 and 2018 effective tax rates were different than the statutory tax rate due to state income taxes and other discrete tax items which are detailed below. For each of the two years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, current income tax expense relates to state income taxes. The following table summarizes our tax activity for the last two years (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

We estimate our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets by analyzing the reversal patterns of our temporary differences, our loss carryforward periods and the Pennsylvania and Louisiana net operating loss carryforward limitations. Uncertainties such as future commodity prices can affect our calculations and the expiration of loss carryforwards prior to utilization can result in recording a partial as opposed to a full valuation allowance.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows, Capital Resources and Liquidity  

Cash Flows  

The following table presents sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the last two years (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash flows from operating activities are primarily affected by production volumes and commodity prices, net of the effects of settlements of our derivatives. Our cash flows from operating activities are also impacted by changes in working capital. We generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce our bank debt. Short-term liquidity needs are satisfied by borrowings under our bank credit facility. Because of this, and because our principal source of operating cash flows (proved reserves to be produced in the following year) cannot be reported as working capital, we often have low or negative working capital. We sell a portion of our production at the wellhead under floating market contracts. From time to time, we enter into various derivative contracts to provide an economic hedge of our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future natural gas, NGLs and oil production. The production we hedge has and will continue to vary from year to year depending on, among other things, our expectation of future commodity prices. Since year-end 2019, we have entered into additional natural gas and NGLs hedges for 2020 and 2021. Any payments due to counterparties under our derivative contracts should ultimately be funded by prices received from the sale of our production. However, production receipts often lag payments to the counterparties. Any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under the bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, we have entered into derivative agreements covering 387.2 Bcfe for 2020 and 20.4 Bcfe for 2021, not including our basis swaps. 

Net cash provided from operating activities in 2019 was $681.8 million compared to $990.7 million in 2018. The decrease in cash provided from operating activities is the result of a 25% decrease in realized prices partially offset by a 4% increase in production volumes. Net cash provided from operating activities is also affected by working capital changes or the timing of cash receipts and disbursements. Changes in working capital (as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows) for 2019 was an inflow of $2.5 million compared to an outflow of $8.2 million for 2018.  

Disposal of assets in 2019 included proceeds of $750.0 million from the sale, in three separate transactions, of a proportionately reduced 2.5% overriding royalty in our Washington County, Pennsylvania leases and $34.0 million of proceeds from the sale of unproved property in Pennsylvania. In 2018, we received proceeds of $300.0 million from the sale of a proportionately reduced 1% overriding royalty in our Washington County, Pennsylvania leases and $23.3 million of proceeds from the sale of certain properties in Northern Oklahoma.  

60 

Additions to natural gas and oil properties are our most significant use of cash and cash equivalents. These cash outlays are associated with our drilling and completion capital budget program. The following table shows capital expenditures by region and reconciles to additions to natural gas and oil properties as presented on our consolidated statements of cash flows for the last two years (in thousands): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Repayment of senior notes for 2019 includes open market purchases of $101.8 million principal amount of our 5.75% senior notes due 2021, $68.1 million principal amount of our 5.00% senior notes due 2022 and $31.6 million principal amount of our 5.875% senior notes due 2022. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our main sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flow from operating activities, a bank credit facility with uncommitted and committed availability, asset sales and access to the debt and equity capital markets. In April 2018, we entered into an amended and restated bank credit facility with a maturity date of April 13, 2023. We must find new and develop existing reserves to maintain and grow our production and cash flows. We accomplish this primarily through successful drilling programs which require substantial capital expenditures. Lower prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil may reduce the amount of natural gas, NGLs and oil we can economically produce and can also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow or raise additional capital. 

We currently believe that net cash generated from operating activities, unused committed borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales combined with our natural gas, NGLs and oil derivatives currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near-term financial obligations and liquidity needs. While our expectation is to operate within our internally generated cash flow, to the extent our capital requirements exceed our internally generated cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, we will use borrowings under our credit facility or debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the natural gas and oil business. We establish a capital budget at the beginning of each calendar year and review it during the course of the year. Our 2020 capital budget is $520.0 million. Actual capital expenditure levels may vary due to many factors, including drilling results, natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services and the extent to which properties are acquired or assets are sold. 

Commodity prices have remained volatile. We have adjusted and must continue to adjust our business through efficiencies and cost reductions to compete in the current price environment which also requires reductions in overall debt levels over time. We plan to continue to work towards profitable growth within our cash flows. We would expect to monitor the market and look for opportunities to refinance or reduce debt based on market conditions. We believe we are well-positioned to manage the challenges presented in a low commodity price environment and that we can endure continued volatility in current and future commodity prices by: 

•  

exercising discipline in our capital program with our goal to target funding our capital spending within operating cash flows and, if required, with borrowings under our bank credit facility;  

•  

continuing to optimize our drilling, completion and operational efficiencies;  

•  

continuing to manage price risk by hedging our production volumes; and  

•  

continuing to manage our balance sheet.  

We believe that we will have adequate capital resources and liquidity for the foreseeable future because (1) we have significant borrowing capacity under our bank credit facility with a maturity in 2023 (2) we have commodity derivatives in place which cover a portion of our 2020 and 2021 production (3) we can reduce our capital expenditures for extended periods of time if necessary and (4) as of December 31, 2019, the maturity of our senior and senior subordinated notes extend one year or more and such notes carry attractive fixed interest rates ranging from 4.875% to 5.875%. In January 2020, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2026 for an estimated net proceeds of $541.6 million. On the closing of the 9.25% senior notes, we used the proceeds to redeem $324.1 million of our 5.75% senior notes due 2021 and $175.9 million of our 5.875% senior notes due 2022, which was completed in February 2020. For additional information, see Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. 

From time to time, we may seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other debt or equity securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if  

61 

any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts may be material. 

Credit Arrangements  

Long-term debt at December 31, 2019 totaled $3.2 billion, including $477.0 million of bank credit facility debt, $2.7 billion of senior notes and $49.0 million of senior subordinated notes. As of December 31, 2019, we maintain a bank credit facility with a borrowing base of $3.0 billion and aggregate lender commitments of $2.4 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we also have $250.2 million of undrawn letters of credit. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and has a maturity date of April 13, 2023. Availability under the bank credit facility, during a non-investment grade period, is subject to a borrowing base set by the lenders annually (at their discretion) with an option to reset the borrowing base more often in certain circumstances. Availability under the bank credit facility during an investment grade period is limited to the aggregate lender commitments. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors, but primarily the lenders’ assessments of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base to maintain or reduce the amount thereof require approval of two-thirds of the lenders and increases require 95% approval of the lenders.  

Our bank credit facility imposes limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments (as defined under the debt agreements for our bank debt). The debt agreements also contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, liens, investments and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2019.  

Proved Reserves  

To maintain and grow production and cash flow, we must continue to develop existing proved reserves and locate or acquire new natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. The following is a discussion of proved reserves, reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our proved reserves at year-end 2019 were 18.2 Tcfe compared to 18.1 Tcfe at year-end 2018. Natural gas comprised approximately 67% of our proved reserves at year-end 2019, 2018 and 2017. 

Reserve Additions and Revisions. During 2019, we added 1.2 Tcfe of proved reserves from drilling activities and evaluation of proved areas primarily in the Marcellus Shale. Approximately 83% of 2019 reserve additions was attributable to natural gas. Included in 2019 proved reserves is a total of 475.0 Mmbbls of ethane reserves (2,102 Bcfe) in the Marcellus Shale, which represents reserves that match volumes delivered under our existing long-term, extendable contracts. Revisions of previous estimates of 303.1 Bcfe includes positive performance revisions of 922.2 Bcfe somewhat offset by 601.3 Bcfe reserves reclassified to unproved due to drilling plans and negative pricing revisions of 17.8 Bcfe. 

During 2018, we added 3.1 Tcfe of proved reserves from drilling activities and evaluation of proved areas primarily in the Marcellus Shale. Approximately 72% of 2018 reserve additions was attributable to natural gas. Included in 2018 proved reserves is a total of 468.9 Mmbbls of ethane reserves (2,074 Bcfe) in the Marcellus Shale, which represents reserves that match volumes delivered under our existing long-term, extendable contracts. Revisions of previous estimates of 731.7 Bcfe include positive pricing revisions of 11.0 Bcfe, improved recovery for our Marcellus Shale properties of 154.0 Bcfe and positive performance revisions of 945.5 Bcfe somewhat offset by 378.8 Bcfe reserves reclassified to unproved due to drilling plans.  

Sales. In 2019, we sold 511.8 Bcfe of reserves in Pennsylvania. In 2018, we sold 143.6 Bcfe of reserves in Pennsylvania and 118.2 Bcfe of reserves in Oklahoma.  

62 

Future Net Cash Flows. At December 31, 2019, the present value (discounted at 10%) of estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves was $7.6 billion. The present value of our estimated future net cash flows at December 31, 2018 was $13.2 billion. This present value was calculated based on the unweighted average first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the prior twelve months held flat for the life of the reserves, in accordance with SEC rules. At December 31, 2019, the after-tax present value of estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves was $6.6 billion compared to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2018.  

The present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of our proved reserves. An estimate of fair value would also take into account, among other things, anticipated changes in future prices and costs, the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money to the evaluating party and the perceived risks inherent in producing oil and gas.  

Capitalization and Dividend Payments  

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our total debt and capitalization were as follows (in thousands):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and primarily depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors. In 2019, we paid $20.1 million in dividends to our stockholders ($0.02 per share per quarter) compared to $19.9 million in 2018 ($0.02 per share per quarter). In January 2020, we announced that the board has suspended the dividend. 

Cash Contractual Obligations  

Our contractual obligations include long-term debt, operating leases, derivative obligations, asset retirement obligations, and transportation, gathering and processing commitments. As of December 31, 2019, we do not have any capital leases or any significant off-balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed any debt of any unrelated party. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $250.2 million of letters of credit outstanding under our bank credit facility. The table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2019. In addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below, our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of $2.2 million, which is payable in first quarter 2020. We expect to make interest payments through the end of each note maturity, based upon the amounts outstanding at December 31, 2019, of $23.0 million per year on our 5.75% senior and senior subordinated notes, $64.0 million per year on our 5.0% senior and senior subordinated notes, $36.6 million per year on our 4.875% senior notes and $17.5 million on our 5.875% senior notes. 

63 

The following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2019 and their future maturities. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under our bank credit facility, additional debt issuances and proceeds from asset sales (in thousands).  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)   

Due at termination date of our bank credit facility. Interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately $14.3 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance.  

(b)  

Amounts included transportation and gathering commitments after 2024 will decline as follows: $764.0 million in 2025; $688.0 million in 2026; $618.0 million in 2027; $580.0 million in 2028; $500.0 million in 2029; declining to $167.0 million in 2033 until the final year of $7.0 million in 2039. 

(c)   

The ultimate settlement amount and timing cannot be precisely determined in advance. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  

(d)   

This table excludes the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets.  

In addition to the amounts included in the above table, we have entered into additional agreements which are contingent on certain pipeline modifications and/or construction for natural gas volumes of 25,000 mcf per day, which is expected to begin in 2022 and has a six-year term. 

Delivery Commitments  

We have various volume delivery commitments that are related to our Marcellus Shale and North Louisiana areas. We expect to be able to fulfill our contractual obligations from our own production; however, we may purchase third-party volumes to satisfy our commitments or pay demand fees for commitment shortfalls, should they occur. As of December 31, 2019, our delivery commitments through 2031 were as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition to the amounts included in the above table, we have contracted with a pipeline company through 2035 to deliver ethane production volumes from our Marcellus Shale wells. These agreements and related fees, which are contingent upon pipeline construction and/or modification, are for 3,000 bbls per day starting in 2021 and increasing to 10,000 bbls per day through 2035. In addition, we have agreements in place to deliver natural gas volumes from our Marcellus Shale wells, which are also contingent upon pipeline construction and/or modification, for 35,000 mcf per day starting late 2020, increasing to 50,000 mcf per day in 2021 and decreasing to 15,000 mcf per day in 2025. 

64 

Other  

We have various midstream service agreements in North Louisiana for gathering, processing and transporting of natural gas and NGLs. Pursuant to the gas processing agreement, we must pay a quarterly deficiency payment based on the firm-commitment fixed fee if the cumulative minimum volume commitment as of the end of a quarter exceeds the sum of (i) the cumulative volumes processed under the processing agreement as of the end of the quarter plus (ii) volumes corresponding to deficiency payments incurred prior to each quarter. In the event these properties are sold in the future and any or all of these charges are retained by us, we would recognize and accrue these future divestiture-related charges, which could be significant.  

We lease acreage that is generally subject to lease expiration if initial wells are not drilled within a specified period, generally between three and five years. We do not expect to lose significant lease acreage because of failure to drill due to inadequate capital, equipment or personnel. However, based on our evaluation of prospective economics, including the cost of infrastructure to connect production, we have allowed acreage to expire and will allow additional acreage to expire in the future. To date, our expenditures to comply with environmental or safety regulations have not been a significant component of our cost structure and are not expected to be significant in the future. However, new regulations, enforcement policies, claims for damages, or other events could result in significant future costs.  

Hedging – Natural Gas, Oil and NGLs Prices  

We use commodity-based derivative contracts to help manage exposures to commodity price fluctuations. We do not enter into these arrangements for speculative or trading purposes. We do not utilize complex derivatives as we typically utilize commodity swaps, swaptions and calls to (1) reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities we produce and sell and (2) support our annual capital budget and expenditure plans. In addition, we may utilize basis contracts to hedge the differential between NYMEX and those of our physical pricing points or between Mont Belvieu and international propane indexes. For more discussion of our derivative activities, see Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates – Natural Gas and Oil Derivatives below and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk and Other Commodity Risk. For more information regarding the accounting for our derivatives, see the discussion in Notes 2, 10 and 11 to our consolidated financial statements. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising natural gas, NGLs and oil prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long-term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital and better access to bank and other credit markets.  

Interest Rates  

At December 31, 2019, we had $3.2 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $2.7 billion bears interest at fixed rates averaging 5.2%. Bank debt totaling $477.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 3.0% at year-end 2019. The 30-day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2019 was 1.8%. A 1% increase in short-term interest rates on the floating-rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019 would cost us approximately $4.8 million in additional annual interest expense.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We do not currently utilize any off-balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities to enhance our liquidity or capital resources position. However, as is customary in the natural gas and oil industry, we have various contractual work commitments which are described above under cash contractual obligations.  

Inflation and Changes in Prices  

Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Natural gas, NGLs and oil prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. We expect costs in 2020 to continue to be a function of supply and demand. Natural gas and oil prices have remained depressed. We continue to experience a decline in our cost structure.  

Management’s Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates  

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year-end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (1) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and  

65 

(2) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 

Estimated Quantities of Net Reserves  

We use the successful efforts method of accounting for natural gas and oil producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method. We believe that net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting than under the full cost method, particularly during periods of active exploration. One difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is that under the successful efforts method, all exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical costs are charged against earnings during the periods they occur; whereas, under the full cost method of accounting, such costs are capitalized as assets, pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense. Under the successful efforts method of accounting, successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and these costs are systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed natural gas and oil reserves as estimated by our engineers and audited by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (2) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Proven property leasehold costs are amortized to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Properties are assessed for impairment as circumstances warrant (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes.  

Proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of natural gas, NGLs, condensate and crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves include reserves for which a development plan has been adopted indicating each location is scheduled to be drilled within five years from the date it was booked as proved reserves, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in natural gas, NGLs and oil prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in our depletion rates. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Senior Vice President of Reservoir Engineering and Economics, who reports directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum consultants to audit our estimates of proved reserves. Estimates prepared by third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein. Independent petroleum consultants audited approximately 90% of our reserves in 2019 compared to 94% in 2018. Historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 5%. The reserves included in this report are those reserves estimated by our petroleum engineering staff. For additional discussion, see Items 1 & 2. Business and Properties – Proved Reserves. 

Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. While total depletion expense for the life of a property is limited to the property’s total cost, proved reserve revisions result in a change in the timing of when depletion expense is recognized. Downward revisions of proved reserves may result in an acceleration of depletion expense, while upward revisions tend to lower the rate of depletion expense recognition. Based on proved reserves at December 31, 2019, we estimate that a 1% change in proved reserves would increase or decrease 2020 depletion expense by approximately $4.0 million (based on current production estimates). Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from property asset groups, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to natural gas and oil producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. It should not be assumed that the standardized measure is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves. 

Fair Value Estimates 

Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There are three approaches for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities: the market approach, the income approach and the cost approach, each of which includes multiple valuation techniques. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to measure fair value by converting future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, into a single present value, or range of present values, using current market expectations about those future amounts. The cost approach is based on the amount that would currently be required to replace the service capacity of an asset. This is often referred  

66 

to as current replacement cost. The cost approach assumes that the fair value would not exceed what it would cost a market participant to acquire or construct a substitute asset of comparable utility, adjusted for obsolescence. 

The fair value accounting standards do not prescribe which valuation technique should be used when measuring fair value and does not prioritize among the techniques. These standards establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in applying the various valuation techniques. Inputs broadly refer to the assumptions that market participants use to make pricing decisions, including assumptions about risk. Level 1 inputs are given the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy, while Level 3 inputs are given the lowest priority. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

•  

Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets as of the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.  

•  

Level 2-Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data. These are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the measurement date.  

•  

Level 3-Unobservable inputs for which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability being measured. These inputs reflect management’s best estimates of the assumptions market participants would use in determining fair value. Our Level 3 measurements consist of instruments using standard pricing models and other valuation methods that utilize unobservable pricing inputs that are significant to the overall value.  

Valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs are favored. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest priority level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the placement of assets and liabilities within the levels of the fair value hierarchy. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our fair value measurements.  

Impairment Assessments of Natural Gas and Oil Properties 

Long-lived assets in use are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable, including a significant reduction in prices of natural gas, oil, condensate and NGLs, reductions to our capital budget, unfavorable adjustments to reserves, significant changes in the expected timing of production and other changes to contracts or changes in the regulatory environment in which a property is located. For purposes of an impairment evaluation, long-lived assets must be grouped at the lowest level for which independent cash flows can be identified, which generally is field-by-field, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure or contractual terms that cause economic interdependency amongst separate, discrete fields. If the sum of the undiscounted estimated cash flows from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition is less than the carrying value of an asset group, the carrying value is written down to the estimated fair value. During 2019, a change in business strategy employed by management in North Louisiana and the possibility of a divestiture of these assets triggered an assessment of these long-lived assets for impairment. We estimated the fair values using a discounted net cash flow model or an income approach and we recognized an impairment. As of December 31, 2019, our estimated undiscounted cash flows relating to our remaining long-lived assets significantly exceeded their carrying values. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of impairments recorded in 2019, 2018 and 2017 and the related fair value measurements. 

Fair value calculated for the purpose of testing our natural gas and oil properties for impairment is estimated using the present value of expected future cash flows method and comparative market prices when appropriate. Significant judgment is involved in performing these fair value estimates since the results are based on forecasted assumptions. Significant assumptions include: 

•  

Future crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices. Our estimates of future prices are based on market information including published futures prices. Although these commodity prices may experience extreme volatility in any given year, we believe long-term industry prices are driven by market supply and demand. The prices we use in our fair value estimates are consistent with those used in our planning and capital investment reviews. There has been significant volatility in crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas prices and estimates of such future prices are inherently imprecise. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on commodity prices. 

•  

Estimated quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. Such quantities are based on risk adjusted proved and probable reserves and resources such that the combined volumes represent the most likely expectation of recovery. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion on reserves. 

•  

Expected timing of production. Production forecasts are the outcome of engineering studies which estimate reserves, as well as expected capital programs. The actual timing of the production could be different than the projection. Cash flows realized later in the projection period are less valuable than those realized earlier due to the time value of money. The expected timing of production that we use in our fair value estimates is consistent with that used in our planning and capital investment reviews. 

67 

•  

Discount rate commensurate with the risks involved. We apply a discount rate to our expected cash flows based on a variety of factors, including market and economic conditions, operational risk, regulatory risk and political risk. A higher discount rate decreases the net present value of cash flows. 

•  

Future capital requirements. Our estimates of future capital requirements consider the assumptions utilized by management for internal planning and budgeting. 

We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information which we believe to be reasonably likely to occur. An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in assumptions in our undiscounted cash flow calculations is not practicable, given the numerous assumptions (e.g. reserves, pace and timing of development plans, commodity prices, capital expenditures, operating costs, drilling and development costs, inflation and discount rates) that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the above listed assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future undiscounted cash flows would likely be partially offset by lower costs. 

We also evaluate our unproved property investment periodically for impairment. The majority of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leaseholds and allocated probable and possible reserve value resulting from acquisitions. The costs are capitalized and evaluated (at least quarterly) as to recoverability based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. Impairment of a significant portion of our unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis based on our average holding period, expected forfeiture rate and anticipated drilling success. Potential impairment of individually significant unproved property is assessed on a property-by-property basis considering a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors. A portion of unproved property may relate to probable and possible reserves whose recoverability is evaluated based on management expectations and ability to drill these locations. In certain circumstances, our future plans to develop acreage may accelerate our impairment. In 2019, a $1.2 billion impairment was recorded associated with our North Louisiana assets where we no longer have the intent to drill locations based on a shift in capital allocation which materially impacted our drilling inventory. We have recorded abandonment and impairment expense related to unproved properties of $1.2 billion in 2019 compared to $515.0 million in 2018. 

Natural Gas, NGLs and Oil Derivatives  

All derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value. Fair value measurements for all of our derivatives are based upon, among other things, option pricing models, futures, volatility, time to maturity and credit risk and are discussed in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional information about derivatives and their valuation may be found in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 

Asset Retirement Obligations  

We have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore the surface at the end of natural gas and oil production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations.  

Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit-adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation (“ARO”), a corresponding adjustment is made to the natural gas and oil property balance. For example, as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information, we may revise our estimate of current costs, the assumed annual inflation of the costs and/or the assumed productive lives of our wells. During 2019, we increased our existing ARO by $7.1 million or approximately 2% of the ARO balance at December 31, 2018 primarily related to increases in our estimated costs to plug and abandon wells in North Louisiana. During 2018, we increased our existing ARO by $12.0 million or approximately 4% of the ARO balance at December 31, 2017 primarily related to an increase in our estimated costs to plug and abandon wells in Pennsylvania. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures regarding our asset retirement obligation estimates. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of depletion, depreciation and amortization in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells, the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates. An estimate of the sensitivity to operating results of other assumptions that had been used in recording these liabilities is not practical because of the number of obligations that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of possible assumptions.

Income Taxes  

We are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate. For financial reporting purposes, we provide taxes at rates applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Estimates of amounts of income tax involve interpretation of complex tax laws, including the 2017 Tax Act. 

Our consolidated balance sheets include deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets arise when expenses are recognized in the financial statements before they are recognized in the tax returns or when income items are recognized in the tax returns before they are recognized in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets also arise when operating losses or tax credits are available to offset tax payments due in future years. Ultimately, realization of a deferred tax asset depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income within the future periods to absorb future deductible temporary differences, loss carryforwards or credits.  

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management must consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers all available evidence (both positive and negative) in determining whether a valuation allowance is required. Such evidence includes the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment and judgment is required in considering the relative weight of negative and positive evidence. We continue to monitor facts and circumstances in the reassessment of the likelihood that operating loss carryforwards, credits and other deferred tax assets will be utilized prior to their expiration. As a result, we may determine that an additional deferred tax asset valuation allowance should be established. 

In assessing facts and circumstances surrounding the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we are required to apply judgment to determine the weight of both positive and negative evidence in order to conclude whether the valuation allowance is necessary to net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. In determining whether a valuation allowance is required for our deferred tax asset balances, we consider, among other factors, current financial position, results of operations, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and new legislation. Significant judgment is involved in this determination as we are required to make assumptions about future commodity prices, projected production, development activities, profitability of future business strategies and forecasted economics in the oil and gas industry. Additionally, changes in the effective tax rate resulting from changes in tax law and our level of earnings may limit utilization of deferred tax assets and will affect valuation of deferred tax balances in the future. Changes in judgment regarding future realization of deferred tax assets may result in a reversal of all or a portion of the valuation allowance. In the period that determination is made, our net income will benefit from a lower effective tax rate. 

We believe our net deferred tax assets, after valuation allowances, will ultimately be realized. During 2019, we increased our valuation allowances against our state net operating loss carryforwards, basis differences and credits from $101.4 million as of December 31, 2018 to $158.3 million as of December 31, 2019. The federal valuation allowances increased from $19.0 million as of December 31, 2018 to $32.5 million as of December 31, 2019. See Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our income taxes. 

An estimate of the sensitivity to changes in our assumptions resulting in future income calculations is not practical, given the numerous assumptions that can materially affect our estimates. Unfavorable adjustments to some of the assumptions would likely be offset by favorable adjustments in other assumptions. For example, the impact of sustained reduced commodity prices on future taxable income would likely be partially offset by lower capital expenditures. 

We may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and/or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes, income or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters.  

Contingent Liabilities  

A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, we often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and/or the courts. Actual costs can differ from estimates for many reasons. We monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information. Although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely, particularly our outstanding litigation, we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities. We generally record losses related to these type of contingencies as general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Stock-based Compensation Arrangements 

The fair value of performance-based share awards (where the performance condition is based on market conditions) is estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation method. A Monte Carlo simulation model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the award grant. The fair value of restricted stock awards and performance-based awards where the performance condition is based on internal performance metrics is determined based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant.  

We recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. The expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and adjust it as circumstances warrant. See Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements for more information.
