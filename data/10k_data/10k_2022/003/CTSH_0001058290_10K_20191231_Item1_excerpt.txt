Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services.

Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included at the end of Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Business Segments

We go to market across our four industry-based business segments. Our clients seek to partner with service providers that have a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures and the ability to create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. Across industries, our clients are confronted with the risk of being disrupted by nimble, digital-native competitors. They are therefore redirecting their focus and investment to digital and embracing DevOps and key technologies like IoT, analytics, AI, digital engineering, cloud and automation. We believe that our deep knowledge of the industries we serve and our clients’ businesses has been central to our revenue growth and high client satisfaction, and we continue to invest in those digital capabilities that help to enable our clients to become modern businesses. Our business segments are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our Financial Services segment includes banking, capital markets and insurance companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ need to be compliant with significant regulatory requirements and adaptable to regulatory change, and their adoption and integration of digital technologies, including customer experience enhancement, robotic process automation, analytics and AI in areas such as digital lending, fraud detection and next generation payments.

Our Healthcare segment consists of healthcare providers and payers as well as life sciences companies, including pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device companies. Demand in this segment is driven by emerging industry trends, including enhanced compliance, integrated health management, claims investigative services and heightened focus on patient experience, as well as services that drive operational improvements in areas such as claims processing, enrollment, membership and billing. Demand is also created by the adoption and integration of digital technologies such as AI to shape personalized care plans and predictive data analytics to improve patient outcomes. 

Our Products and Resources segment includes manufacturers, retailers and travel and hospitality companies, as well as companies providing logistics, energy and utility services. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ focus on improving the efficiency of their operations, the enablement and integration of mobile platforms to support sales and other omni-channel commerce initiatives, and their adoption and integration of digital technologies, such as the application of intelligent systems to manage supply chains and enhance overall customer experiences, and IoT to instrument functions for factories, real estate, fleets and products to increase access to insight generating data.

Our Communications, Media and Technology segment includes information, media and entertainment, communications and technology companies. Demand in this segment is driven by our clients’ needs to create differentiated user experiences, transition to agile development methodologies, enhance their networks, manage their digital content and adopt and integrate digital technologies, such as cloud, interactive and IoT.

See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to disaggregation of revenues by client location, service line and contract-type for each of our business segments. 

Services and Solutions

Our services include digital services and solutions, consulting, application development, systems integration, application testing, application maintenance, infrastructure services and business process services. Additionally, we develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products and platforms. Central to our strategy to align with our clients’ need to modernize is our investment in four key areas of digital: IoT, AI, digital engineering and cloud. These four capabilities enable clients to put data at the core of their operations, improve the experiences they offer their customers, tap into new revenue streams, defend against technology-enabled competitors and reduce costs. In many cases, our clients' new digital systems are built upon the backbone of their existing legacy systems. Also, clients often look for efficiencies in the way they run their operations so they can fund investments in new digital technologies. We believe our deep knowledge of their infrastructure and systems provides us with a significant advantage as we work with them to build new digital capabilities to make their operations more efficient and effective. We deliver all of our services and solutions across our four industry-based business segments to best address our clients' individual needs. 

We seek to drive organic growth through investments in our digital capabilities across industries and geographies, including the extensive training and re-skilling of our technical teams and the expansion of our local workforces in the United States and other markets around the world where we operate. Additionally, we pursue select strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and alliances that can expand our digital capabilities or the geographic or industry coverage of our business. In 2019, we completed five such acquisitions: 

•Mustache, a creative content agency based in the United States, that extends our capabilities in creating original and branded content for digital, broadcast and social mediums;

•Meritsoft, a financial software company based in Ireland, that complements our service offerings to capital markets institutions;

•Samlink, a developer of services and solutions for the financial sector based in Finland, that strengthens our banking capabilities and brings with it a strategic partnership with three Finnish financial institutions to transform and operate a shared core banking platform;

•Zenith, a life sciences company based in Ireland, that extends our service capabilities for connected biopharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers; and

•Contino, a technology consulting firm that extends our capabilities in enterprise DevOps and cloud transformation.

Global Delivery Model

We utilize a global delivery model, with delivery centers worldwide to provide the full range of services we offer to our clients. Our delivery model includes employees deployed at client sites, local or in-country delivery centers, regional delivery centers and offshore delivery centers, as required to best serve our clients. As we scale our digital services and solutions, we are focused on hiring in the United States and other countries where we deliver services to our clients to expand our in-country delivery capabilities. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure are designed to enable the effective collaboration of our global workforce across locations and geographies.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our many offices around the world. We are increasing our investment in sales and marketing professionals to help us expand existing accounts and acquire new ones, and amplify our brand's stature in the marketplace. These new investments are designed to support and enhance the sales and marketing group, which works with our client delivery team as the sales process moves closer to a client's selection of a services provider. The duration of the sales process may vary widely depending on the type and complexity of services. 

Clients

The services we provide are distributed among a number of clients in each of our business segments. Revenues from our top clients as a percentage of total revenues were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

A loss of a significant client or a few significant clients in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for that segment. The services we provide to our larger clients are often critical to their operations and a termination of our services would typically require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. Nevertheless, the volume of work performed for specific clients may vary significantly from year to year.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced that we will exit certain content-related work that is not in line with our long-term strategic vision for the Company. We intend to exit this work in 2020 and this may negatively impact our relationship with the affected clients and the revenues from other services we provide to them. Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information.

Competition

The markets for our services are highly competitive, characterized by a large number of participants and subject to rapid change. Competitors may include systems integration firms, contract programming companies, application software companies, cloud computing service providers, traditional consulting firms, professional services groups of computer equipment companies, infrastructure management companies, outsourcing companies and boutique digital companies. Our direct competitors include, among others, Accenture, Atos, Capgemini, Deloitte Digital, DXC Technology, EPAM Systems, Genpact, HCL Technologies, IBM Global Services, Infosys Technologies, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. In addition, we compete with numerous smaller local companies in the various geographic markets in which we operate.

The principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our services include the provider’s reputation and experience, vision and strategic advisory capabilities, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services. Accordingly, we rely on the following to compete effectively:

•investments to scale our digital services;

•our recruiting, training and retention model;

•our global delivery model;

•an entrepreneurial culture and approach to our work;

•a broad client referral base;
