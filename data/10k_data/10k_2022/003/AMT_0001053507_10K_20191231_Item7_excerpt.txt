ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the accompanying notes, and the information set forth under the caption “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below. 

During the fourth quarter of 2019, as a result of recent acquisitions, including the Eaton Towers Acquisition, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments to divide our EMEA segment into two separate segments, Africa property and Europe property. We now report our results in six segments – U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property and services. We believe this change provides more visibility into these operating segments and better aligns our reporting with management’s current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments. In evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). The change in reportable segments has no impact on our consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments. 

Executive Overview

We are one of the largest global REITs and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 and includes our U.S. property, Asia property, Africa property, Europe property and Latin America property segments. 

We also offer tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. 

22
The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of December 31, 2019: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1)Approximately 95% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term finance leases, including those subject to purchase options. 

(2)In India and South Africa, we also own fiber. 

(3)In Argentina and Brazil, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, and the rights to utilize certain existing utility infrastructure for future telecommunications equipment installation. 

(4)In Mexico, we also own or operate urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, concrete poles and other infrastructure. 

In most of our markets, our tenant leases with wireless carriers generally have initial non-cancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, the vast majority of the revenue generated by our property operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2019, we expect to generate nearly $46.9 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. 

The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee.

Revenue lost from either tenant lease cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent renegotiations, which we refer to as churn, has historically not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our consolidated property operations. 

23
During the year ended December 31, 2019, churn was approximately 6% of our tenant billings. The higher than historical level of churn was largely due to carrier consolidation events in India. 

Beginning in late 2017, we experienced an increase in revenue lost from cancellations or non-renewals primarily due to carrier consolidation-driven churn in India, which compressed our gross margin and operating profit, particularly in our Asia property segment, although this impact was partially offset by lower expenses due to reduced tenancy on existing sites and the decommissioning of certain sites. 

We anticipate that our churn rate in India will move closer to historical levels over time and result in reduced impacts on our property revenue, gross margin and operating profit. In the immediate term, we expect that our churn rate will remain elevated, primarily due the uncertainty created by the recent court ruling by the Indian Supreme Court, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under under the captions “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants” and “Risk Factors—Our business, and that of our tenants, is subject to laws, regulations and administrative and judicial decisions, and changes thereto, that could restrict our ability to operate our business as we currently do or impact our competitive landscape.” We expect to periodically evaluate the carrying value of our Indian assets, which may result in the realization of additional impairment expense or other similar charges. For more information, please see the information under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.”

For the year ended December 31, 2019, aggregate carrier consolidation in India negatively impacted our consolidated property revenue by $361.3 million, including approximately $84.2 million in pass-through revenue, and negatively impacted our gross margin and operating profit by $247.7 million.

Property Operations Revenue Growth. Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation capital expenditures.

The primary factors affecting the revenue growth of our property segments are:

•Growth in tenant billings, including:

•New revenue attributable to leases in place on day one on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period;

•New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites (“colocations”) and lease amendments; and

•Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn. 

•Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments primarily to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs included in certain tenant leases (“pass-through”), straight-line revenue and decommissioning.

We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services globally and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our communications real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites’ utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers, with tenants in a number of other industries contributing incremental leasing demand. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives. 

Property Operations Organic Revenue Growth. Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment from our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers and other tenants deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the level of emphasis on network quality and capacity in carrier competition, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions. According to industry data, recent aggregate annual wireless capital spending in the United States has averaged approximately $30.0 billion, resulting in consistent demand for our sites. 

24
Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us:

•In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments over the long term.

•Subscribers’ use of mobile data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing mobile data usage.

•The deployment of advanced mobile technology, such as 4G and 5G, across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks.

•Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage. 

•Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum.

•Next generation technologies requiring wireless connectivity have the potential to provide incremental revenue opportunities for us. These technologies may include autonomous vehicle networks and a number of other internet-of-things, or IoT, applications, as well as other potential use cases for wireless services. These technologies may create new and complementary use cases for our communications real estate over time, although these use cases are currently in nascent stages.

As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers to increase the opportunities for growth or mutually beneficial transactional opportunities across common markets. We believe that consistent carrier network investments across our international markets will, over the long term, position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward.

In emerging markets, such as Burkina Faso, Ghana, India, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in certain underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low. In more developed urban locations within these markets, data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as mobile data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate. 

In India, the ongoing transition from 2G technology to 4G technology has included a period of carrier consolidation, whereby the number of carriers operating in the marketplace has been reduced through mergers, acquisitions and select carrier exits from the marketplace, which we believe is now substantially complete. We believe that this consolidation process has resulted in an industry structure for both the wireless carriers and communications infrastructure providers that is expected to be more conducive to sustained growth and profitability over time. 

In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are increasingly focused on 4G network build outs, with certain continuing legacy investments in 3G. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, in particular as lower cost smartphones become increasingly available. As a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are advancing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks to maintain and augment their quality of service.

25
Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany and France, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity.

We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will be replicated in our less advanced international markets over time. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately 138,545 communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier tenants to drive sustainable, long-term growth.

We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Certain of those master lease agreements are holistic in nature and further build and augment strong strategic partnerships with our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites.

Demand for our communications sites could be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including an increase in network sharing or consolidation among our tenants, as set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the captions “Risk Factors—If our tenants consolidate their operations, exit the telecommunications business or share site infrastructure to a significant degree, our growth, revenue and ability to generate positive cash flows could be materially and adversely affected” and “Risk Factors—A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of tenants, and we are sensitive to adverse changes in the creditworthiness and financial strength of our tenants.” In addition, the emergence and growth of new technologies could reduce demand for our sites, as set forth under the caption “Risk Factors—New technologies or changes in our or a tenant’s business model could make our tower leasing business less desirable and result in decreasing revenues and operating results.” Further, our tenants may be subject to new regulatory policies from time to time that materially and adversely affect the demand for our communications sites.

Property Operations New Site Revenue Growth. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we grew our portfolio of communications real estate through the acquisition and construction of approximately 13,705 sites globally. In a majority of our Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America markets, the revenue generated from newly acquired or constructed sites resulted in increases in both tenant and pass-through revenues (such as ground rent or power and fuel costs) and expenses. We continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire communications real estate portfolios, both domestically and internationally, to determine whether they meet our risk-adjusted hurdle rates and whether we believe we can effectively integrate them into our existing portfolio.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Property Operations Expenses. Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments’ selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities.

Services Segment Revenue Growth. As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

26
Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted (“Adjusted EBITDA”), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“Nareit FFO”) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations (“Consolidated AFFO”) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) from equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. 

Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “Nareit FFO (common stockholders).” 

We define Consolidated AFFO as Nareit FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. 

We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both Nareit FFO (common stockholders) and the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as “AFFO (common stockholders).” 

Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO or AFFO (common stockholders) represents cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments’ performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust Nareit FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in Nareit FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry.

Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, Nareit FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.

•The increase in services segment gross margin was primarily due to an increase in revenue, as described above, partially offset by an increase in direct expenses of $14.4 million. 

Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense (“SG&A”)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Year Ended December 31, 2019 

•The increases in each of our U.S., Africa, Europe and Latin America property segment SG&A were primarily driven by increased personnel costs to support our business, including our acquisitions of urban telecommunications assets in our Latin America property segment and the Kenya Acquisition. 

•The decrease in our Asia property segment SG&A was primarily driven by a decrease in bad debt expense of $9.3 million. 

•The decrease in our services segment SG&A was primarily attributable to a decrease in the allocation of personnel costs to our tower services group.

•The decrease in other SG&A was primarily attributable to $19.1 million of incremental stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration of expense associated with amendments to existing grants during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Year Ended December 31, 2018

•The increase in our Asia property segment SG&A was primarily driven by an increase in bad debt expense of $25.1 million as a result of receivable reserves with certain tenants.

•The increase in our services segment SG&A was primarily attributable to an increase in the allocation of personnel costs to our tower services group.

•The increase in other SG&A was primarily attributable to an increase in stock-based compensation expense of $28.6 million, principally due to the acceleration of expense associated with amendments to existing grants, and an increase in corporate SG&A.

Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to the accelerated amortization of a tenant relationship intangible asset as a result of the settlement with Tata in 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase resulting from the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. 

The increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to $327.5 million of accelerated amortization of a tenant relationship intangible asset as a result of the settlement with Tata. Also contributing to the increase was the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization.

Other Operating Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to decreases in impairment charges of $299.8 million and losses on sales or disposals of assets of $40.5 million. 

33
The increase in other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to an increase in impairment charges of $182.6 million and an increase of $52.8 million in losses on sales or disposals of assets. The impairment charges included $258.3 million related to tower and network intangible assets and $107.3 million related to tenant relationships in our Asia property segment due to the settlement with Tata, Aircel Ltd.’s (“Aircel”) filing for bankruptcy protection and other carrier consolidation-driven churn in India. The increase was also attributable to the nonrecurrence of a $22.2 million refund of acquisition costs recorded in the prior-year period related to an acquisition in Brazil, partially offset by $10.0 million to fund our charitable foundation in the 2017.

Total Other Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total other expense consists primarily of interest expense and realized and unrealized foreign currency gains and losses. We record unrealized foreign currency gains or losses as a result of foreign currency fluctuations primarily associated with our intercompany notes and similar unaffiliated balances denominated in a currency other than the subsidiaries’ functional currencies.

The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to (i) a decrease in other income of $16.8 million, primarily due to the nonrecurrence of a gain of $9.7 million associated with the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca during the year ended December 31, 2018 and (ii) an increase in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $18.9 million primarily due to a loss of $22.1 million, attributable to the repayment of the 5.050% senior unsecured notes due 2020 (the “5.050% Notes”). These items were partially offset by foreign currency gains of $6.1 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the prior-year period and a decrease in net interest expense of $3.4 million.

The increase in total other expense during the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily due to additional interest expense of $75.9 million due to a $2.0 billion increase in our average debt outstanding and foreign currency losses of $4.5 million in the current period, compared to foreign currency gains of $26.4 million in the prior-year period. The increase was partially offset by (i) a decrease in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $66.9 million due to the nonrecurrence of a loss of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period attributable to the redemptions of the 7.25% senior unsecured notes due 2019 and the 4.500% senior unsecured notes due 2018 and the repayment of the Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-2 Class A, Series 2012-2 Class B and Series 2012-2 Class C and Secured Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2010-2, Class C and Series 2010-2, Class F, (ii) an increase in other income of $23.4 million partially due to the write-offs of the capital lease liability and Economic Rights Agreement and related amortization in conjunction with the note extinguishment with TV Azteca and (iii) an additional $19.3 million in interest income, compared to the prior-year period.

Income Tax (Benefit) Provision 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As a REIT, we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our NOLs, subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 differs from the federal statutory rate.

The decrease in the income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period, offset by a $113.0 million benefit arising from revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in India. The income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was favorably impacted by certain events in India and a one-time benefit, discussed below. 

The change in the income tax (benefit) provision for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a decrease in foreign earnings subject to taxation in the current period, primarily resulting from impairment charges and accelerated amortization in India, and a one-time benefit of $85.7 million related to the restructuring of international operations 

34
in certain jurisdictions. The income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2017 was favorably impacted by a clarification in income tax law in Ghana.

(2)For the year ended December 31, 2019, amount includes a tax benefit of $113.0 million as a result of revaluing our net deferred tax liability due to tax law changes in India. For the year ended December 31, 2018, amount includes a tax benefit primarily attributable to the tax effect of an increase in impairment charges and a one-time benefit for restructuring-related activity in foreign jurisdictions offset by the nonrecurrence of prior-year benefit from a clarification in income tax law in Ghana.

(3)Relates to the payment of capitalized interest associated with the shareholder loan previously owed to our joint venture partner in Ghana (see note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). This long-term deferred interest was previously expensed but excluded from Consolidated AFFO.

(4)Includes (gains) losses on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations of ($6.1 million), $4.5 million and ($26.4 million), respectively.

(5)Primarily includes acquisition-related costs and integration costs. For the year ended December 31, 2019, amount also includes the receipt of $13.1 million related to pre-acquisition contingencies and settlements. For the year ended December 31, 2017, amount also includes refunds for acquisition costs and a charitable contribution.

(6)Includes adjustments for the impact on both Nareit FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as well as the other line items included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. 

Year Ended December 31, 2019 

The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit, a decrease in other operating expenses, primarily related to a decrease in impairment charges of $299.8 million and a decrease in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a change in the income tax benefit and an increase in loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $18.9 million during the period, attributable to the repayment of the 5.050% Notes.

36
The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG&A, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense, of $22.8 million.

The decrease in Consolidated AFFO was primarily the result of a decrease in our operating profit, excluding the impact of straight-line accounting, and increases in capital improvement and corporate capital expenditures, partially offset by a decrease in the income tax benefit net of deferred amounts and a decrease in dividends on preferred stock.

The increase in AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was attributable to lower adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests primarily as a result of a decrease in the operating profit in our Asia property segment due to our October 2018 settlement with Tata, partially offset by the decrease in Consolidated AFFO described above. 

Year Ended December 31, 2018 

The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit, the change in the income tax (benefit) provision and the nonrecurrence of a loss on retirement of long-term obligations of $70.2 million recorded in the prior-year period, partially offset by an increase in other operating expenses, primarily related to an increase in impairment charges of $182.6 million, and increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and interest expense.

The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A of $67.6 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense.

The growth in Consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, a decrease in dividends on preferred stock and a decrease in the adjustment for straight-line revenue, partially offset by increases in cash paid for interest, capital improvement capital expenditures and corporate SG&A.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Overview 

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased our financial flexibility and our ability to grow our business while maintaining our long-term financial policies. Our significant 2019 financing transactions included:

•Unsecured $1.3 billion term loan due February 13, 2020 (the “2019 364-Day Term Loan”). 

•Registered public offerings in an aggregate amount of $4.9 billion of senior unsecured notes with maturities ranging from 2024 to 2049.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table summarizes our liquidity as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we made net repayments of $600.0 million under the 2019 Credit Facility, including repayments of approximately $1,483.4 million using the proceeds from our issuance of the 2.400% Notes and 2.900% Notes (each as defined below), and made net borrowings of $271.8 million under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility. The borrowings were used to repay existing indebtedness and for general corporate purposes. 

Summary cash flow information is set forth below for the years ended December 31, (in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness or equity from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. 

In April 2019, Tata Teleservices and Tata Sons Limited, two of our minority holders in India, delivered notice of exercise of their put options with respect to their remaining combined holdings in our Indian subsidiary, ATC TIPL (see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report). Accordingly, we expect to pay an amount equivalent to INR 24.8 billion (approximately $347.6 million at the December 31, 2019 exchange rate) to redeem the put shares in the first half of 2020, subject to regulatory approval. In connection with the closing of the Eaton Towers Acquisition (see note 7 to our 

38
consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), we entered into an agreement with MTN to acquire MTN’s noncontrolling interests in each of our joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda for total consideration of approximately $523.0 million. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions.

As of December 31, 2019, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $24.2 billion, with a current portion of $2.9 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe the cash generated by operating activities during the year ending December 31, 2020, together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.3 billion of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $583.0 million was held by our joint ventures. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay certain taxes. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

For the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities increased $4.3 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, include:

•An increase in non-cash operating activities, including an increase of approximately $95.9 million in straight-line revenue and a decrease of approximately $13.5 million in straight-line expense;

•An increase in our operating profit of $78.4 million; and

•A decrease of approximately $39.5 million in cash paid for interest. 

For the year ended December 31, 2018 cash provided by operating activities increased $822.7 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The primary factors that impacted cash provided by operating activities as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, include:

•An increase in our operating profit of $594.5 million;

•A decrease in cash required for working capital, primarily as a result of accounts receivable collection; and

•An increase of approximately $27.4 million in cash paid for taxes. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Our significant investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2019 are highlighted below: 

•We spent approximately $3.0 billion for acquisitions, primarily related to the Eaton Towers Acquisition, the Entel Acquisition, and asset acquisitions in the United States, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru.

We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while maintaining our commitment to our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions. We also regularly review our tower portfolios as to capital expenditures required to upgrade our towers to our structural standards or address capacity, structural or permitting issues. 

We expect that our 2020 total capital expenditures will be as follows (in millions):

2020 Term Loan—On February 13, 2020, we entered into a $750.0 million unsecured term loan (the “2020 Term Loan”), the net proceeds of which were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan. The 2020 Term Loan matures on February 12, 2021 and has an interest rate that is 0.65% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or 0.00% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings. Any outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest will be due and payable in full at maturity.

The 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the LIBOR as the applicable base rate for borrowings under these bank facilities.

The loan agreements for each of the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable.

India Indebtedness—During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid all remaining debt assumed in connection with the Viom Acquisition and debt entered into by ATC TIPL. The remaining India indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that consist of the applicable bank’s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (as defined in the applicable agreement), plus a spread. 

43
Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. Amounts outstanding and key terms of the India indebtedness consisted of the following as of December 31, 2019 (in millions, except percentages):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______

(1) 5.6 billion INR ($78.9 million) of borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2019. 

Stock Repurchase Programs—We have two stock repurchase programs, the 2011 Buyback and the 2017 Buyback.

 During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 93,654 shares of our common stock under the 2011 Buyback for an aggregate of $19.6 million, including commissions and fees. We had no repurchases under the 2017 Buyback.

Under each program, we are authorized to purchase shares from time to time through open market purchases or in privately negotiated transactions not to exceed market prices and subject to market conditions and other factors. With respect to open market purchases, we may use plans adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act in accordance with securities laws and other legal requirements, which allows us to repurchase shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. These programs may be discontinued at any time.

We expect to continue managing the pacing of the remaining $2.1 billion under the Buyback Programs in response to general market conditions and other relevant factors. We expect to fund further repurchases of our common stock through a combination of cash on hand, cash generated by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities. Purchases under the Buyback Programs are subject to us having available cash to fund repurchases. 

Sales of Equity Securities—We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (the “ESPP”) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plan. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we received an aggregate of $105.5 million in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and sales pursuant to the ESPP.

Distributions—As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $7.4 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in January 2020, primarily classified as ordinary income that may be treated as qualified REIT dividends under Section 199A of the Code for taxable years ending after 2017 and before 2026. 

The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $3.61 per share, or $1.6 billion, to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of $1.01 per share, or $447.3 million, paid on January 14, 2020 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on December 27, 2019.

We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $14.3 million and $13.7 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid $7.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. 

For more details on the cash distributions paid to our common stockholders during the year ended December 31, 2019, see note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

44
Contractual Obligations—The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 (in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1)Repaid in full on February 13, 2020. 

(2)On January 15, 2020, we redeemed all of the 5.900% Notes.

45
debt entered into by our Kenyan subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of sites in Kenya (the “Kenya Debt”), which is required to be paid either (i) in future installments subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions or (ii) three years from the note origination date, U.S. subsidiary debt related to a seller-financed acquisition (the “U.S. Subsidiary Debt”) and debt entered into by certain Eaton Towers subsidiaries acquired in connection with the Eaton Towers Acquisition (the “Eaton Towers Debt”), which is denominated in U.S. Dollar (“USD”), EUR, Kenyan Shilling (“KES”) and West African CFA Franc. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we repaid all of the outstanding Eaton Towers USD denominated and KES denominated debt. 

(7)Includes payments under non-cancellable initial terms, as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option, which we expect to renew because failure to do so could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related revenues from tenant leases.

(8)Primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other non-current liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily unearned revenue that is not payable in cash. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements—We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity

Our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent our material debt agreements that contain covenants, our compliance with which would be material to an investor’s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity.

Internally Generated Funds—Because the majority of our tenant leases are multiyear contracts, a significant majority of the revenues generated by our property operations as of the end of 2019 is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Accordingly, a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies. In addition, our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities depends upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites.

Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities—The loan agreements for the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, the 2019 Credit Facility, the 2019 Term Loan and the 2020 Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1) Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement.

(2) Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA.

(3) Assumes no change to our debt levels. 

(4) Effectively, however, additional Senior Secured Debt under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio.

The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants.

Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand 

46
to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants.

Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations—The indenture and related supplemental indentures governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the “Series 2015-1 Notes”) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the “Series 2015-2 Notes,” and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the “2015 Notes”) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC (“GTP Acquisition Partners”) in the 2015 Securitization and the loan agreement related to Trust Securitizations, as discussed further in note 9 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, GTP Acquisition Partners and American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the “AMT Asset Subs”) are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement).

Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan made by the American Tower Trust I (the “Trust”) to the AMT Asset Subs (the “Loan”), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of December 31, 2019, $63.1 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash. 

Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the Trust Securitizations is set forth below. The debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1)Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of December 31, 2019 and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable. 

47
(2)Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. During a Cash Trap DSCR condition, all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments, fund required reserves, pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the applicable transaction documents, referred to as excess cash flow, will be deposited into a reserve account (the “Cash Trap Reserve Account”) instead of being released to the applicable issuer or borrower. 

(3)An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the “Minimum DSCR”) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. 

(4)No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow.

(5)An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full. 

A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions and meet REIT distribution requirements. During an “amortization period,” all excess cash flow and any amounts in the applicable Cash Trap Reserve Account would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of the Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,542 communications sites that secure the 2015 Notes or the 5,114 broadcast and wireless communications towers and related assets that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets.

As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our distribution requirements and repay or repurchase our debt. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements and debt service obligations or refinance our existing indebtedness. 

In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors,” we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to perform its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. This is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies. See note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a summary of our significant accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result.

•Impairment of Assets—Assets Subject to Depreciation and Amortization: We review long-lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events, changes in circumstances or other indicators or evidence indicate that the carrying amount of our assets may not be recoverable. 

48
We review our tower portfolio and network location intangible assets for indicators of impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, typically at an individual tower basis. Possible indicators include a tower not having current tenant leases or having expenses in excess of revenues. A cash flow modeling approach is utilized to assess recoverability and incorporates, among other items, the tower location, the tower location demographics, the timing of additions of new tenants, lease rates and estimated length of tenancy and ongoing cash requirements.

We review our tenant-related intangible assets on a tenant by tenant basis for indicators of impairment, such as high levels of turnover or attrition, non-renewal of a significant number of contracts or the cancellation or termination of a relationship. We assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying amount of the tenant-related intangible assets will be recovered primarily through projected undiscounted future cash flows. 

If the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of our long-lived assets is less than the carrying amount of the assets, an impairment loss may be recognized. Key assumptions included in the undiscounted cash flows are future revenue projections, estimates of ongoing tenancies and operating margins. An impairment loss would be based on the fair value of the asset, which is based on an estimate of discounted future cash flows to be provided from the asset. We record any related impairment charge in the period in which we identify such impairment.

In October 2019, the Indian Supreme Court issued a ruling regarding the definition of AGR and associated fees and charges that may have a material financial impact on certain of our tenants which could affect their ability to perform their obligations under agreements with us. We will continue to monitor the status of these developments, as it is possible that the estimated future cash flows may differ from current estimates and changes in estimated cash flows from tenants in India could have an impact on previously recorded tangible and intangible assets, including amounts originally recorded as tenant-related intangibles. The carrying value of tenant-related intangibles in India was $1,124.4 million as of December 31, 2019, which represents 12% of our consolidated balance of $8,999.5 million. Additionally, a significant reduction in tenant related cash flows in India could also impact our tower portfolio and network location intangibles. The carrying values of our tower portfolio and network location intangibles in India were $1,064.8 million and $483.4 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019, which represent 13% and 15% of our consolidated balances of $7,964.1 million and $3,230.4 million, respectively. 

•Impairment of Assets—Goodwill: We review goodwill for impairment at least annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.

Goodwill is recorded in the applicable segment and assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level. We utilize the two step impairment test and employ a discounted cash flow analysis when testing goodwill for impairment. The key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow analysis include current operating performance, terminal sales growth rate, management’s expectations of future operating results and cash requirements, the current weighted average cost of capital and an expected tax rate. Under the first step of this test, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated under an income approach using future discounted cash flows, to the carrying amount of the applicable reporting unit. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, we conduct the second step of this test, in which the implied fair value of the applicable reporting unit’s goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the excess.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, no potential impairment was identified as the fair value of each of our reporting units was in excess of its carrying amount. The fair value of our India reporting unit, which is based on the present value of forecasted future value cash flows (the income approach) exceeded the carrying value by approximately 7%. Key assumptions include future revenue growth rates and operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal period growth rate and the weighted-average cost of capital, which were determined considering historical data and current assumptions related to the impacts of the carrier consolidation, each of which could be impacted by our tenants’ ability to perform their contractual obligations as a result of the AGR ruling or otherwise. For this reporting unit, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our significant assumptions and determined that a (i) less than 1% reduction of projected revenues, (ii) 42 basis point increase in the weighted-average cost of capital or (iii) 17% reduction in terminal sales growth rate, individually, each of which we determined to be reasonable, would impact our conclusion that the fair value of the India reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. Events that could negatively affect our India reporting unit’s financial results include increased tenant attrition exceeding our forecast resulting from the ongoing carrier consolidation, carrier tenant bankruptcies and other factors set forth in Item 1A of this Annual Report under the caption “Risk Factors.” The carrying value of goodwill in the India reporting unit was $1,021.8 million as of December 31, 2019, which represents 17% of our consolidated balance of $6,178.3 million.

•Asset Retirement Obligations: When required, we recognize the fair value of obligations to remove our tower assets and remediate the leased land upon which certain of our tower assets are located. Generally, the associated retirement 

49
costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and the liability is accreted through the obligation’s estimated settlement date. 

We updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation, which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of $66.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in 2019 primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date and cost assumptions. Fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounting of estimated future cash flows. Periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is included in Depreciation, amortization and accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations. The significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are: timing of tower removals; cost of tower removals; timing and number of land lease renewals; expected inflation rates; and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate. While we feel the assumptions are appropriate, there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates. We will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary.

•Acquisitions: We evaluate each of our acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired, with no recognition of goodwill. For those acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination, we apply the acquisition method of accounting where assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value at the date of each acquisition, and the results of operations are included with our results from the dates of the respective acquisitions. Any excess of the purchase price paid over the amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. We continue to evaluate acquisitions accounted for as business combinations for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable acquisition date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is typically determined by using either estimates of replacement costs or discounted cash flow valuation methods. When determining the fair value of tangible assets acquired, we must estimate the cost to replace the asset with a new asset taking into consideration such factors as age, condition and the economic useful life of the asset. When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired, we must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future tenant cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition. 

•Revenue Recognition: Our revenue is derived from leasing the right to use our communications sites and the land on which the sites are located (the “lease component”) and from the reimbursement of costs incurred in operating the communications sites and supporting the tenants’ equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the “non-lease component”). Most of our revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, we separately determine the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation.

Our revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with our tenants, are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $183.5 million, $87.6 million and $194.4 million, respectively. Amounts billed upfront in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable lease arrangements. Amounts billed or received for services prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in Unearned revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets until the criteria for recognition have been met.

We derive the largest portion of our revenues, corresponding trade receivables and the related deferred rent asset from a small number of tenants in the telecommunications industry, with 54% of our revenues derived from four tenants. In addition, we have concentrations of credit risk in certain geographic areas. We mitigate the concentrations of credit risk with respect to notes and trade receivables by actively monitoring the creditworthiness of our borrowers and tenants. In recognizing tenant revenue we assess the collectibility of both the amounts billed and the portion recognized on a straight-line basis. This assessment takes tenant credit risk and business and industry conditions into consideration to ultimately determine the collectibility of the amounts billed. To the extent the amounts, based on management’s estimates, may not be collectible, recognition is deferred until such point as the uncertainty is resolved. Any amounts that were previously recognized as revenue and subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged to bad debt expense. Accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts related to estimated 

50
losses resulting from a tenant’s inability to make required payments and allowances for amounts invoiced whose collectibility is not reasonably assured.

•Rent Expense and Lease Accounting: Many of the leases underlying our tower sites have fixed rent escalations, which provide for periodic increases in the amount of ground rent payable over time. In addition, certain of our tenant leases require us to exercise available renewal options pursuant to the underlying ground lease if the tenant exercises its renewal option. We calculate straight-line ground rent expense for these leases based on the fixed non-cancellable term of the underlying ground lease plus all periods, if any, for which failure to renew the lease imposes an economic penalty to us such that renewal appears to be reasonably assured. 

Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted the new lease standard using the modified retrospective method applied to lease arrangements that were in place on the transition date. The new lease accounting guidance required us to recognize a right-of-use lease asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases. The right-of-use asset is measured as the sum of the lease liability, prepaid or accrued lease payments, any initial direct costs incurred and any other applicable amounts.

The calculation of the lease liability requires us to make certain assumptions for each lease, including lease term and discount rate implicit in each lease, which could significantly impact the gross lease obligation, the duration and the present value of the lease liability. When calculating the lease term, we consider the renewal, cancellation and termination rights available to us and the lessor. We determine the discount rate by calculating the incremental borrowing rate on a collateralized basis at the commencement of a lease or upon a change in the lease term.

•Income Taxes: Accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate the timing and impact of amounts recorded in our financial statements that may be recognized differently for tax purposes. To the extent that the timing of amounts recognized for financial reporting purposes differs from the timing of recognition for tax reporting purposes, deferred tax assets or liabilities are required to be recorded. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the rate at which we expect these items to be reflected in our tax returns, which may differ from the current rate. We do not expect to pay federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income.

We periodically review our deferred tax assets, and we record a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. Valuation allowances would be reversed as a reduction to the provision for income taxes, if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets’ recoverability.

We recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when, in management’s judgment, it is more likely than not that positions we have taken in our tax returns will be sustained upon examination, which are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. We adjust our tax liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information or information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which additional information is available or the position is ultimately settled under audit.
