Overview 

Hess Corporation is a global Exploration and Production (E&P) company engaged in exploration, development, production, transportation, purchase and sale of crude oil, NGL, and natural gas with production operations and development activities located primarily in the United States (U.S.), Guyana, the Malaysia/Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA), Malaysia, and Denmark. We conduct exploration activities primarily offshore Guyana, the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, and offshore Suriname and Canada. At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, we have announced sixteen significant discoveries. The Liza Phase 1 development achieved first production in December 2019, with peak production expected to reach up to 120,000 gross bopd. The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in the second quarter of 2019 and is expected to start up by early 2022 with production reaching up to 220,000 gross bopd. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2025. 

Our Midstream operating segment, which is comprised of Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP at December 31, 2019, provides fee-based services, including gathering, compressing and processing natural gas and fractionating NGL; gathering, terminaling, loading and transporting crude oil and NGL; storing and terminaling propane, and water handling services primarily in the Bakken shale play in the Williston Basin area of North Dakota. See Note 6, Hess Midstream in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

2020 Outlook 

Our E&P capital and exploratory expenditures are projected to be approximately $3.0 billion in 2020. Capital investment for our Midstream operations is expected to be approximately $350 million. Oil and gas net production in 2020 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 boepd to 335,000 boepd excluding Libya, up from 290,000 boepd in 2019, excluding Libya. Currently, we have West Texas Intermediate (WTI) put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd.  

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,642 million in 2019, compared with $1,939 million in 2018, while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2,237 million in 2019 and $2,129 million in 2018. Capital expenditures for 2019 and 2018 were $2,992 million and $2,180 million, respectively. In 2020, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2019 of $1.5 billion, and our available committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends. 

Consolidated Results 

Net loss attributable to Hess Corporation was $408 million in 2019 (2018: $282 million). Excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods summarized on page 30, the adjusted net loss was $281 million in 2019 (2018: $176 million). Annual net production averaged 311,000 boepd in 2019 (2018: 277,000 boepd). Total proved reserves were 1,197 million boe at December 31, 2019 (2018: 1,192 million boe).

Significant 2019 Activities 

The following is an update of significant E&P activities during 2019: 

E&P assets: 

•  

In North Dakota, net production from the Bakken shale play averaged 152,000 boepd (2018: 117,000 boepd), with net oil production up 22% to 93,000 bopd from 76,000 bopd in the prior year, primarily due to increased drilling activity and new plug and perf completion design. Natural gas and NGL production was also higher due to the increased drilling activity, additional natural gas captured with the start-up of the Little Missouri 4 natural gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2019 and additional NGL received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower NGL commodity pricing. During the year, we operated six rigs, drilled 160 wells and brought on production 156 wells. Effective 2019, all new production wells use plug and perf completions. We were able to reduce the average cost of a plug and perf well in 2019 to $6.8 million per well from $7.6 million in 2018.  

During 2020, we plan to operate six rigs, drill approximately 170 wells and bring approximately 175 wells on production. We forecast net production to average approximately 180,000 boepd in 2020 and to reach approximately 200,000 boepd by the end of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, the Tioga Gas Plant will be shut down for approximately 45 days for a planned turnaround and tie-in of the plant expansion project which will increase gas processing capacity to 400 million cubic feet per day from 250 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be in service by mid-2021. The shutdown for the turnaround is expected to reduce 2020 average net production, mostly natural gas liquids and natural gas, by approximately 6,000 boepd. Commencing in 2021, we plan to reduce our rig count to four operated rigs and, at this level of activity, expect to hold net production relatively flat at approximately 200,000 boepd for at least five years. 

•  

In the Gulf of Mexico, net production averaged 66,000 boepd (2018: 57,000 boepd). The increase in production was primarily due to the Conger and Penn State fields and a new well brought online at the Llano Field. We forecast Gulf of Mexico net production for 2020 to average approximately 65,000 boepd, which reflects the impact of planned maintenance at the Conger and Llano fields in the second quarter. 

In 2019, the Corporation announced a discovery at the Hess operated Esox-1 exploration well in Mississippi Canyon Block No. 726 (Hess 57%), which encountered approximately 191 feet of net pay in high-quality oil-bearing Miocene reservoirs. First production from the well was achieved in February 2020 as a tie-back to the Tubular Bells production facilities.  

During the fourth quarter of 2019, the operator, Kosmos Energy Ltd., commenced drilling of the Oldfield-1 exploration well (Hess 60%), located approximately 6 miles east of Esox-1. The well, which was completed in January 2020, did not encounter commercial quantities of hydrocarbons and 2019 results include $15 million in exploration expense for well costs incurred through December 31, 2019. We estimate approximately $15 million of exploration expense will be recognized in the first quarter of 2020 for well costs incurred after December 31, 2019. 

•  

At the Stabroek Block (Hess 30%), offshore Guyana, which covers approximately 6.6 million acres, the operator Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited has made sixteen significant discoveries since 2015. The discovered resources to date on the Stabroek Block are expected to underpin the potential for at least five FPSOs producing more than 750,000 gross bopd by 2025. 

The Liza Phase 1 development, which was sanctioned in 2017, began producing oil in December 2019 from the Liza Destiny FPSO. Production is expected to ramp up to the full capacity of 120,000 gross bopd in 2020. We forecast net production for 2020 to average approximately 25,000 bopd. 

The Liza Phase 2 development was sanctioned in 2019 and will utilize the Liza Unity FPSO to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd, with first production expected by early 2022. Six drill centers are planned with a total of 30 wells, including 15 production wells, nine water injection wells and six gas injection wells. In 2020, the operator plans to commence development drilling, installation of subsea flow lines and equipment, and installation of topside facilities modules on the Liza Unity FPSO.  

A third development, at the Payara Field, is expected to be sanctioned following government and regulatory approvals and is expected to produce up to 220,000 gross bopd with startup as early as 2023. In addition to the first three developments, planning is underway for additional FPSOs. The ultimate sizing and timing of these potential developments will be a function of further exploration and appraisal drilling. 

In 2019, five successful exploration wells and three successful appraisal wells were drilled on the Stabroek Block. See detailed well results on page 9 of Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties. 

•  

In the Gulf of Thailand, net production from Block A‑18 of the JDA averaged 35,000 boepd for the year (2018: 36,000 boepd), including contribution from unitized acreage in Malaysia, while net production from North Malay

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following is an update of significant Midstream activities during 2019: 

•  

In March, Hess Infrastructure Partners LP (HIP) completed the acquisition of Hess’ water services business for $225 million in cash. 

•  

In March, HIP and Hess Midstream Partners LP acquired crude oil and gas gathering assets, and HIP acquired water gathering assets of Summit Midstream Partners LP’s Tioga Gathering System for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $90 million, with the potential for an additional $10 million of contingent payments in future periods subject to certain future performance metrics. 

•  

The Little Missouri 4 gas processing plant, a 50/50 joint venture between Hess Midstream LP and Targa Resources Corp., was placed in service during the third quarter. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Liquidity and Capital and Exploratory Expenditures 

In 2019, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,642 million (2018: $1,939 million). At December 31, 2019, consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $1,545 million (2018: $2,694 million), consolidated debt was $7,142 million (2018: $6,672 million, including capital lease obligations), and our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio was 43.2% (2018: 38.0%). Hess Midstream debt, which is nonrecourse to Hess Corporation, was $1,753 million at December 31, 2019 (2018: $981 million). 

Capital and exploratory expenditures were as follows (in millions):

Consolidated Results of Operations 

Results by Segment: 

The after-tax income (loss) by major operating activity is summarized below: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Calculated as net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation less preferred stock dividends, divided by weighted average number of diluted shares. 

In the following discussion and elsewhere in this report, the financial effects of certain transactions are disclosed on an after-tax basis. Management reviews segment earnings on an after-tax basis and uses after-tax amounts in its review of variances in segment earnings. Management believes that after-tax amounts are a preferable method of explaining variances in earnings, since they show the entire effect of a transaction rather than only the pre-tax amount. After-tax amounts are determined by applying the income tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to pre-tax amounts. 

Items affecting comparability of earnings between periods: 

The following table summarizes items of income (expense) that are included in net income (loss) and affect comparability of earnings between periods. The items in the table below are explained on pages 36 through 39. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The following table presents the pre-tax amount of items affecting comparability of income (expense) by financial statement line item in the Statement of Consolidated Income on page 55. The items in the table below are explained on pages 36 through 39.

Reconciliations of GAAP and non-GAAP measures: 

The following table reconciles reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation and adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 The following table reconciles reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation is a non-GAAP financial measure, which we define as reported net income (loss) attributable to Hess Corporation excluding items identified as affecting comparability of earnings between periods, which are summarized on pages 36 through 39. Management uses adjusted net income (loss) to evaluate the Corporation’s operating performance and believes that investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes certain items that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and are not indicative of future business trends and operations.  

Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities presented in this report is a non-GAAP measure, which we define as reported net cash provided by (used in) operating activities excluding changes in operating assets and liabilities. Management uses net cash provided by (used in) operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities to evaluate the Corporation’s ability to internally fund capital expenditures, pay dividends and service debt and believes that investors’ understanding of our ability to generate cash to fund these items is enhanced by disclosing this measure, which excludes working capital and other movements that may distort assessment of our performance between periods. 

These measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income (loss) and net cash provided by (used in) operating activities.

Comparison of Results 

Exploration and Production 

Following is a summarized statement of income for our E&P operations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. See footnote (a) in the table on page 86 for further details. 

Excluding the E&P items affecting comparability of earnings between periods in the table on page 36, the changes in E&P results are primarily attributable to changes in selling prices, production and sales volumes, marketing expenses, cash operating costs, Midstream tariffs, depreciation, depletion and amortization, exploration expenses and income taxes, as discussed below. 

32 

Selling Prices: Average worldwide realized crude oil selling prices, including hedging, were 7% lower in 2019 compared with the prior year, primarily due to the decrease in Brent and WTI crude oil prices. In addition, realized worldwide selling prices for NGL decreased in 2019 by 39% and worldwide natural gas prices decreased in 2019 by 7%, compared with the prior year. In total, lower realized selling prices decreased 2019 financial results by approximately $380 million after income taxes, compared with 2018. Our average selling prices were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Selling prices in the United States are adjusted for certain processing and distribution fees included in Marketing expenses. Excluding these fees Worldwide selling prices for 2019 would be $59.95 per barrel for crude oil (including hedging) (2018: $63.77), $59.94 per barrel for crude oil (excluding hedging) (2018: $66.80), $13.40 per barrel for NGL (2018: $22.00) and $3.97 per mcf for natural gas (2018: $4.25). 

Crude oil hedging activities were a net gain of $1 million before and after income taxes in 2019, and a loss of $183 million before and after income taxes in 2018. For calendar year 2020, we have WTI put options with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. We expect noncash put option premium amortization, which will be reflected in realized selling prices, to reduce our 2020 results by approximately $70 million per quarter. 

33 

Production Volumes: Our daily worldwide net production was as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

The Corporation sold its Utica assets in August 2018. Production was 9,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 19,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Corporation sold its Permian assets in August 2017. Production was 4,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017.  

(b)  

The Corporation sold its Norway assets in December 2017. Production was 24,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

(c)  

The Corporation sold its Equatorial Guinea assets in November 2017. Production was 25,000 boepd for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

In 2020, we expect net production, excluding Libya, to average between 330,000 boepd and 335,000 boepd, compared with 2019 net production, excluding Libya, of 290,000 boepd.  

Net production variances related to 2019 and 2018 are summarized as follows: 

United States: Bakken net oil production was higher in 2019, primarily due to increased drilling activity and new plug and perf completion design. Bakken net natural gas and NGL production was higher in 2019 also due to the increased drilling activity, additional natural gas captured with the start-up of the Little Missouri 4 natural gas processing plant in the third quarter of 2019 and additional NGL received under percentage of proceeds contracts resulting from lower NGL commodity pricing. The decline in U.S. other onshore net production from 2018 reflects the sale of our interests in the Utica shale play in August 2018. U.S. offshore net production increased in 2019, primarily due to higher production from the Conger and Penn State fields and a new well brought online at the Llano Field. 

International: In Europe, Africa and Asia, net production was comparable in 2019 with 2018. 

34 

Sales Volumes: The impact of higher sales volumes from our net production improved after-tax results by approximately $560 million in 2019, compared with 2018.  

Net worldwide sales volumes from Hess net production, which excludes sales volumes of crude oil, NGL and natural gas purchased from third parties, were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Marketing, including purchased oil and gas (Marketing expense): Marketing expense is mainly comprised of costs to purchase crude oil, NGL and natural gas from our partners in Hess operated wells or other third parties, primarily in the U.S., and transportation and other distribution costs for U.S. marketing activities. Marketing expense for 2019 is comparable to 2018 primarily due to lower benchmark crude oil prices on the cost of purchased volumes being largely offset by higher purchases of third-party volumes. 

Cash Operating Costs: Cash operating costs, consisting of operating costs and expenses, production and severance taxes and E&P general and administrative expenses, decreased $11 million in 2019, compared to 2018. Cash operating costs in 2018 included pre-tax charges totaling $91 million for vacated office space and severance costs, which more than offset increased costs from higher production in 2019. On a per-unit basis, cash operating costs improved from 2018 reflecting higher net production volumes in 2019. See Exit Costs and Other in Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods on page 37.  

Midstream Tariffs Expense: Tariffs expense increased from 2018, primarily due to higher throughput volumes in 2019. In 2020, we estimate Midstream tariffs expense to be in the range of $940 million to $965 million.  

Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A): DD&A costs increased by $229 million from 2018 primarily due to higher net production volumes in the Bakken and Gulf of Mexico.  

Unit costs: Unit cost per boe information is based on total E&P production volumes and excludes items affecting comparability of earnings as disclosed below. Actual and forecast unit costs are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Forecast information excludes any contribution from Libya. 

(b)  

Cash operating costs per boe, excluding Libya, was $12.54 in 2019 (2018: $13.32).  

(c)  

DD&A per boe, excluding Libya, was $18.52 in 2019 (2018: $18.29). 

Exploration Expenses: Exploration expenses, including items affecting comparability of earnings described below, were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2019, dry hole costs primarily related to the Jill-1 well on License 6/16 in Denmark and the Oldfield-1 well in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2018, dry hole costs primarily related to the Aspy well, offshore Nova Scotia, Canada; the Pontoenoe-1 well, offshore Suriname and the Sorubim-1 well on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana. In 2020, we estimate exploration expenses, excluding dry hole expense, to be in the range of $210 million to $220 million. 

35 

Income Taxes: In 2019, income tax expense was $375 million (2018: $391 million), primarily related to our operations in Libya. Commencing in 2017, we are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only), Malaysia and Guyana (until December 2019), while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions in accordance with the requirements of U.S. accounting standards. At December 31, 2019 the valuation allowance established against the net deferred tax asset in Guyana for the Stabroek Block was released as a result of the positive evidence from first production in December 2019, and the significant forecasted pre-tax income from operations. The cumulative pre-tax losses in Guyana were driven by pre-production activities. See E&P items affecting comparability of earnings below. 

Actual effective tax rates are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Excludes any contribution from Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings. 

In 2020, we estimate income tax expense, excluding Libya and items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, to be in the range of $80 million to $90 million. 

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Reported E&P earnings include the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The pre-tax amounts of E&P items affecting comparability of income (expense) as presented in the Statement of Consolidated Income are as follows:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

2019: 

•  

Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our remaining acreage in the Utica shale play. 

•  

Cost recovery settlement: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $21 million ($19 million after income taxes) related to a settlement on historical cost recovery balances in the JDA that was paid in cash. 

•  

Reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowance: We recorded a noncash income tax benefit of $60 million, which resulted from the reversal of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets in Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development. 

36 

2018: 

•  

Gains (losses) on asset sales, net: We recorded a pre-tax gain of $14 million ($14 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our joint venture interests in the Utica shale play in eastern Ohio and a pre-tax gain of $10 million ($10 million after income taxes) associated with the sale of our interests in Ghana. 

•  

Exit costs and other: We incurred noncash pre-tax charges of $73 million ($73 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space. In addition, we recorded a pre-tax severance charge of $37 million ($37 million after income taxes), related to a cost reduction program undertaken to reflect the reduced scale of our business following significant asset sales in 2017. 

2017: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Impairment: We recorded a noncash impairment charge related to our interests in Norway totaling $2,503 million pre-tax ($550 million after income taxes) in the third quarter prior to the sale of our interests in the fourth quarter. In addition, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of our interests in the Stampede Field by $1,095 million ($1,095 million after income taxes), and the Tubular Bells Field by $605 million ($605 million after income taxes) primarily because of a lower long-term crude oil price outlook. The Stampede Field had significant capitalized exploration and appraisal costs that were incurred on a 100% working interest basis on the Pony discovery prior to unitizing into the Stampede project. See Note 13, Impairment in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

•  

Dry hole, lease impairment and other exploration expenses: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $280 million ($280 million after income taxes) to fully impair the carrying value of our interest at the Hess operated offshore Deepwater Tano/Cape Three Points license, offshore Ghana (Hess 50% license interest) as a result of management’s decision in the fourth quarter of 2017 to not develop the previously discovered fields. These costs were incurred in periods prior to 2017. 

•  

Noncash charges on de-designated crude oil collars: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $22 million ($22 million after income taxes) related to certain crude oil collars not designated as cash flow hedges. The de-designation was a result of production downtime caused by a fire at the third-party operated Enchilada platform in the Gulf of Mexico during the fourth quarter. 

37 

Midstream 

Following is a summarized statement of income for our Midstream operations: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Commencing January 1, 2019, management changed its measurement of segment earnings to reflect income taxes on a post U.S. tax consolidation and valuation allowance assessment basis. See footnote (a) in the table on page 86 for further details. 

Sales and other operating revenues increased from 2018 primarily due to higher throughput volumes, increased rail transportation and water trucking revenues associated with third-party services, and higher tariff rates. 

Operating costs and expenses increased from 2018, primarily due to higher maintenance activity, and increased third party rail transportation and water trucking charges. General and administrative expenses increased in 2019, compared to 2018, as a result of expenditures incurred from Hess Midstream Partners LP’s acquisition of HIP and its corporate restructuring. See Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods below. DD&A expenses increased from 2018 primarily due to additional assets places in service, including those related to the Summit acquisition.  

The increase in interest expense from 2018 reflects higher borrowings by the Midstream business. 

In 2020, we estimate net income attributable to Hess Corporation from the Midstream segment to be in the range of $205 million to $215 million.  

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: In 2019, we recognized a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($16 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) for transaction related costs for Hess Midstream Partners LP’s acquisition of HIP and associated corporate restructuring. See Note 6, Hess Midstream in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In 2017, we recognized a pre-tax loss of $57 million ($34 million after income taxes and noncontrolling interests) related to the sale of our Midstream assets in the Permian Basin. 

38 

Corporate, Interest and Other 

The following table summarizes Corporate, Interest and Other expenses: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, increased from 2018 primarily due to lower interest income and a reduction in other non-operating income. In 2020, after-tax Corporate and other expenses, excluding items affecting comparability of earnings between periods, are estimated to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million.  

Interest expense for 2019 is comparable to 2018. Capitalized interest increased from 2018 due to ongoing development activity in Guyana, including the sanction of the Liza Field Phase 2 development during 2019. In 2020, after-tax interest expense, net is estimated to be in the range of $350 million to $360 million. The estimated increase in 2020 is due to ceasing interest capitalization at the Liza Field, which commenced production in December 2019. 

Items Affecting Comparability of Earnings Between Periods: Corporate, Interest and Other results included the following items affecting comparability of income (expense) before and after income taxes: 

2019: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Income tax:  We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax expense of $86 million that was previously a component of accumulated other comprehensive income related to our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts. 

2018: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $58 million ($58 million after income taxes) resulting from the settlement of legal claims related to former downstream interests. 

•  

Income tax:  We recorded an allocation of noncash income tax benefit of $91 million to offset the recognition of a noncash income tax expense recorded in other comprehensive income resulting primarily from changes in fair value of our 2019 crude oil hedge contracts. 

2017: 

•  

Exit costs and other: We recorded a pre-tax charge of $30 million ($30 million after income taxes) in connection with vacated office space, of which $11 million is included in General and administrative expenses and $19 million is included in Depreciation, depletion and amortization in the Statement of Consolidated Income. 

39 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows 

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Operating Activities: Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,642 million in 2019 (2018: $1,939 million), while net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities was $2,237 million in 2019 (2018: $2,129 million). Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased from 2018 primarily due to higher net production volumes, partially offset by lower commodity prices. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2019 reduced net cash provided by operating activities by $595 million (2018: $190 million reduction), primarily from premiums paid on crude oil hedge contracts, abandonment expenditures, pension contributions and an increase in accounts receivable. Changes in operating assets and liabilities in 2018 primarily related to premiums on crude oil hedge contracts and abandonment expenditures. 

Investing Activities: Total Additions to Property, Plant and Equipment were $2,829 million in 2019 (2018: $2,097 million). The increase in Additions to property, plant and equipment from 2018 is primarily related to increased drilling activity in the Bakken, increased exploration and development activity on the Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, and the Midstream operating segment’s acquisition of assets from Summit Midstream Partners LP. In 2019, Midstream equity investments in its 50/50 joint venture with Targa Resources were $33 million (2018: $67 million). Proceeds from asset sales were $22 million in 2019 (2018: $607 million; 2017: $3,296 million). See Note 3, Dispositions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Financing Activities: Repayments of debt were $8 million in 2019 (2018: $633 million) while borrowings with maturities in excess of 90 days of $760 million in 2019 related to our Midstream operating segment. Common and preferred stock dividends paid were $316 million in 2019 (2018: $345 million). We settled $25 million of common stock purchases in 2019 (2018: $1,365 million). Net cash outflows to noncontrolling interests were $353 million in 2019 (2018: $211 million). 

Future Capital Requirements and Resources 

At December 31, 2019, Hess Corporation, had $1.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, excluding Midstream, and total liquidity, including available committed credit facilities, of approximately $5.4 billion. The Corporation has no significant near-term debt maturities. Currently, we have WTI put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $55 per barrel for 130,000 bopd, and Brent put options for calendar year 2020 with an average monthly floor price of $60 per barrel for 20,000 bopd. 

Net production in 2020 is forecast to be in the range of 330,000 boepd to 335,000 boepd, excluding Libya, and we expect our 2020 E&P capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $3.0 billion. In 2020, based on current forward strip crude oil prices, we expect cash flow from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents existing at December 31, 2019, and our available committed revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our capital investment program and dividends.

The table below summarizes the capacity, usage, and available capacity of our borrowing and letter of credit facilities at December 31, 2019: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

Committed and uncommitted lines have expiration dates throughout 2020. 

(b)  

This credit facility may only be utilized by HESM Opco and is non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 

Hess Corporation: 

In 2019, the Corporation entered into a new $3.5 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity date of May 15, 2023, which replaced the Corporation’s previous revolving credit facility that was scheduled to mature on January 21, 2021. The new facility, which is fully undrawn, can be used for borrowings and letters of credit. Borrowings on the new facility will generally bear interest at 1.30% above LIBOR, though the interest rate is subject to adjustment if the Corporation’s credit rating changes. The facility is subject to customary representations, warranties and covenants, including a financial covenant limiting the ratio of Total Consolidated Debt to Total Capitalization (as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the facility) of the Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries to 65%, and customary events of default. At December 31, 2019, the Corporation was in compliance with its financial covenants. 

We had $272 million in letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 2019 (2018: $284 million), which primarily relate to our international operations. See also Note 19, Financial Risk Management Activities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

We have a shelf registration under which we may issue additional debt securities, warrants, common stock or preferred stock. 

Midstream: 

At December 31, 2019, Hess Midstream Operations LP (formerly Hess Midstream Partners LP, or HESM Opco), a consolidated subsidiary of Hess Midstream LP, had $1.4 billion of senior secured syndicated credit facilities maturing December 16, 2024, consisting of a $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400 million 5-year Term Loan A facility. The revolving credit facility can be used for borrowings and letters of credit to fund HESM Opco’s operating activities, capital expenditures, distributions and for other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the 5-year Term Loan A facility will generally bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from 1.55% to 2.50%, while the applicable margin for the 5-year syndicated revolving credit facility ranges from 1.275% to 2.000%. Pricing levels for the facility fee and interest-rate margins are based on HESM Opco’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities). If HESM Opco obtains an investment grade credit rating, the pricing levels will be based on HESM Opco’s credit ratings in effect from time to time. The credit facilities contain covenants that require HESM Opco to maintain a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (as defined in the credit facilities) for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 5.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter (5.50 to 1.00 during the specified period following certain acquisitions) and, prior to HESM Opco obtaining an investment grade credit rating, a ratio of secured debt to EBITDA for the prior four fiscal quarters of not greater than 4.00 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter. HESM Opco was in compliance with these financial covenants at December 31, 2019. The credit facilities are secured by first-priority perfected liens on substantially all the presently owned and after-acquired assets of HESM Opco and its direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries, including equity interests directly owned by such entities, subject to certain customary exclusions. At December 31, 2019, borrowings of $32 million were drawn under HESM Opco’s revolving credit facility, and borrowings of $400 million, excluding deferred issuance costs, were drawn under HESM Opco’s Term Loan A facility. Borrowings under these credit facilities are non-recourse to Hess Corporation. 

41 

Credit Ratings 

Two of the three major credit rating agencies that rate the Corporation’s debt have assigned an investment grade rating. At December 31, 2019, we have investment grade credit ratings from Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services (BBB-) and Fitch Ratings (BBB-). Moody’s Investors Service has rated our debt at Ba1. The consequence of lower credit ratings is an increase in interest rates and facility fees on our credit facilities, and the potential for additional required collateral under operating agreements, which are not material at December 31, 2019. 

At December 31, 2019, HESM Opco’s senior unsecured debt is rated BB+ by Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings, and Ba3 by Moody’s Investors Service. 

Contractual Obligations and Contingencies 

The following table shows aggregate information about certain contractual obligations at December 31, 2019: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(a)  

We anticipate cash payments for interest on Total Debt of $422 million for 2020, $831 million for 2021-2022, $817 million for 2023-2024, and $3,640 million thereafter for a total of $5,710 million. These interest payments reflect our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019. 

(b)  

Comprises obligations, including where we, as operator, have contracted directly with suppliers. 

Capital expenditures represent amounts that we were contractually committed at December 31, 2019, including the portion of our planned capital expenditure program for 2020. Obligations for operating expenses include commitments for oil and gas production expenses, seismic purchases and other normal business expenses. Other liabilities reflect contractually committed obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2019, including pension plan liabilities and estimates for uncertain income tax positions. The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries primarily lease drilling rigs, equipment, logistical assets (offshore vessels, aircraft, and shorebases), and office space for varying periods. See Note 7, Leases in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

At December 31, 2019, we had $272 million in letters of credit. See also Note 17, Guarantees, Contingencies and Commitments in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Foreign Operations 

We conduct E&P activities outside the U.S., principally in Guyana, the Joint Development Area of Malaysia/Thailand and Malaysia, Denmark, Libya, Suriname, and Canada. Therefore, we are subject to the risks associated with foreign operations, including political risk, tax law changes, currency risk, corruption, and acts of terrorism. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for further details.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

Accounting policies and estimates affect the recognition of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and revenues and expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Income. The accounting methods used can affect net income, equity and various financial statement ratios. However, our accounting policies generally do not change cash flows or liquidity. 

Accounting for Exploration and Development Costs: E&P activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method. Costs of acquiring unproved and proved oil and gas leasehold acreage, including lease bonuses, brokers’ fees and other related costs are capitalized. Annual lease rentals, exploration expenses and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred. Costs of drilling and equipping productive wells, including development dry holes, and related production facilities are capitalized. 

The costs of exploratory wells that find oil and gas reserves are capitalized pending determination of whether proved reserves have been found. Exploratory drilling costs remain capitalized after drilling is completed if (1) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well and (2) sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operational viability of the project. If either of those criteria is not met, or if there is substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the capitalized well costs are charged to expense. Indicators of sufficient progress in assessing reserves, and the economic and operating viability of a project include: commitment of project personnel, active negotiations for sales contracts with customers, negotiations with governments, operators and contractors and firm plans for additional drilling and other factors. 

Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves: The determination of estimated proved reserves is a significant element in arriving at the results of operations of E&P activities. The estimates of proved reserves affect well capitalizations, the unit of production depreciation rates of proved properties and wells and equipment, as well as impairment testing of oil and gas assets. 

For reserves to be booked as proved they must be determined with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. In addition, government and project operator approvals must be obtained and, depending on the amount of the project cost, senior management or the Board of Directors must commit to fund the project. We maintain our own internal reserve estimates that are calculated by technical staff that work directly with the oil and gas properties. Our technical staff update reserve estimates throughout the year based on evaluations of new wells, performance reviews, new technical data and other studies. To provide consistency throughout the Corporation, standard reserve estimation guidelines, definitions, reporting reviews and approval practices are used. The internal reserve estimates are subject to internal technical audits and senior management review. We also engage an independent third-party consulting firm to audit approximately 80% of our total proved reserves each year. 

Proved reserves are calculated using the average price during the twelve-month period ending December 31 determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the price on the first day of each month within the year, unless prices are defined by contractual agreements, excluding escalations based on future conditions. As discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors, crude oil prices are volatile which can have an impact on our proved reserves. If crude oil prices in 2020 are at levels below that used in determining 2019 proved reserves, we may recognize negative revisions to our December 31, 2020 proved undeveloped reserves. In addition, we may recognize negative revisions to proved developed reserves, which can vary significantly by asset due to differing operating cost structures. Conversely, price increases in 2020 above those used in determining 2019 proved reserves could result in positive revisions to proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020. It is difficult to estimate the magnitude of any potential net negative or positive change in proved reserves at December 31, 2020, due to numerous currently unknown factors, including 2020 crude oil prices, any revisions based on 2020 reservoir performance, and the levels to which industry costs will change in response to movements in commodity prices. A 10% change in proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2019 would result in an approximate $200 million pre-tax change in depreciation, depletion, and amortization expense for 2020 based on projected production volumes. See the Supplementary Oil and Gas Data on pages 90 through 98 in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our oil and gas reserves. 

Impairment of Long-lived Assets: We review long‑lived assets, including oil and gas fields, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recovered. Long‑lived assets are tested based on identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets are not expected to be recovered by estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, the assets are impaired and an impairment loss is recorded. The amount of impairment is determined based on the estimated fair value of the assets generally determined by discounting anticipated future net cash flows, an income valuation approach, or by a market‑based valuation approach, which are Level 3 fair value measurements. 

In the case of oil and gas fields, the present value of future net cash flows is based on management’s best estimate of future prices, which is determined with reference to recent historical prices and published forward prices, applied to projected production volumes and discounted at a risk-adjusted rate. The projected production volumes represent reserves, including probable reserves, expected to be produced based on a stipulated amount of capital expenditures. The production volumes,  

43 

prices and timing of production are consistent with internal projections and other externally reported information. Oil and gas prices used for determining asset impairment will generally differ from those used in the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, since the standardized measure requires the use of historical twelve-month average prices.  

Our impairment tests of long-lived E&P producing assets are based on our best estimates of future production volumes (including recovery factors), selling prices, operating and capital costs, the timing of future production and other factors, which are updated each time an impairment test is performed. While crude oil prices in 2019 were lower than last year, we could experience an asset impairment in the future if the projected production volumes from oil and gas fields decrease, crude oil and natural gas selling prices decline significantly for an extended period or future estimated capital and operating costs increase significantly. 

Midstream Joint Venture:  We consolidate the activities of our interest in Hess Midstream LP, which qualifies as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, as defined in the accounting standards, since we have the power through Hess Corporation’s 47% consolidated ownership interest in Hess Midstream LP to direct those activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of Hess Midstream LP, and are obligated to absorb losses or have the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to Hess Midstream LP. This conclusion was based on a qualitative analysis that considered Hess Midstream LP’s governance structure, the commercial agreements between Hess Midstream LP and us, and the voting rights established between the members, which provide us the ability to control the operations of Hess Midstream LP. 

Income Taxes: Judgments are required in the determination and recognition of income tax assets and liabilities in the financial statements. These judgments include the requirement to recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position only when management believes it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. 

We have net operating loss carryforwards or credit carryforwards in multiple jurisdictions and have recorded deferred tax assets for those losses and credits. Additionally, we have deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities. Regular assessments are made as to the likelihood of those deferred tax assets being realized. If, when tested under the relevant accounting standards, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized.  

The accounting standards require the evaluation of all available positive and negative evidence giving weight based on the evidence’s relative objectivity. In evaluating potential sources of positive evidence, we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences, taxable income in carryback and carryforward periods, the availability of tax planning strategies, the existence of appreciated assets, estimates of future taxable income, and other factors. Estimates of future taxable income are based on assumptions of oil and gas reserves, selling prices, and other subjective operating assumptions that are consistent with internal business forecasts. In evaluating potential sources of negative evidence, we consider a cumulative loss in recent years, any history of operating losses or tax credit carryforwards expiring unused, losses expected in early future years, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and profit levels on a continuing basis in future years, and any carryback or carryforward period so brief that a significant deductible temporary difference expected to reverse in a single year would limit realization of tax benefits. Due to a sustained low commodity price environment, we remained in a three-year cumulative consolidated loss position at December 31, 2019. A three-year cumulative consolidated loss constitutes objective negative evidence to which the accounting standards require we assign significant weight relative to subjective evidence such as our estimates of future taxable income. We are generally not recognizing deferred tax benefit or expense in certain countries, primarily the U.S., Denmark (hydrocarbon tax only) and Malaysia while we maintain valuation allowances against net deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions. In December 2019, we reversed the valuation allowance of $60 million for Guyana upon achieving first production from the Liza Phase 1 development. 

At December 31, 2019, the Consolidated Balance Sheet reflects a $4,734 million valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets for multiple jurisdictions based on the evaluation of the accounting standards described above. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income change or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight is given to subjective evidence such as expected future growth.  

Asset Retirement Obligations: We have material legal obligations to remove and dismantle long‑lived assets and to restore land or seabed at certain E&P locations. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations. In addition, the fair value of any legally required conditional asset retirement obligation is recorded if the liability can be reasonably estimated. We capitalize such costs as a component of the carrying amount of the underlying assets in the period in which the liability is incurred. In subsequent periods, the liability is accreted, and the asset is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset. We estimate the fair value of these obligations by discounting projected future payments that will be required to satisfy the obligations. In determining these estimates, we are  

44 

required to make several assumptions and judgments related to the scope of dismantlement, timing of settlement, interpretation of legal requirements, inflationary factors and discount rate. In addition, there are other external factors, which could significantly affect the ultimate settlement costs or timing for these obligations including changes in environmental regulations and other statutory requirements, fluctuations in industry costs and foreign currency exchange rates and advances in technology. As a result, our estimates of asset retirement obligations are subject to revision due to the factors described above. Changes in estimates prior to settlement result in adjustments to both the liability and related asset values, unless the field has ceased production, in which case changes are recognized in our Consolidated Statement of Income. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations. 

Retirement Plans: We have funded non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, an unfunded supplemental pension plan and an unfunded postretirement medical plan. We recognize the net change in the funded status of the projected benefit obligation for these plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The determination of the obligations and expenses related to these plans are based on several actuarial assumptions. These assumptions represent estimates made by us, some of which can be affected by external factors. The most significant assumptions relate to: 

Discount rate used for measuring the present value of future plan obligations: The discount rate used to estimate our projected benefit obligations is based on a portfolio of high‑quality, fixed income debt instruments with maturities that approximate the expected payment of plan obligations. At December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase projected benefit obligations by approximately $120 million and forecasted 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $10 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligations would decrease the funded status of our pension plans, but any decrease in the funded status would be partially mitigated by increases in the fair value of fixed income investments in the asset portfolios. 

Expected long-term rates of returns on plan assets: The expected return on plan assets is developed from the expected future returns for each asset category, weighted by the target allocation of pension assets to that asset category. The future expected return assumptions for individual asset categories are largely based on inputs from various investment experts regarding their future return expectations for particular asset categories. At December 31, 2019, a 0.25% decrease in the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets assumption would increase forecasted 2020 annual benefit expense by approximately $5 million.  

Other assumptions include the rate of future increases in compensation levels and participant mortality level. 

Derivatives: We utilize derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options and swaps, individually or in combination to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and natural gas, as well as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates. All derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our policy for recognizing the changes in fair value of derivatives varies based on the designation of the derivative. The changes in fair value of derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recognized currently in earnings. Derivatives may be designated as hedges of expected future cash flows or forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges), or hedges of changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities or of unrecognized firm commitments (fair value hedges). Changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for cash flow hedges are reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recognized currently in earnings. The change in fair value of the related hedged commitment is recorded as an adjustment to its carrying amount and recognized currently in earnings. 

Fair Value Measurements: We use various valuation approaches in determining fair value for financial instruments, including the market and income approaches. Our fair value measurements also include non-performance risk and time value of money considerations. Counterparty credit is considered for receivable balances, and our credit is considered for accrued liabilities. 

We also record certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value when required by generally accepted accounting principles. These fair value measurements are recorded in connection with business combinations, qualifying non-monetary exchanges, the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations and any impairment of long-lived assets, equity method investments or goodwill. 

We determine fair value in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting standard which established a hierarchy for the inputs used to measure fair value based on the source of the inputs, which generally range from quoted prices for identical instruments in a principal trading market (Level 1) to estimates determined using related market data (Level 3), including discounted cash flows and other unobservable data. Measurements derived indirectly from observable inputs or from quoted prices from markets that are less liquid are considered Level 2. When Level 1 inputs are available within a particular market, those inputs are selected for determination of fair value over Level 2 or 3 inputs in the same market. Multiple inputs  

45 

may be used to measure fair value; however, the level of fair value assigned for each physical derivative and financial asset or liability is based on the lowest significant input level within this fair value hierarchy.  

Environment, Health and Safety 

Our long-term vision and values provide a foundation for how we do business and define our commitment to meeting high standards of corporate citizenship and creating a long lasting positive impact on the communities where we do business. Our strategy is reflected in our environment, health, safety and social responsibility (EHS & SR) policies and by a management system framework that helps protect our workforce, customers and local communities. Our management systems are intended to promote internal consistency, adherence to policy objectives and continual improvement in EHS & SR performance. Improved performance may, in the short‑term, increase our operating costs and could also require increased capital expenditures to reduce potential risks to our assets, reputation and license to operate. In addition to enhanced EHS & SR performance, improved productivity and operational efficiencies may be realized from investments in EHS & SR. We have programs in place to evaluate regulatory compliance, audit facilities, train employees, prevent and manage risks and emergencies and to generally meet corporate EHS & SR goals and objectives. 

We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. We assess, monitor and take measures to reduce our carbon footprint at existing and planned operations. We are committed to complying with all Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions regulations and the responsible management of GHG emissions at our facilities. 

We will have continuing expenditures for environmental assessment and remediation. Sites where corrective action may be necessary include E&P facilities, sites from discontinued operations where we retained liability and, although not currently significant, “Superfund” sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party. 

We accrue for environmental assessment and remediation expenses when the future costs are probable and reasonably estimable. At December 31, 2019, our reserve for estimated remediation liabilities was approximately $70 million. We expect that existing reserves for environmental liabilities will adequately cover costs to assess and remediate known sites. Our remediation spending was approximately $20 million in 2019 (2018: $15 million; 2017: $15 million). The amount of other expenditures incurred to comply with federal, state, local and foreign country environmental regulations is difficult to quantify as such costs are captured as mostly indistinguishable components of our capital expenditures and operating expenses.
