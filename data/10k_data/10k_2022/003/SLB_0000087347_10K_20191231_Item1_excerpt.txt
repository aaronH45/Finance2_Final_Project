APS creates alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator whereby Schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation. These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customer assets under long-term agreements. Schlumberger invests its own services and products, and historically, cash in certain cases, into the field development activities and operations. Although in certain arrangements Schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides, generally Schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products. Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a fee-per-barrel basis. This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline. APS represented less than 5% of Schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.

GENERAL  

Intellectual Property  

Schlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger’s business. While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to Schlumberger’s business.  

Seasonality  

Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other oilfield services and products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. Conversely, customer budget constraints may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of each year.  

Customers and Backlog of Orders  

For the year ended December 31, 2019, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Other than the OneSubsea, Drilling Systems and WesternGeco businesses, Schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses. The combined backlog of these businesses was $3.0 billion at December 31, 2019 (of which approximately 50% is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2020) and $2.7 billion at December 31, 2018.
