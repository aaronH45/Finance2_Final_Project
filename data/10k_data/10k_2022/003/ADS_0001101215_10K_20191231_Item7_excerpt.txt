Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

​

Overview

​

We are a leading global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions serving large, consumer-based industries. We create and deploy customized solutions, enhancing the critical customer marketing experience and measurably changing consumer behavior while driving business growth and profitability for some of today’s most recognizable brands. We help our clients create and increase customer loyalty through solutions that engage millions of customers each day across multiple touch points using traditional, digital, mobile and emerging technologies. We operate under two segments—LoyaltyOne and Card Services. Our LoyaltyOne business owns and operates the AIR MILES Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty, a global provider of tailor-made loyalty programs for grocers. Our Card Services business is a provider of private label, co-brand, and business credit card programs. Effective March 31, 2019, our Epsilon segment was treated as a discontinued operation, and was subsequently sold on July 1, 2019.

​

Year in Review

​

While our financial results did not meet original expectations, we made several strategic changes and achieved certain objectives during the year ended December 31, 2019.

​

Organizational Changes

​

On June 5, 2019, the Board of Directors of Alliance Data appointed Melisa A. Miller, who led Alliance Data’s Card Services business, as Alliance Data’s President and Chief Executive Officer as well as a Director of the Company. She succeeded Ed Heffernan who announced his resignation as President and Chief Executive Officer and as a Director of the Company. 

​

On November 18, 2019, we announced that Ralph Andretta had been selected Alliance Data’s President and Chief Executive Officer as well as a Director of the Company, which appointment became effective February 3, 2020. Melisa Miller stepped down from those positions in November 2019 but continued to serve the Company in an advisory capacity through February 16, 2020. Charles Horn, Executive Vice President, served as acting Chief Executive Officer until the effective date of Mr. Andretta’s appointment and will continue to focus his attention on international operations, operating efficiencies and strategic initiatives. 

​

Additionally, during 2019, executive management and the Board of Directors evaluated the cost structure and potential cost saving initiatives throughout the organization. As a result, we incurred $118.1 million in restructuring and other charges in 2019 to streamline our cost structure, as described in more detail in Note 14, “Restructuring and Other Charges,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

Capital Transactions

​

On July 1, 2019, we sold our former Epsilon segment to Publicis Groupe S.A. for $4.4 billion in cash. We incurred approximately $79.0 million in transaction costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 and recorded a $512.2 million pre-tax gain ($252.1 million after-tax loss) on sale.

​

In July 2019, proceeds from the sale of Epsilon were used to extinguish all of our outstanding senior notes of $1.9 billion and to make a mandatory payment of $500.0 million on our revolving credit facility, which reduced available credit commitments in the same amount. 

​

During 2019, we repurchased approximately 6.3 million shares of our common stock for aggregate consideration of $976.1 million and paid dividends and dividend equivalent rights of $127.4 million. 

​

During 2019, we purchased four credit card portfolios for aggregate cash consideration of $924.8 million and sold 13 credit card portfolios for aggregate cash consideration of $2,061.8 million.

​

In December 2019, we issued and sold $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due December 15, 2024. The net proceeds of $833.0 million were used to make a prepayment of our term debt under the credit agreement. We also amended our credit agreement, extending the maturity date from June 14, 2021 to December 31, 2022. As amended, our credit agreement provides for a $2,028.8 million term loan and a $750.0 million revolving line of credit.

​

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018

​

Revenue. Total revenue decreased $85.3 million, or 2%, to $5,581.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $5,666.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net decrease was due to the following:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

●Redemption. Revenue decreased $39.0 million, or 6%, to $637.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Redemption revenue from our coalition loyalty program decreased $46.4 million due to the net presentation of $43.0 million of revenue from the outsourcing of additional rewards inventory during the year ended December 31, 2019. Redemption revenue from our short-term loyalty programs increased $7.4 million due to strong performance in Europe, Asia and Brazil, offset in part by the decline in the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar.

●Finance charges, net. Revenue increased $33.6 million, or 1%, to $4,728.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by a 1% increase in normalized average receivables, which includes receivables held for sale that increased revenue by $53.3 million, offset in part by an approximate 10 basis point decrease in finance charge yield, which decreased revenue by $19.7 million.

​

31 
Cost of operations. Cost of operations increased $150.6 million, or 6%, to $2,687.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $2,537.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase was due to the following:

●Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations increased $23.4 million due primarily to $50.8 million of restructuring and other charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 14, “Restructuring and Other Charges,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Additionally, data processing expense increased $21.2 million driven by an increase in outsourced technology costs. These increases were offset in part by the net presentation of $43.0 million in cost of redemptions within our coalition loyalty program as discussed in revenue above.

●Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations increased $127.2 million due primarily to an $88.1 million increase in valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card receivables held for sale and $29.4 million of restructuring and other charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 14, “Restructuring and Other Charges,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

Provision for loan loss. Provision for loan loss increased $171.5 million, or 17%, to $1,187.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $1,016.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as principal loss rates stabilized in 2019 as compared to improved in 2018. Additionally, end of period credit card and loan receivables increased in the current year as compared to the prior year. 

​

General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $11.9 million, or 7%, to $150.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $162.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by cost saving initiatives implemented in the first half of 2019, which among other items included reduced headcount, office space, charitable contributions and overall corporate overhead costs. These declines were offset in part by the $37.9 million in restructuring costs and $10.7 million in strategic transaction costs incurred in the current year. See Note 14, “Restructuring and Other Charges,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization decreased $0.8 million, or 1%, to $79.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to certain fully depreciated property and equipment at LoyaltyOne, offset in part by additional assets placed into service from recent capital expenditures.

​

Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $16.7 million, or 15%, to $96.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $112.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets, including portfolio premiums and customer contracts.

​

Loss on extinguishment of debt. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a $71.9 million loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the $49.9 million redemption price of the senior notes and the write-off of $22.0 million deferred issuance costs related to the July 2019 early extinguishment of $1.9 billion outstanding senior notes and the amendment to the credit agreement, which was effective upon the consummation of the sale of Epsilon.

​

Interest expense, net. Total interest expense, net increased $26.7 million, or 5%, to $569.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $542.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net increase was due to the following:

●Securitization funding costs. Securitization funding costs decreased $6.8 million due to lower average borrowings, which decreased funding costs by approximately $30.5 million, offset in part by higher average interest rates, which increased funding costs by approximately $23.7 million.

●Interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits increased $59.9 million due to higher average interest rates, which increased interest expense by approximately $49.4 million, and higher average borrowings, which increased interest expense by approximately $10.5 million.

●Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net. Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net decreased $26.4 million primarily due to a $9.5 million increase in interest income earned on the excess proceeds from the Epsilon sale on July 1, 2019 and a $6.9 million decrease in interest expense due to the early redemption of senior notes due in 2020 in April 2018, offset in part by the issuance of senior notes in December 2019. Additionally, interest expense on the revolving line of credit decreased $4.3 million due to lower average 

32 
borrowings in the current year, while interest expense on the BrandLoyalty credit agreement decreased $1.8 million due to the September 2019 repayment and amortization of debt issuance costs decreased $2.2 million due to the redemption of senior notes in 2019.

​

Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $103.7 million, or 38%, to $165.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $269.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily related to a decrease in taxable income. The effective tax rate for the current year period was 22.5% as compared to 22.2% for the prior year period. 

​

(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes was ($294.6) million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to income from discontinued operations of $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the after-tax loss on the sale of Epsilon completed July 1, 2019 and a loss contingency as described in Note 18, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For the year ended December 31, 2018, loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes represents results of operations from our former Epsilon segment, as well as certain direct costs identifiable to the Epsilon segment and allocations of interest expense on corporate debt.

​

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017

​

Revenue. Total revenue increased $191.9 million, or 4%, to $5,666.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $5,474.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:

●Services. Revenue decreased $72.1 million, or 20%, to $295.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to a $75.2 million decrease in merchant fee revenue due to increased royalty payments to our retailers associated with higher volumes and new clients.

●Redemption. Revenue decreased $259.0 million, or 28%, to $676.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Upon adoption of ASC 606, certain redemption revenue for which we do not control the good or service prior to transferring it to the collector is recorded on a net basis, which reduced both redemption revenue and cost of operations by $283.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $38.3 million in redemption revenue from our short-term loyalty programs due to an increase in the number of active programs in market as compared to the prior year.

●Finance charges, net. Revenue increased $523.0 million, or 13%, to $4,694.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was driven by an 8% increase in average credit card and loan receivables, which impacted revenue by $485.9 million through a combination of recent credit card portfolio acquisitions and new client signings, and an increase in net finance charge yield of approximately 20 basis points, which increased revenue by $37.1 million.

​

Cost of operations. Cost of operations increased $67.7 million, or 3%, to $2,537.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $2,469.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase resulted from the following:

●Within the LoyaltyOne segment, cost of operations decreased $230.6 million due to a $237.7 million decrease in cost of redemptions. This decrease in cost of redemptions was driven by a $283.4 million decrease related to the adoption of ASC 606 as discussed above, offset in part by the increase in cost of redemptions related to our short-term loyalty programs due to the increase in revenue.  

●Within the Card Services segment, cost of operations increased $298.3 million due to $101.6 million in valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card receivables held for sale, a $67.4 million increase in payroll and benefit expenses to support in-house collections and operational initiatives, and higher credit card processing costs attributable to increases in volume. 

Provision for loan loss. Provision for loan loss decreased $124.1 million, or 11%, to $1,016.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $1,140.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the change in credit card and loan receivables in each respective period, including the impact of the classification of credit card receivables held for sale, offset in part by an increase in net charge-offs.

​

33 
 General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $3.2 million, or 2%, to $162.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $159.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to an increase in professional fees, medical benefits and charitable contributions, which were offset in part by a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses realized and a decrease in incentive compensation driven by bonuses in 2017 to our non-executive associates resulting from tax reform benefits. 

​

Depreciation and other amortization. Depreciation and other amortization increased $7.0 million, or 10%, to $80.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $73.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to additional assets placed into service from capital expenditures.

​

Amortization of purchased intangibles. Amortization of purchased intangibles decreased $1.3 million, or 1%, to $112.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $114.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily due to certain fully amortized intangible assets, including portfolio premiums.

​

Interest expense, net. Total interest expense, net increased $86.9 million, or 19%, to $542.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to $455.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:

●Securitization funding costs. Securitization funding costs increased $63.6 million due to higher average interest rates, which increased funding costs by approximately $36.6 million, and higher average borrowings, which increased funding costs by approximately $27.0 million.

●Interest expense on deposits. Interest expense on deposits increased $40.6 million due to higher average borrowings, which increased interest expense by approximately $21.8 million, and higher average interest rates, which increased interest expense by approximately $18.8 million.

●Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net. Interest expense on long-term and other debt, net decreased $17.3 million due to a $42.7 million decrease in interest expense on senior notes primarily due to the repayment of senior notes due 2017 in December 2017 and senior notes due 2020 in April 2018, offset in part by a $26.5 million increase in interest expense on term debt due to higher average interest rates due to increases in the LIBOR rate. 

​

Taxes. Provision for income taxes decreased $23.8 million, or 8%, to $269.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $293.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the reduction in the federal statutory rate pursuant to tax reform enacted in December 2017. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased to 22.2% as compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2017. Additionally, income tax expense in 2018 was positively impacted by a tax benefit associated with a foreign restructuring.

​

Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes decreased $1.9 million, or 10%, to $17.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $19.5 million the year ended December 31, 2017. Income from discontinued operations, net of taxes represents results of operations from our former Epsilon segment, as well as certain direct costs identifiable to the Epsilon segment and allocations of interest expense on corporate debt.

​

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

​

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to income from continuing operations, the most directly comparable financial measure based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, plus stock compensation expense, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation and other amortization, and the amortization of purchased intangibles.

​

In 2019, adjusted EBITDA excluded costs for professional services associated with strategic initiatives, restructuring and other charges as detailed in Note 14, “Restructuring and Other Charges,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and loss related to the extinguishment of debt in July 2019. In 2016, adjusted EBITDA excluded the impact of the cancellation of the AIR MILES Reward Program’s five-year expiry policy on December 1, 2016. In 2015, adjusted EBITDA excluded costs associated with the consent orders with the FDIC. These costs, as well as stock compensation expense, were not included in the measurement of segment adjusted EBITDA as the chief operating 

34 
decision maker did not factor these expenses for purposes of assessing segment performance and decision making with respect to resource allocations.

​

Adjusted EBITDA, net is also a non-GAAP financial measure equal to adjusted EBITDA less securitization funding costs, interest expense on deposits and adjusted EBITDA attributable to the non-controlling interest. Effective April 1, 2016, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in BrandLoyalty, which increased our ownership percentage to 100%.

​

We use adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments and to evaluate the performance of our senior management, and we believe it provides useful information to our investors regarding our performance and overall results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are each considered an important indicator of the operational strength of our businesses. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect across all business segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation of tangible assets and amortization of intangible assets, including certain intangible assets that were recognized in business combinations. A limitation of this measure, however, is that it does not reflect the periodic costs of certain capitalized tangible and intangible assets used in generating revenues in our businesses. Management evaluates the costs of such tangible and intangible assets, such as capital expenditures, investment spending and return on capital and therefore the effects are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA also eliminates the non-cash effect of stock compensation expense.

​

Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are not intended to be performance measures that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income, income from continuing operations or net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. In addition, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net are not intended to represent funds available for dividends, reinvestment or other discretionary uses, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

​

The adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, net measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.

Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018

​

Revenue. Total revenue decreased $85.3 million, or 2%, to $5,581.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $5,666.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was due to the following:

●LoyaltyOne. Revenue decreased $35.3 million, or 3%, to $1,033.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, impacted by the decline in both the Euro and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in a $45.0 million decrease in revenue, and by a $43.0 million decrease in revenue related to the outsourcing of additional rewards inventory recorded on a net basis. The declines were partially offset by strong performance in Europe, Asia and Brazil related to our short-term loyalty programs.

●Card Services. Revenue decreased $49.8 million, or 1%, to $4,547.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by a $109.0 million decrease in merchant fees as a result of increased payments associated with new clients and a $10.0 million decrease in other servicing fees charged to cardholders related to certain payment protection products. These decreases were offset in part by a $35.5 million increase in other servicing revenue related to fees generated from servicing certain third-party credit card receivables and a $33.6 million increase in finance charges, net due to an increase in normalized average receivables for the year ended December 31, 2019.

​

Adjusted EBITDA, net. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $338.1 million, or 21%, to $1,271.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from $1,609.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The net decrease was due to the following:

●LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $9.7 million, or 4%, to $244.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as a result of an unfavorable foreign exchange rate impact due to the decline in both the Euro and the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar, which resulted in an $8.3 million decrease in adjusted EBITDA, net. Restructuring and other charges of $50.8 million and strategic transaction costs of $1.0 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net for the year ended December 31, 2019.

●Card Services. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $376.3 million, or 25%, to $1,119.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to a $171.5 million increase in provision for loan loss, an $88.1 million increase in valuation adjustments to certain portfolios within credit card receivables held for sale and a $53.1 million increase in funding costs in the current year. Restructuring and other charges of $29.4 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net for the year ended December 31, 2019.

●Corporate/Other. Adjusted EBITDA, net improved $47.9 million to a loss of $92.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to cost saving initiatives implemented in the first half of 2019, which among other 

36 
items included reduced headcount, office space, charitable contributions and overall corporate overhead costs. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $71.9 million, restructuring costs of $37.9 million and strategic transaction costs of $10.7 million were excluded from adjusted EBITDA, net for the year ended December 31, 2019.

​

Year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017

​

Revenue. Total revenue increased $191.9 million, or 4%, to $5,666.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $5,474.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:

●LoyaltyOne. Revenue decreased $235.1 million, or 18%, to $1,068.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily due to the adoption of ASC 606, which negatively impacted revenue by $283.4 million. This decrease was offset in part by a 12% increase in revenue from our short-term loyalty programs primarily due to an increase in the number of active programs in market.

●Card Services. Revenue increased $427.0 million, or 10%, to $4,597.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, driven by a $523.0 million increase in finance charges, net as a result of an 8% increase in average credit card and loan receivables. This increase was offset in part by a decrease in servicing fees of $96.0 million, as merchant fee revenue declined $75.2 million due to increased royalty payments to our retailers associated with higher volumes and new clients, and other servicing fees charged to cardholders declined $19.2 million due in part to a decline in revenue from certain payment protection products.

​

Adjusted EBITDA, net. Adjusted EBITDA, net increased $144.0 million, or 10%, to $1,609.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 from $1,465.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net increase was due to the following:

●LoyaltyOne. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $2.5 million, or 1%, to $254.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of lower margin programs in key markets within our short-term loyalty programs and weakened performance in Asia. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

●Corporate/Other. Adjusted EBITDA, net decreased $4.6 million to a loss of $140.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to an increase in professional fees, medical benefits and charitable contributions, which were offset by a decrease in net foreign currency exchange losses realized and a decrease in incentive compensation driven by bonuses in 2017 to our non-executive associates resulting from tax reform benefits.

​

Asset Quality

​

Our delinquency and net charge-off rates reflect, among other factors, the credit risk of our credit card and loan receivables, the success of our collection and recovery efforts, and general economic conditions. 

​

Delinquencies. A credit card account is contractually delinquent if we do not receive the minimum payment by the specified due date on the cardholder’s statement. Our policy is to continue to accrue interest and fee income on all credit card accounts beyond 90 days, except in limited circumstances, until the credit card account balance and all related interest and other fees are paid or charged-off, typically at 180 days delinquent. When an account becomes delinquent, a message is printed on the credit cardholder’s billing statement requesting payment. After an account becomes 30 days past due, a proprietary collection scoring algorithm automatically scores the risk of the account becoming further delinquent. The collection system then recommends a collection strategy for the past due account based on the collection score and account balance and dictates the contact schedule and collections priority for the account. If we are unable to make a collection after exhausting all in-house collection efforts, we may engage collection agencies and outside attorneys to continue those efforts.

​

37 
The following table presents the delinquency trends of our credit card and loan receivables portfolio:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Net Charge-Offs. Our net charge-offs include the principal amount of losses from cardholders unwilling or unable to pay their account balances, as well as bankrupt and deceased credit cardholders, less recoveries and exclude charged-off interest, fees and fraud losses. Charged-off interest and fees reduce finance charges, net while fraud losses are recorded as an expense. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, are charged-off in the month during which an account becomes 180 days contractually past due, except in the case of customer bankruptcies or death. Credit card and loan receivables, including unpaid interest and fees, associated with customer bankruptcies or death are charged-off in each month subsequent to 60 days after the receipt of notification of the bankruptcy or death, but in any case, not later than the 180-day contractual time frame.

​

The net charge-off rate is calculated by dividing net charge-offs of principal receivables for the period by the average credit card and loan receivables for the period. Average credit card and loan receivables represent the average balance of the cardholder receivables at the beginning of each month in the periods indicated. The following table presents our net charge-offs for the periods indicated:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Liquidity and Capital Resources

​

Our primary sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities, our credit agreements and issuances of debt or equity securities, our credit card securitization program and deposits issued by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. In addition to our efforts to renew and expand our current liquidity sources, we continue to seek new funding sources. In April 2019, Comenity Capital Bank launched a consumer retail deposit platform, Comenity Direct™, to the public; retail deposits comprised approximately $1.2 billion of our $12.2 billion deposits outstanding at December 31, 2019.

​

Our primary uses of cash are for ongoing business operations, repayments of our debt, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, stock repurchases and dividends.

​

We may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases or exchanges for other securities, in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors, and may be funded through the issuance of debt securities. The amounts involved may be material.

​

On July 1, 2019, we sold our former Epsilon segment to Publicis Groupe S.A. for $4.4 billion in cash. Proceeds were used for the repayment of corporate debt, share repurchases, and payment of taxes associated with the sale.

We believe that internally generated funds and other sources of liquidity discussed below will be sufficient to meet working capital needs, capital expenditures, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.

Cash Flow Activity

​

Operating Activities. We generated cash flow from operating activities of $1,217.7 million and $2,754.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flows of $1,537.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to lower profitability and the sale of Epsilon in July 2019. 

​

Investing Activities. Cash provided by investing activities was $2,860.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and cash used in investing activities was $1,872.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Significant components of investing activities are as follows:

●Credit card and loan receivables. Cash decreased $2,586.8 million and $2,749.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to growth in credit card and loan receivables in each respective year.

●Proceeds from sale of business. Cash increased $4,409.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the sale of Epsilon on July 1, 2019.

●Purchase of credit card portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid cash consideration of $924.8 million to acquire four credit card portfolios. No credit card portfolios were acquired in 2018.

●Proceeds from sale of credit card portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received cash consideration of $2,061.8 million from the sale of 13 credit card portfolios. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received cash consideration of $1,153.5 million from the sale of six credit card portfolios.

●Capital expenditures. Cash paid for capital expenditures was $142.3 million and $199.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures to continue to be less than 3% of annual revenue.

​

Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $4,091.7 million and $1,217.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Significant components of financing activities are as follows:

●Debt. Cash decreased $2,870.5 million as a result of net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to the July 2019 early extinguishment of $1.9 billion outstanding senior notes upon consummation of the sale of Epsilon and the mandatory payment of $500.0 million on our revolving credit facility. In December 2019, we issued $850.0 million in senior notes, of which the net proceeds of $833.0 million were used to make a prepayment of our term debt under the credit agreement. Cash decreased $317.7 million in net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the redemption of $500.0 million senior notes due in 2020. 

●Non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities. Cash decreased $367.2 million in net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to net repayments under the conduit facilities. Cash decreased $1,156.4 million in net repayments for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $985.0 million in net repayments under the conduit facilities and $171.4 million in net maturities under the asset-backed term notes. 

●Deposits. Cash increased $355.6 million and $864.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to new issuances, offset in part by timing of maturities.

●Dividends. Cash paid for quarterly dividends and dividend equivalents was $127.4 million and $125.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

●Treasury shares. Cash paid for treasury shares was $976.1 million and $443.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Credit Agreement

​

At December 31, 2018, our credit agreement, as amended, provided for $3,052.6 million in term loans subject to certain principal repayments and a $1,572.4 million revolving line of credit.

​

On April 30, 2019, we amended our credit agreement to provide that, upon consummation of the sale of Epsilon, the maturity date of the credit agreement would be reduced by one year from June 14, 2022 to June 14, 2021, a mandatory payment of $500 million of the revolving credit facility would be required, the aggregate revolving credit commitments would be reduced in the same amount (to $1,072.4 million), all of our outstanding senior notes would be required to be redeemed, net proceeds from future asset sales in excess of $50 million must be applied to repayment of the credit agreement and certain other minor amendments.

​

In July 2019, we made a mandatory payment of $500.0 million on our revolving credit facility, with the aggregate revolving credit commitments reduced to $1,072.4 million. 

​

On December 20, 2019, we amended our credit agreement to extend the maturity date from June 14, 2021 to December 31, 2022, reduce the aggregate revolving credit commitments from $1,072.4 million to $750.0 million, add a consolidated minimum tangible net worth covenant upon certain triggering events and make certain other amendments. The amendment also required us to prepay the term loans to $2,028.8 million upon consummation of the offering of the Senior Notes due 2024, which obligation was satisfied in full with a prepayment of $833.0 million, representing the net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes due 2024. 

​

At December 31, 2019, our credit agreement, as amended, provided for $2,028.8 million in term loans subject to certain principal repayments and a $750.0 million revolving line of credit. As of December 31, 2019, there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and the total availability was $750.0 million. Our total leverage ratio, as defined in our credit agreement, was 1.6 to 1 at December 31, 2019, as compared to the maximum covenant ratio of 3.5 to 1.

​

As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.

​

BrandLoyalty Credit Agreement

​

In September 2019, we repaid the €115.0 million in term loans outstanding under the BrandLoyalty credit agreement, originally scheduled to mature in June 2020, and repaid the €32.5 million amount outstanding under the revolving line of credit. 

​

Senior Notes

​

In July 2019, with the proceeds from the Epsilon transaction, we extinguished all of our senior notes, which had an outstanding balance of $1.9 billion. 

​

In December 2019, we issued and sold $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.750% senior notes due December 15, 2024. The Senior Notes due 2024 accrue interest on the principal amount at the rate of 4.750% per annum from December 20, 2019, payable semi-annually in arrears, on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2020. The Senior Notes due 2024 will mature on December 15, 2024, subject to earlier repurchase or redemption.

See Note 16, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our debt.

​

Funding Sources

​

Deposits

​

We utilize money market deposits and certificates of deposit to finance the operating activities, including funding for our non-securitized credit card receivables, and fund securitization enhancement requirements of our bank subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. 

​

Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank offer non-maturity deposit programs through contractual arrangements with various financial counterparties. As of December 31, 2019, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank had $3.6 billion in money market deposits outstanding with interest rates ranging from 1.84% to 3.50%. Money market deposits are redeemable on demand by the customer and, as such, have no scheduled maturity date. 

​

Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank issue certificates of deposit in denominations of at least $100,000 and $1,000, respectively, in various maturities ranging between January 2020 and December 2024 and with effective annual interest rates ranging from 1.33% to 4.00%. As of December 31, 2019, we had $8.6 billion of certificates of deposit outstanding. Certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements.

​

Securitization Program

​

We sell a majority of the credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank to WFN Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust, World Financial Network Credit Card Master Note Trust, or Master Trust I, and World Financial Network Credit Card Master Trust III, or Master Trust III, or collectively, the WFN Trusts, as part of our credit card securitization program, which has been in existence since January 1996. We also sell our credit card receivables originated by Comenity Capital Bank to World Financial Capital Credit Company, LLC, which in turn sells them to World Financial Capital Master Note Trust, or the WFC Trust. These securitization programs are a principal vehicle through which we finance Comenity Bank’s and Comenity Capital Bank’s credit card receivables. Historically, we have used both public and private term asset-backed securitization transactions as well as private conduit facilities as sources of funding for our securitized credit card receivables. Private conduit facilities have been used to accommodate seasonality needs and to bridge to completion of asset-backed securitization transactions.

​

During the year ended December 31, 2019, Master Trust I issued $1.6 billion of asset-backed term notes with various maturities ranging between February 2022 and September 2022, of which $74.1 million were retained by us and eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, $1.9 billion of asset-backed term notes matured and were repaid, of which $347.9 million were retained by us and eliminated from the consolidated balance sheets.

​

As of December 31, 2019, the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust had approximately $13.5 billion of securitized credit card receivables. Securitizations require credit enhancements in the form of cash, spread deposits, additional receivables and subordinated classes. The credit enhancement is principally based on the outstanding balances of the series issued by the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust and by the performance of the credit card receivables in these credit card securitization trusts. 

​

We have access to committed undrawn capacity through three conduit facilities to support the funding of our credit card receivables through Master Trust I, Master Trust III and the WFC Trust. As of December 31, 2019, total capacity under the conduit facilities was $4.7 billion, of which $2.4 billion had been drawn and was included in non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities in the consolidated balance sheets. Borrowings outstanding under each facility bear interest at a margin above LIBOR or the asset-backed commercial paper costs of each individual conduit provider. The conduits have varying maturities from September 2020 to April 2021 with variable interest rates ranging from 2.79% to 2.96% as of December 31, 2019. 

41 
​

The following table shows the maturities of borrowing commitments as of December 31, 2019 for the WFN Trusts and the WFC Trust by year:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Amount represents borrowing capacity, not outstanding borrowings.

(2)Total amounts do not include $1.4 billion of debt issued by the credit card securitization trusts, which was retained by us and has been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.

​

Early amortization events as defined within each asset-backed securitization transaction are generally driven by asset performance. We do not believe it is reasonably likely that an early amortization event will occur due to asset performance. However, if an early amortization event were declared, the trustee of the particular credit card securitization trust would retain the interest in the receivables along with the excess interest income that would otherwise be paid to our bank subsidiary until the credit card securitization investors were fully repaid. The occurrence of an early amortization event would significantly limit or negate our ability to securitize additional credit card receivables.

​

We have secured and continue to secure the necessary commitments to fund our portfolio of credit card receivables originated by Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. However, certain of these commitments are short-term in nature and subject to renewal. There is not a guarantee that these funding sources, when they mature, will be renewed on similar terms or at all as they are dependent on the availability of the asset-backed securitization and deposit markets at the time.

​

See Note 16, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our securitized debt.

​

Stock Repurchase Programs

​

We had an authorized stock repurchase program to acquire up to $500.0 million of our outstanding common stock from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019. At December 31, 2018 we had $222.8 million remaining under the stock repurchase program. For the six months ended June 30, 2019, we acquired a total of 1.3 million shares of our common stock for $222.8 million. At June 30, 2019, we did not have any amounts remaining under our authorization.

​

In July 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $1.1 billion of our outstanding common stock from July 5, 2019 through June 30, 2020.

​

In August 2019, we repurchased approximately 5.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately $750.0 million as part of a “modified Dutch Auction” tender offer, as described in more detail in Note 19, “Stockholders’ Equity,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

As of December 31, 2019, we had $347.8 million remaining under our authorized stock repurchase program.

​

Dividends

​

For the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.63 per share of $126.3 million and $1.1 million in cash related to dividend equivalent rights, for a total of $127.4 million. 

​

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.57 per share of $124.9 million and $0.3 million in cash related to dividend equivalent rights, for a total of $125.2 million.

​

On January 30, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.63 per share on our common stock, payable on March 19, 2020 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 14, 2020.

42 
​

Contractual Obligations 

​

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments by type and period as of December 31, 2019 are summarized below:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The deposits, non-recourse borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and long-term and other debt represent our estimated debt service obligations, including both principal and interest. Interest was based on the interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2019, applied to the contractual repayment period.

(2)ASC 740 obligations do not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $278.6 million, of which the timing remains uncertain.

(3)Purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding and specifying all significant terms, including the following: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligation amounts disclosed above represent estimates of the minimum for which we are obligated and the time period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. Purchase obligations include sponsor commitments under our AIR MILES Reward Program, minimum payments under support and maintenance contracts and agreements to purchase other goods and services.

​

We believe that we will have access to sufficient resources to meet these commitments.

​

Inflation and Seasonality

​

Although we cannot precisely determine the impact of inflation on our operations, we do not believe that we have been significantly affected by inflation. For the most part, we have relied on operating efficiencies from scale, technology and expansion in lower cost jurisdictions in select circumstances, as well as decreases in technology and communication costs, to offset increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses. With respect to seasonality, our revenues, earnings and cash flows are affected by increased consumer spending patterns leading up to and including the holiday shopping period in the fourth quarter and, to a lesser extent, during the first quarter as credit card and loan receivable balances are paid down.

​

Legislative and Regulatory Matters

​

Comenity Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the State of Delaware and the FDIC. Comenity Capital Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by both the FDIC and the State of Utah. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of its assets and liabilities as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by these regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are limited in the amounts that they can pay as dividends to us.

​

On September 10, 2019, Comenity Capital Bank submitted a bank merger application to the FDIC seeking the FDIC’s approval to merge Comenity Bank with and into Comenity Capital Bank as the surviving bank entity. On the same date, Comenity Capital Bank and Comenity Bank each submitted counterpart bank merger applications to the Utah 

43 
Department of Financial Institutions and the Delaware Office of the State Bank Commissioner, respectively, in connection with the proposed merger. The merger application remains subject to regulatory review and approval and no guarantee can be provided as to the outcome or timing of such review.

​

Quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk weighted assets and of Tier 1 capital to average assets. Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are considered well capitalized. The actual capital ratios and minimum ratios as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:

​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

In September 2015, each bank entered into a consent order with the FDIC in settlement of the FDIC’s review regarding the marketing, promotion and sale of certain add-on products; these consent orders were terminated in August 2018.

​

In August 2014, the SEC adopted a number of rules that will change the disclosure, reporting and offering process for publicly registered offerings of asset-backed securities, including those offered under our credit card securitization program. A number of rules proposed by the SEC in 2010 and 2011, such as requiring group-level data for the underlying assets in credit card securitizations, were not adopted in 2014 but may be implemented by the SEC in the future with or without modifications. The SEC has also issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking relating to the exemptions that our credit card securitization trusts rely on in our credit card securitization program to avoid registration as investment companies.

​

Regulations adopted by the FDIC, the SEC, the Federal Reserve and certain other federal regulators mandate a minimum five percent risk retention requirement for securitizations issued on and after December 24, 2016, known as Regulation RR. Such risk retention requirements may limit our liquidity by restricting the amount of asset-backed securities we are able to issue or affecting the timing of future issuances of asset-backed securities; we intend to satisfy such risk retention requirements by maintaining a seller’s interest calculated in accordance with Regulation RR.

​

Discussion of Critical Accounting Estimates

​

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies that are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our judgments and estimates in determination of our financial condition and operating results. Estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements and, accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates, sometimes materially. Critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and require management’s most subjective judgments. The primary critical accounting estimates are described below. 

​

44 
Allowance for Loan Loss. 

​

We maintain an allowance for loan loss at a level that is appropriate to absorb probable losses inherent in credit card and loan receivables. The estimate of our allowance for loan loss considers uncollectible principal as well as unpaid interest and fees reflected in the credit card and loan receivables. While our estimation process includes historical data and analysis, there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results to determine the allowance for loan loss. We use a migration analysis to estimate the future likelihood that a credit card or loan receivable will progress through the various stages of delinquency and to charge-off based on historical performance. In evaluating the allowance for loan loss for both principal and unpaid interest and fees, past and current credit card and loan performance is considered in addition to factors that may impact loan loss experience, including seasoning and growth, account collection strategies, economic conditions, bankruptcy filings, policy changes, payment rates and forecasting uncertainties. Given the same information, others may reach different reasonable estimates.

​

If we used different assumptions in estimating net charge-offs that could be incurred, the impact to the allowance for loan loss could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For example, a 100 basis point change in our estimate of incurred net loan losses could have resulted in a change of approximately $186 million in the allowance for loan loss at December 31, 2019, with a corresponding change in the provision for loan loss.

​

Effective January 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” For additional information regarding the impact of this standard, see “Recently Issued Accounting Standards” under Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

Revenue Recognition. 

​

We recognize revenue when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to the customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. In that determination, under ASC 606, we follow a five-step model that includes: (1) determination of whether a contract, an agreement between two or more parties that creates legally enforceable rights and obligations, exists; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

​

We enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple performance obligations. The transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. If the standalone selling price is not directly observable, we estimate the standalone selling price based on either the adjusted market assessment or cost plus a margin approach. 

​

Certain of our contracts may provide for variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on either the expected amount or most likely amount to be provided to the customer to determine the transaction price for the contract. The estimation method is consistent for contracts with similar terms and is applied consistently throughout each contract. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the anticipated performance and all information that is reasonably available.

​

AIR MILES Reward Program. The AIR MILES Reward Program collects fees from its sponsors based on the number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and, in limited circumstances, the number of AIR MILES reward miles redeemed. Because management has determined that the earnings process is not complete at the time an AIR MILES reward mile is issued, the recognition of redemption and service revenue is deferred. Under certain of our contracts, a portion of the consideration is paid to us upon the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles and a portion is paid at the time of redemption and therefore, we do not have a redemption obligation related to these contracts. 

​

Total consideration from the issuance of AIR MILES reward miles is allocated to three performance obligations: redemption, service, and brand, based on a relative standalone selling price basis. 

​

The estimated standalone selling price for the redemption and the service performance obligations are based on cost plus a reasonable margin. The estimated standalone selling price of the brand performance obligation is determined using a relief from royalty approach. Accordingly, management determines the estimated standalone selling price by 

45 
considering multiple inputs and methods, including discounted cash flows and available market data in consideration of applicable margins and royalty rates to utilize. The number of AIR MILES reward miles issued and redeemed are factored into the estimates, as management estimates the standalone selling prices and volumes over the term of the respective agreements in order to determine the allocation of consideration to each performance obligation delivered. The redemption performance obligation incorporates the expected number of AIR MILES reward miles to be redeemed, and therefore, the amount of redemption revenue recognized is subject to management’s estimate of breakage, or those AIR MILES reward miles estimated to be unredeemed by the collector base. Additionally, the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile impacts the timing of revenue recognition.

​

Breakage and the life of an AIR MILES reward mile are based on management’s estimate after viewing and analyzing various historical trends including vintage analysis, current run rates and other pertinent factors, such as the impact of macroeconomic factors and changes in the program structure. 

​

Throughout 2018 and 2019, our estimated breakage rate remained 20%. Our cumulative redemption rate, which represents program to date redemptions divided by program to date issuance, is 70% as of December 31, 2019. We expect the ultimate redemption rate will approximate 80% based on our historical redemption patterns, statistical regression models, and consideration of enacted program changes, as applicable.

​

Throughout 2018 and 2019, our estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile remained 38 months. We estimate that a change to the estimated life of an AIR MILES reward mile of one month would impact revenue by approximately $5 million. 

​

Any future changes in collector behavior could result in further changes in our estimates of breakage or life of an AIR MILES reward mile.

​

As of December 31, 2019, we had $922.0 million in deferred revenue related to the AIR MILES Reward Program that will be recognized in the future. Further information is provided in Note 3, “Revenue,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

​

Goodwill.

​

We test goodwill for impairment annually, as of July 31, or when events and circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. ASC 350, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other,” permits the assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances lead to the conclusion that it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test required under ASC 350. ASC 350 also allows the option to skip the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to a quantitative assessment. 

​

For our qualitative analysis, we consider the totality of relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value or carrying value of the reporting unit. These events and circumstances include macroeconomic conditions, industry and competitive environment conditions, overall financial performance, reporting unit specific events and market considerations. We may also consider recent valuations of the reporting unit, including the magnitude of the difference between the most recent fair value estimate and the carrying value, as well as both positive and adverse events and circumstances, and the extent to which each of the events and circumstances identified may affect the comparison of a reporting unit’s fair value with its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit.

​

For our quantitative analysis, the fair value of the reporting units is estimated using both an income- and market-based approach. Our income-based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis based on management's estimates of forecasted cash flows, with those cash flows discounted to present value using rates commensurate with the risks associated with those cash flows. The valuation includes assumptions related to revenue growth and profit performance, capital expenditures, the discount rate and other assumptions that are judgmental in nature. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the results of our tests for goodwill impairment. The market-based approach involves an analysis of market multiples of revenues and earnings to a group of comparable public companies and recent transactions, if any, involving comparable companies. While the guideline companies in the market-based valuation method have comparability to the reporting units, they may not fully reflect the market share, product portfolio and operations of the reporting units. In addition, we also consult independent valuation experts in applying these valuation 

46 
techniques. We generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market-based valuation approach. 

​

For the 2019 annual impairment test, we performed a qualitative analysis for the Card Services reporting unit and determined that it was more likely than not that there was no impairment of goodwill. We performed a quantitative analysis for the reporting units within the LoyaltyOne segment, identified as BrandLoyalty and LoyaltyOne excluding BrandLoyalty. We determined there was no impairment of goodwill on these reporting units. 

​

As of December 31, 2019, we had goodwill of approximately $954.9 million. The following table presents the December 31, 2019 goodwill by reporting unit as well as the percentage by which fair value of the reporting units exceeded carrying value as of the 2019 annual impairment test:

 ​[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)In 2019, the Company elected to perform a qualitative analysis for Card Services. In 2018, the fair value of Card Services exceeded carrying value by approximately 390 to 460 percent.

​

As with all assumptions, there is an inherent level of uncertainty and actual results, to the extent they differ from those assumptions, could have a material impact on fair value. For example, a reduction in customer demand would impact our assumed growth rate resulting in a reduced fair value, or multiples for similar type reporting units could deteriorate due to changes in technology or a downturn in economic conditions. Potential events or circumstances could have a negative effect on the estimated fair value. The loss of a major customer or program could have a significant impact on the future cash flows of the reporting unit(s). 

​

We do not currently believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in estimates or assumptions used to test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material. 

​

Income Taxes. 

​

We account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 740, “Income Taxes.” The application of income tax law is inherently complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous. As such, we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Interpretations of, and guidance surrounding, income tax laws and regulations change over time. Changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of income.
