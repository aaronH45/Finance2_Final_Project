Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes and the corresponding changes in the market values of our debt and foreign currency fluctuations. 

Interest Rate Risk

At December 31, 2019, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds. Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate. 

As of December 31, 2019, we had $14.9 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2021 and 2030. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances. The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below. 

Foreign Currency Risk

Revenues denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar account for 50% of the consolidated amount for the year ended December 31, 2019. We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese yen, the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real.

Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 

30
our revenues would have been approximately $762 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those for the year ended December 31, 2018.

We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency. In the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized a $7 million foreign exchange gain due to the remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of our European and U.S. entities.

Exchange rate changes had an immaterial impact on cash and cash equivalents in the year ended December 31, 2019. 

We do not use foreign exchange contracts or derivatives to hedge any foreign currency exposures. The volatility of exchange rates depends on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy. Our continued international expansion increases our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and as a result such fluctuations could have a significant impact on our future results of operations.
