ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Management's Overview and Summary

The Company is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community/power shopping centers located throughout the United States. The Company is the sole general partner of, and owns a majority of the ownership interests in, the Operating Partnership. As of December 31, 2019, the Operating Partnership owned or had an ownership interest in 47 regional shopping centers and five community/power shopping centers. These 52 regional and community/power shopping centers (which include any related office space) consist of approximately 51 million square feet of gross leasable area (“GLA”) and are referred to herein as the “Centers”. The Centers consist of consolidated Centers (“Consolidated Centers”) and unconsolidated joint venture Centers (“Unconsolidated Joint Venture Centers”) as set forth in “Item 2. Properties,” unless the context otherwise requires. The Company is a self-administered and self-managed REIT and conducts all of its operations through the Operating Partnership and the Management Companies. 

The following discussion is based primarily on the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. It compares the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018. Also included is a comparison of the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018 to the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2017. This information should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

On March 1, 2018, the Company formed a 25/75 joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties, whereby the Company agreed to contribute Westside Pavilion (referred to hereafter as One Westside), a 680,000 square foot regional shopping center in Los Angeles, California in exchange for $142.5 million. The Company completed the sale of the 75% ownership interest in the property to Hudson Pacific Properties on August 31, 2018, resulting in a gain on sale of assets of $46.2 million. The sales price was funded by a cash payment of $36.9 million and the assumption of a pro rata share of the mortgage note payable on the property of $105.6 million. The Company used the proceeds to fund its share of the cost to defease the mortgage note payable on the property (See "Financing Activity"). From March 1, 2018 to the completion of the sale, the Company accounted for its interest in the property as a collaborative arrangement (See Note 15—Collaborative Arrangement of the Company's consolidated financial statements). Upon completion of the sale, the Company has accounted for its ownership interest in the property under the equity method of accounting. 

On May 17, 2018, the Company sold Promenade at Casa Grande, a 761,000 square foot community center in Casa Grande, Arizona for $26.0 million, resulting in a loss on sale of assets of $0.3 million.

Redevelopment and Development Activity:

On September 19, 2019, the Company's joint venture with Pennsylvania REIT opened the first phase of the redevelopment of Fashion District Philadelphia, an 899,000 square foot regional shopping center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The project will have additional tenant openings throughout 2020 and early 2021. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between $400.0 million and $420.0 million, with $200.0 million to $210.0 million estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $190.9 million of the total $381.8 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2019.

The Company's joint venture in Scottsdale Fashion Square completed the redevelopment of a former Barney's store and an 80,000 square foot exterior expansion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Company has funded $40.0 million of the total $80.0 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2019.

The Company's joint venture with Hudson Pacific Properties is redeveloping One Westside into 584,000 square feet of creative office space and 96,000 square feet of dining and entertainment space. The entire creative office space has been leased to Google and is expected to be completed in 2022. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between $500.0 million and $550.0 million, with $125.0 million to $137.5 million estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded $50.4 million of the total $201.5 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2019. The joint venture expects to fund the remaining costs of the development with its new $414.6 million construction loan (See "Financing Activities"). 

The Company has a 50/50 joint venture with Simon Property Group to develop Los Angeles Premium Outlets, a premium outlet center in Carson, California that is planned to open with approximately 400,000 square feet, followed by an additional 165,000 square feet in the second phase. The Company has funded $35.9 million of the total $71.7 million incurred by the joint venture as of December 31, 2019.

In connection with the closures and lease rejections of several Sears stores owned or partially owned by the Company, the Company anticipates spending between $130.0 million to $160.0 million at the Company’s pro rata share to redevelop the Sears stores. The anticipated openings of such redevelopments are expected to occur over several years. The estimated range of redevelopment costs could increase if the Company or its joint venture decides to expand the scope of the redevelopments.The Company has funded $22.4 million at its pro rata share as of December 31, 2019. 

Other Transactions and Events:

On February 12, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500.0 million of its outstanding common shares as market conditions and the Company’s liquidity warrant (the "2017 Stock Buyback Program"). Repurchases may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, structured or derivative transactions, including ASR transactions, or other methods of acquiring shares, from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements. During the period from February 12, 2017 to December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased a total of 3,627,390 of its common shares for $221.4 million, representing an average price of $61.01 per share. The Company funded the repurchases from the net proceeds of the sale of Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions"), its share of the proceeds from the sale of ownership interests in office buildings at Fashion District Philadelphia and Country Club Plaza (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions") and from borrowings under its line of credit. There were no repurchases during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.

On January 1, 2018, upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, "Revenue From Contracts With Customers (ASC 606)", the Company changed its accounting for Chandler Freehold from a co-venture arrangement to a financing arrangement ("Financing Arrangement"). As a result, the Company no longer records co-venture expense for its partner's share of the income of Chandler Freehold. Under the Financing Arrangement, the Company recognizes interest expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the Financing Arrangement obligation, (ii) any payments to the joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income.

On February 1 and 2, 2018, the Company reduced its workforce by approximately 10 percent. The Company incurred a one-time charge of $12.7 million in connection with the workforce reduction during the year ended December 31, 2018. As a result of the workforce reduction, the Company, exclusive of the one-time charge, reduced expenses by approximately $10.0 million during the year ending December 31, 2018.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company incurred $19.4 million in costs associated with activities related to shareholder activism. These costs were primarily for legal and advisory services.

43

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 842, "Leases", under the modified retrospective method. The new standard amended the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both parties to a contract (i.e. lessees and lessors). In connection with the adoption of the new lease standard, the Company elected to use the transition packages of practical expedients for implementation provided by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), which included (i) relief from re-assessing whether an expired or existing contract meets the definition of a lease, (ii) relief from re-assessing the classification of expired or existing leases at the adoption date, (iii) allowing previously capitalized initial direct leasing costs to continue to be amortized, and (iv) application of the standard as of the adoption date rather than to all periods presented.

Upon adoption of the new standard, the Company has presented all revenues associated with leases as leasing revenue on its consolidated statements of operations. For comparison purposes, the Company has reclassified minimum rents, percentage rents, tenant recoveries and other leasing income to leasing revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2019. The new standard requires the Company to reduce leasing revenue for credit losses associated with lease receivables. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the provision for bad debts is included in shopping center and operating expenses. In addition, straight-line rent receivables are written off when the Company believes there is reasonable uncertainty regarding a tenant's ability to complete the term of the lease. As a result, the Company recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of $2.2 million upon adoption for the write off of straight-line rent receivables of tenants that were in litigation or bankruptcy. 

The new standard requires that lessors expense, on an as-incurred basis, certain initial direct costs that are not incremental in negotiating a lease. Initial direct costs include the salaries and related costs for employees directly working on leasing activities. Prior to January 1, 2019, these costs were capitalizable and therefore the new lease standard resulted in certain of these costs being expensed as incurred. For comparison purposes, the Company has reclassified leasing costs that were included in management companies' operating expenses to leasing expenses for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2019. 

Inflation:

In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, approximately 5% to 15% of the leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. 

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical.

Acquisitions:

The Company allocates the estimated fair value of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an “as if vacant” methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with “cost avoidance” of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the “assumed vacant” property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above 

44

or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. The initial allocation of purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may change when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which does not exceed one year. The purchase price allocation is described as preliminary if it is not yet final. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses.

The Company immediately expenses costs associated with business combinations as period costs and capitalizes costs associated with asset acquisitions. 

Remeasurement gains are recognized when the Company obtains control of an existing equity method investment to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment.

Asset Impairment:

The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis or a contracted sales price, with the carrying value of the related assets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. Properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:

The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions.

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

45

The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made.

The Company records its Financing Arrangement obligation at fair value on a recurring basis with changes in fair value being recorded as interest expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow model, with the significant unobservable inputs including discount rate, terminal capitalization rate, and market rents. The fair value of the Financing Arrangement obligation is sensitive to these significant unobservable inputs and a change in these inputs may result in a significantly higher or lower fair value measurement. 

Results of Operations

Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company's properties described above, including those related to the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Centers and the Disposition Properties (each as defined below). 

For purposes of the discussion below, the Company defines "Same Centers" as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include those Centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center (“Redevelopment Properties”), those properties that have recently transitioned to or from equity method joint ventures to consolidated assets ("JV Transition Centers") and properties that have been disposed of ("Disposition Properties"). The Company moves a Center in and out of Same Centers based on whether the Center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the Same Centers consist of all consolidated Centers, excluding the Redevelopment Properties, the JV Transition Center and the Disposition Properties for the periods of comparison.

For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018 and the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017, the Redevelopment Properties are Paradise Valley Mall and certain ground up developments. 

For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018 and the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017, the JV Transition Center is One Westside. The change in revenues and expenses at the JV Transition Center is primarily due to the conversion of One Westside from a Consolidated Center to an Unconsolidated Joint Venture Center. 

For comparison of the year ended December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2018, the Disposition Property is Promenade at Casa Grande. For the comparison of the year ended December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2017, the Disposition Properties are Promenade at Casa Grande, 500 North Michigan Avenue, Cascade Mall and Northgate Mall.

Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures.

The Company considers tenant annual sales per square foot (for tenants in place for a minimum of 12 months or longer and 10,000 square feet and under) for regional shopping centers, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or "Anchors") for the Centers and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of initial average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot at expiration for the leases expiring during the year based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth.

Tenant sales per square foot increased from $726 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $801 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. Occupancy rate decreased from 95.4% at December 31, 2018 to 94.0% at December 31, 2019. Releasing spreads remained positive as the Company was able to lease available space at average higher rents than the expiring rental rates, resulting in a releasing spread of $2.65 per square foot ($59.15 on new and renewal leases executed compared to $56.50 on leases expiring), representing a 4.7% increase for the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The Company expects that releasing spreads will continue to be positive for 2020 as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expire. These leases that are scheduled to expire represent approximately 930,000 square feet of the Centers, accounting for 14.0% of the GLA of mall stores and freestanding stores, for spaces 10,000 square feet and under, as of December 31, 2019. These calculations exclude Centers under development or redevelopment and property dispositions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Redevelopment and Development Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary).

46

During the trailing twelve months ended December 31, 2019, the Company signed 359 new leases and 579 renewal leases comprising approximately 3.5 million square feet of GLA, of which 2.3 million square feet related to the consolidated Centers. The average tenant allowance was $29.25 per square foot.

Outlook

The Company has a long-term four-pronged business strategy that focuses on the acquisition, leasing and management, redevelopment and development of Regional Shopping Centers. Although the Company believes that overall regional shopping center fundamentals in its markets appear reasonably strong, the Company expects that its results for 2020 will be negatively impacted by Anchor closures and tenant bankruptcies, among other factors.

Rising interest rates could increase the cost of the Company’s borrowings due to its outstanding floating-rate debt and lead to higher interest rates on new fixed-rate debt. In certain cases, the Company may limit its exposure to interest rate fluctuations related to a portion of its floating-rate debt by using interest rate cap and swap agreements. Such agreements, subject to current market conditions, allow the Company to replace floating-rate debt with fixed-rate debt in order to achieve its desired ratio of floating-rate to fixed-rate debt. However, in an increasing interest rate environment the fixed rates the Company can obtain with such replacement fixed-rate cap and swap agreements or the fixed-rate on new debt will also continue to increase.

In recent years, a number of companies in the retail industry, including some of the Company’s Anchors, have declared bankruptcy, gone out of business or significantly reduced the number of their retail stores. Store closures by an Anchor may impact the Company’s Centers more holistically by causing other tenants, including Anchors, to terminate their leases, receive reduced rent or cease operating their stores at the Center. 

On October 15, 2018, Sears filed for bankruptcy and announced additional store closings. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, the Company had 21 Sears stores in its portfolio totaling approximately 3.1 million square feet and accounting for less than 1% of the Company’s total leasing revenue. The twenty-one stores included seven owned by the Company, nine owned by the Company’s joint venture with Seritage Growth Properties (“Seritage”), one store that was owned by Sears and four stores that were owned by Seritage. Although, in the short-term, the bankruptcy of an Anchor such as Sears may lead to lost base rent and the triggering of co-tenancy clauses, there is also the potential to create additional future value through the recapturing of space and releasing that space to new tenants at higher rent per square foot, which the Company has demonstrated through its joint venture with Seritage and the completed redevelopment of a former Sears store at Kings Plaza Shopping Center in July 2018.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company recaptured ten Sears locations, including seven through its joint venture with Seritage, through formal lease rejections and lease terminations. The Company currently anticipates aggregate redevelopment investments at several of these locations of $130.0 million to $160.0 million (at the Company's pro rata share) over the next several years. New tenants are expected to open at several projects in 2020. In early 2020, Sears will be closing five additional locations, including three stores in which the Company has an ownership interest and two that are owned by Seritage and not by the Company. Sears will continue to pay rent on these locations in which the Company has an ownership interest. The Company is actively seeking replacement tenants for these Company-owned sites.

On September 29, 2019, Forever 21, Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time of the bankruptcy filing, the Company had 29 Forever 21 stores in its portfolio totaling approximately 1.2 million square feet. As of December 31, 2019, Forever 21 stores represented 1.4% of total minimum and percentage rental revenues of the Company. The Company is in ongoing discussions with Forever 21 regarding the status of those stores. Based on a court filing dated October 28, 2019, the Company expects that four of the Forever 21 stores will close, three of which are owned by the Company (Danbury Fair Mall, Arrowhead Towne Center and Pacific View), and one of which is not owned by the Company (Vintage Faire Mall). The Company anticipates that it may provide certain rent concessions in connection with a number of the remaining stores.The Company is actively seeking replacement tenants for these Company-owned sites.

Comparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 

Revenues:

Leasing revenue decreased by $25.1 million, or 2.8%, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of $18.5 million from the Same Centers, $3.0 million from the JV Transition Center, $2.3 million from the Disposition Property and $1.3 million from the Redevelopment Properties. 

Leasing revenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above and below-market leases increased from $1.9 million in 2018 to $5.2 million in 2019. The amortization of straight-line rents decreased from $11.8 million in 2018 to $10.5 million in 2019. Lease 

47

termination income decreased from $9.9 million in 2018 to $4.6 million in 2019. Leasing revenue also includes a provision for bad debts of $7.7 million in 2019 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). The decrease in leasing revenue at the Same Centers is primarily due to the inclusion of the provision for bad debts in 2019 and a decrease in lease termination income. 

Management Companies' revenue decreased from $43.5 million in 2018 to $40.7 million in 2019. 

 Shopping Center and Operating Expenses:

Shopping center and operating expenses decreased $5.9 million, or 2.1%, from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of $2.0 million from the Same Centers, $1.9 million from the JV Transition Center, $1.2 million from the Disposition Property and $0.8 million from the Redevelopment Properties. The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses at the the Same Centers is primarily due to the exclusion of bad debt expense in 2019 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) offset in part by an increase in property tax expense.

Leasing Expenses:

Leasing expenses increased from $11.6 million in 2018 to $29.6 million in 2019. The increase in leasing expenses is due to the Company's adoption of ASC 842 in 2019 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).

Management Companies' Operating Expenses:

Management Companies' operating expenses decreased $25.1 million from 2018 to 2019. The decrease is attributed to a one-time charge of $12.7 million in connection with the Company's reduction in work force in 2018 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and the subsequent reduction in payroll and share and unit-based compensation costs.

REIT General and Administrative Expenses:

REIT general and administrative expenses decreased $1.5 million from 2018 to 2019 due to a reduction in compensation costs.

Costs Related to Shareholder Activism:

The Company incurred $19.4 million in costs related to shareholder activism in 2018 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and none in 2019.

Depreciation and Amortization:

Depreciation and amortization increased $3.3 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase in depreciation and amortization is primarily attributed to an increase of $5.3 million from the Same Centers offset in part by decreases of $1.3 million from the JV Transition Center and $0.7 million from the Disposition Property.

Interest Expense:

Interest expense decreased $44.7 million from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in interest expense is primarily attributed to decreases of $62.7 million from the Financing Arrangement (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and $1.1 million from the JV Transition Center offset in part by increases of $12.9 million from the Same Centers, $4.4 million from borrowings under the line of credit and $1.8 million from the Redevelopment Properties. 

The decrease in interest expense from the Financing Arrangement is primarily due to the change in fair value of the underlying properties and the mortgage notes payable on the underlying properties. The increase in interest expense at the Same Centers is primarily due to the new loans on Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Chandler Fashion Center, SanTan Village Regional Center and Kings Plaza Shopping Center (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary).

The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which decreased from $15.4 million in 2018 to $9.6 million in 2019.

Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures:

Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased $23.3 million from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the write-down of intangible assets as a result of lease terminations at the Company's joint venture with Seritage in 2019, the gain on the sale of The Market at Estrella Falls in 2018 (See 

48

"Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), the gain on the sale of an ownership interest in an office building at Fashion District Philadelphia in 2018 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and interest expense from the loan placed on Broadway Plaza in 2018 (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary).

Loss on Sale or Write Down of Assets, net:

Loss on sale or write down of assets, net decreased $19.9 million from $31.8 million in 2018 to $11.9 million in 2019. The decrease in loss on sale or write down of assets, net is primarily due to the $54.5 million in impairment losses in 2018 and a $12.0 million decrease in the write down of development costs in 2019 offset in part by the $46.2 million gain on the sale of a 75% ownership interest in One Westside in 2018 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and a $0.6 million decrease in gain on land sales in 2019. The impairment losses were due to the reduction in the estimated holding periods of SouthPark Mall, Promenade at Casa Grande, Southridge Center and two freestanding stores.

Net Income:

Net income increased $33.6 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase in net income is primarily attributed to the decreases of $44.7 million in interest expense and $19.4 million in costs related to shareholder activism offset in part by the decrease of$19.9 million in loss on sale or write down of assets, net, as described above.

Funds From Operations ("FFO"):

Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders—diluted, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold decreased 4.9% from $564.4 million in 2018 to $537.0 million in 2019. For a reconciliation of net income attributable to the Company, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, to FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold and FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders—diluted, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below.

Operating Activities:

Cash provided by operating activities increased $10.8 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase is primarily due to the $19.4 million in costs related to shareholder activism in 2018 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and changes in assets and liabilities and the results as discussed above.

Investing Activities:

Cash used in investing activities increased by $288.3 million from 2018 to 2019. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributed to a decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $270.3 million, a decrease in proceeds from the sale of assets of $80.4 million and an increase in contributions to unconsolidated joint ventures of $71.7 million offset in part by an increase in proceeds from notes receivable of $67.8 million and decreases in development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations of properties of $14.3 million and property improvements of $35.0 million.

The decrease in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the distribution of the Company's share of proceeds from the loans placed on Broadway Plaza and Fashion District Philadelphia (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary) in 2018 and the sale of an ownership interest in an office building at Fashion District Philadelphia (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) in 2018, offset in part by the Company's share of loan proceeds from the new loan on Tysons Tower (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary) in 2019. The increase in proceeds from notes receivable is due to the repayment of the note receivable from the Lennar Corporation in 2019 (See Note 18—Related Party Transactions in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

Financing Activities:

Cash used in financing activities decreased $236.2 million from 2018 to 2019. The decrease in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to an increase in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.4 billion, offset in part by an increase in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of $1.1 billion, the payment on the Financing Arrangement of $27.9 million in 2019 and an increase in dividends and distributions of $20.9 million.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses and debt service and dividend requirements for the next twelve months through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit.

The following tables summarize capital expenditures and lease acquisition costs incurred at the Centers (at the Company's pro rata share) for the years ended December 31:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The Company expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable to 2019 and that capital for those expenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. Although the amounts to be incurred for deferred leasing charges during the next twelve months are expected to be comparable to 2019, the Company began expensing a significant portion of its leasing costs in 2019 in accordance with its adoption of ASC 842 (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). The Company expects to incur between $250 million and $300 million during the next twelve months for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans. 

The Company has also generated liquidity in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, through equity offerings and issuances, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. For example, the Company has generated liquidity through the sales of ownership interests in One Westside and an office building at Fashion District Philadelphia (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), the sales of The Market at Estrella Falls and Promenade at Casa Grande, and the financing of Fashion Outlets of Chicago, Fashion District Philadelphia, Broadway Plaza, SanTan Village Regional Center, Chandler Fashion Center and Tysons Tower (See "Financing Activities" in Management's Overview and Summary). The Company used the proceeds from these transactions to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes. Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts and units that may be sold from time to time by the Company. The Company expects any additional repurchases of the Company's common stock under the 2017 Stock Buyback Program to be funded by future sales of non-core assets, borrowings under its line of credit and/or refinancing transactions.

The capital and credit markets can fluctuate and, at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity as discussed below, the Company has been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. In the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could result in increased borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt, which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future.

52

The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness, which includes mortgages and other notes payable, at December 31, 2019 was $8.1 billion (consisting of $5.2 billion of consolidated debt, less $359.1 million of noncontrolling interests, plus $3.2 billion of its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit or cash on hand.

The Company believes that the pro rata debt provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition because it includes the Company’s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company’s partners’ share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company’s financial condition after taking into account the Company's economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company’s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute for the Company’s total consolidated debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company’s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The Company has a $1.5 billion revolving line of credit facility that bears interest at LIBOR plus a spread of 1.30% to 1.90%, depending on the Company's overall leverage level, and matures on July 6, 2020 with a one-year extension option. The line of credit can be expanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of $2.0 billion. All obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed only by the Company. Based on the Company's leverage level as of December 31, 2019, the borrowing rate on the facility was LIBOR plus 1.55%. The Company has four interest rate swap agreements that effectively convert a total of $400.0 million of the outstanding balance from floating rate debt of LIBOR plus 1.55% to fixed rate debt of 4.30% until September 30, 2021. At December 31, 2019, total borrowings under the line of credit were $820.0 million less unamortized deferred finance costs of $2.6 million with a total interest rate of 3.92%. The Company's availability under the line of credit was $679.7 million at December 31, 2019.

Cash dividends and distributions for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 were $474.5 million. A total of $355.2 million was funded by operations. The remaining $119.4 million was funded from distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures, which were included in the cash flows from investing activities section of the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements.

At December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $100.0 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements:

The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures.

As of December 31, 2019, one of the Company's joint ventures has $150.5 million of debt that could become recourse to the Company, should the joint venture be unable to discharge the obligation of the related debt.

Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, the Company was contingently liable for $40.8 million in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.

53

Contractual Obligations:

The following is a schedule of contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019 for the consolidated Centers over the periods in which they are expected to be paid (in thousands):

Funds From Operations ("FFO")

The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO -diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("Nareit") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.

Beginning during the first quarter of 2018, the Company revised its definition of FFO so that FFO excluded the impact of the financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold. Beginning in 2019, the Company now presents a separate non-GAAP measure - FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold. The Company has revised the FFO presentation for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 to conform to the current presentation. 

The Company accounts for its joint venture in Chandler Freehold as a financing arrangement. In connection with this treatment, the Company recognizes financing expense on (i) the changes in fair value of the financing arrangement obligation, (ii) any payments to the joint venture partner equal to their pro rata share of net income and (iii) any payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income. Only the noted expenses related to the changes in fair value and for the payments to the joint venture partner less than or in excess of their pro rata share of net income are excluded from the measure - FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold.

The Company also presents FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, net and costs related to shareholder activism and unsolicited takeover offer.

FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. In addition, the Company believes that FFO excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, non-routine costs associated with extinguishment of debt and costs related to shareholder activism provide useful supplemental information regarding the Company’s performance as they show a more meaningful and consistent comparison of the Company’s operating performance and allows investors to more easily compare the Company’s results. The Company further believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities.

The Company believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other real estate investment trusts.

Funds From Operations ("FFO") (Continued)

Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of net income to FFO and FFO-diluted. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following reconciles net income attributable to the Company to FFO and FFO-basic and diluted, excluding financing expense in connection with Chandler Freehold, loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt, net and costs related to shareholder activism and unsolicited takeover offer for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015 (dollars and shares in thousands):

(1)Unconsolidated assets are presented at the Company's pro rata share.

(2)Calculated based upon basic net income as adjusted to reach basic FFO. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were 10.4 million, 10.4 million, 10.4 million, 10.7 million and 10.6 million OP Units outstanding, respectively.

(3)The computation of FFO—diluted shares outstanding includes the effect of share and unit-based compensation plans and the convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method. It also assumes the conversion of MACWH, LP common and preferred units to the extent that they are dilutive to the FFO-diluted computation.
