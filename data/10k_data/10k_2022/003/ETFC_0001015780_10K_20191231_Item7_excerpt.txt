ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

OVERVIEW

E*TRADE is a financial services company that provides brokerage and related products and services for traders, investors, stock plan administrators and participants, and RIAs. For additional information related to our business activities see Part 1. Item 1. Business.

Financial Performance

Our net revenue is generated primarily from net interest income, commissions and fees and service charges:

•Net interest income is largely impacted by the size of our balance sheet, our balance sheet mix, and average yields on our assets and liabilities. Net interest income is driven primarily from interest earned on investment securities, margin receivables, securities lending, and our legacy loan portfolio, less interest incurred on interest-bearing liabilities, including deposits, customer payables, corporate debt and other borrowings.

•Commissions revenue is generated by customer trades and is largely impacted by trade volume and trade type. With the elimination of retail commissions for online US listed stock, ETF and options trades, we expect the majority of commissions revenue in future periods will be driven from options contract charges. 

•Fees and service charges revenue is primarily impacted by order flow revenue, fees earned from off-balance sheet customer cash, advisor management and custody fees, and mutual fund service fees.

Our net revenue is offset by non-interest expenses, the largest of which are compensation and benefits and advertising and market development.

Significant Events

Acquired Gradifi, student loan benefit and financial wellness provider

On December 9, 2019, the Company completed its acquisition of Gradifi, a student loan benefit and financial wellness provider, for a purchase price of $30 million. The acquisition is expected to enhance the Company's Corporate Services offering through its comprehensive suite of financial wellness solutions which is expected to complement the Company's leading stock plan administration services. Refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring for additional information. 

Completed $1 billion share repurchase program; progress made on $1.5 billion program

The Company repurchased 10.8 million shares for $499 million during 2019 to complete repurchases under its previous $1 billion share repurchase program which was announced in October 2018. The Company also repurchased 14.0 million shares for $586 million during 2019 under its $1.5 billion share repurchase program which was announced in July 2019. As of February 14, 2020, we have subsequently repurchased approximately 1.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $44.02 per share.

Table of Contents 

We expect to continue share repurchases in 2020; however, we retain flexibility to deploy capital in the most accretive way possible.

Eliminated commission rates for equity and options trades

On October 2, 2019, we announced the elimination of retail commissions for online US listed stock, ETF and options trades. We also reduced the options contract charge to $0.65 per contract for all traders while maintaining our active trader pricing at $0.50 per contract. The Company estimated that the annual revenue impact of these changes, which became effective on October 7, 2019, would be approximately $300 million based on operating results in the second quarter of 2019. We expect the majority of commissions revenue in future periods will be driven from options contract charges. 

Rated #1 online broker in Kiplinger's annual Best Online Brokers review

In August 2019, E*TRADE was awarded first place overall and "Best for Mutual Fund Investors" in Kiplinger's annual Best Online Brokers Review of 10 firms across seven categories. We also received high marks for user experience, investment choices, advisory services, and mobile as part of the review. 

Generated additional capital capacity by repositioning balance sheet

The Company sold $4.5 billion of lower-yielding investment securities, enabling the reduction of the size of our balance sheet during the three months ended June 30, 2019. Gains (losses) on securities and other, net includes $80 million of losses related to these sales. During the second quarter, the Company moved $6.6 billion of deposits to third-party banks, generating additional capital capacity to support share repurchases. The Company's balance sheet repositioning prioritized longer-term growth in earnings per share and capital return to shareholders over short-term revenue growth and operating margin. See MD&A—Earnings Overview, MD&A—Balance Sheet Overview and Note 6—Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Securities for additional information.

Key Performance Metrics

Management monitors customer activity and corporate metrics to evaluate the Company’s performance. The most significant of these are displayed below. During 2019, the Company updated the structure of its customer activity metrics to better align to its retail and institutional channels. Additionally, the Company has updated the presentation of certain customer activity metrics, as follows:

•Customer-directed trades: The definition of trades was updated in November 2019 to reflect all customer-directed trades. This includes trades associated with no-transaction-fee mutual funds, options trades through the Dime Buyback Program, and all ETF transactions, including those that were formerly classified as commission-free. This update was as a result of the commissions reduction announced on October 2, 2019 and impacts daily average revenue trades (DARTs), derivative DARTs, and derivative DARTs percentage.

•Customer accounts: The definition of accounts was updated during the first quarter of 2019 to align the minimum threshold for gross new and end of period retail accounts to $25. The definition for gross new retail accounts sourced from Corporate Services was also updated to include only those accounts which maintain a minimum balance of $25 at the end of the reporting period or trade within the reporting period.

These updates have been reflected in the customer activity metrics for all periods presented and did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements.

Customer Activity Metrics

Daily Average Revenue Trades is an important measure of customer trading activity, and is a key driver of trading-based revenue. DARTs were 291,023, 274,997 and 209,296 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Derivative DARTs, a key component of overall DARTs that represents advanced trading activities by our customers, is the daily average number of options and futures trades, and Derivative DARTs percentage is the mix of options and futures trades as a component of total DARTs. Derivative DARTs were 97,912, 91,543 and 65,525 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Derivative DARTs represented 34%, 33% and 31% of total DARTs for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect options trades will be the primary driver of commissions revenue in future periods.

Margin receivables represent credit extended to customers to finance their purchases of securities by borrowing against securities they own and is a key driver of net interest income. Margin receivables were $9.7 billion, $9.6 billion and $9.1 billion at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net new retail and advisor services assets equals total inflows to new and existing retail and advisor services accounts less total outflows from closed and existing retail and advisor services accounts. The net new retail and advisor services assets metric is a general indicator of the use of our products and services by new and existing retail and advisor services customers. Net new retail and advisor services assets exclude the effects of market movements in the value of retail and advisor services assets. Net new retail and advisor services assets were $14.8 billion, $49.7 billion and $11.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The following table presents annualized net new retail and advisor services assets growth rates:

Corporate Metrics:

Diluted earnings per common share is the portion of a company's profit allocated to each diluted share of common stock and is a key indicator of the Company's profitability. Diluted earnings per common share was $3.85, $3.88 and $2.15 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Operating margin is the percentage of net revenue that results in income before income taxes and is an indicator of the Company's profitability. Operating margin was 46%, 49% and 45% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Adjusted operating margin is a non-GAAP measure that provides useful information about our ongoing operating performance by excluding the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt, which are not viewed as key factors governing our investment in the business and are excluded by management when evaluating operating margin performance. Adjusted operating margin was 44%, 47% and 40% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See MD&A—Earnings Overview for a reconciliation of adjusted operating margin to operating margin.

Capital return to shareholders represents the amount of earnings returned to shareholders through share repurchases and common stock dividends and Capital return percentage to shareholders is capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of net income available to common shareholders. Capital return to shareholders was $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $362 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Capital return percentage to shareholders was 133%, 116% and 61% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company's balance sheet repositioning in the second quarter 2019 generated additional capital to support share repurchases. In addition, the Company also returned capital to shareholders in the form of shares withheld for taxes of $20 million, $28 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Return on common equity is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity, which excludes preferred stock. Return on common equity was 16%, 17% and 10% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

Adjusted return on common equity is a non-GAAP measure calculated by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity, which excludes preferred stock. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders is a non-GAAP measure which excludes the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt, which are not viewed as key factors governing our investment in the business and are excluded by management when evaluating return on common equity performance. Adjusted return on common equity was 15%, 16% and 9% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See MD&A—Earnings Overview for a reconciliation of adjusted net income available to common shareholders to net income and adjusted return on common equity to return on common equity. 

Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents and represents the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Cash and equivalents was $750 million, $2.3 billion and $931 million at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, while corporate cash was $645 million, $391 million and $541 million for the same periods. See MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources for a reconciliation of corporate cash to cash and equivalents.

Average interest-earning assets, along with net interest margin, are indicators of our ability to generate net interest income. Average interest-earning assets were $58.2 billion, $60.0 billion and $53.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Net interest margin is a measure of the net yield on our average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin is calculated for a given period by dividing the annualized sum of net interest income by average interest-earning assets. Net interest margin was 3.18%, 3.08% and 2.79% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Tier 1 leverage ratio is an indicator of capital adequacy for E*TRADE Financial and E*TRADE Bank. Tier 1 leverage ratio is Tier 1 capital divided by adjusted average assets for leverage capital purposes. E*TRADE Financial's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 6.9%, 6.6% and 7.4% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. E*TRADE Bank's Tier 1 leverage ratio was 7.2%, 7.1% and 7.6% at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

EARNINGS OVERVIEW

We generated net income of $955 million on total net revenue of $2.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The following chart presents a reconciliation of net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 to net income for the year ended December 31, 2019 (dollars in millions):

(1)Includes advertising and market development, clearing and servicing, professional services, depreciation and amortization, losses on early extinguishment of debt and other non-interest expenses.

Table of Contents 

The following table presents significant components of the consolidated statements of income (dollars in millions, except per share amounts):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net income decreased 9% to $955 million or $3.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 71% to $1.1 billion, or $3.88 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Net income available to common shareholders was $915 million, $1.0 billion, and $589 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, which includes preferred stock dividends of $40 million, $36 million, and $25 million in the same periods, respectively. 

•The decrease in net income during 2019 was primarily driven by higher non-interest expense due to increased compensation and benefits expenses, restructuring and acquisition-related activities, and other non-interest expenses partially offset by decreases in communications and FDIC insurance premiums expenses as compared to 2018. Lower benefit for loan losses also contributed to the decrease in net income, which was partially offset by higher net revenue. 

•The increase in net income during 2018 was driven by higher interest income due to a larger average balance sheet, an improvement in net interest margin, higher commissions due to increased trading activity, higher fees and service charges and net gains on securities and other as compared to 2017. Lower losses on early extinguishment of debt also contributed to increased net income in 2018. During the year ended December 31, 2018, these increases were partially offset by a lower benefit for loan losses and higher non-interest expense due primarily to increased compensation and benefits and advertising and market development expense.

(1)Calculated by dividing net income by average total shareholders’ equity. As described in the Earnings Overview section below, the Company's return on common equity corporate metric is calculated by dividing net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity, which excludes preferred stock.

(2)Calculated by dividing dividends declared per common share by basic earnings per share.

Average interest-earning assets decreased 3% to $58.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to 2018. The fluctuation in interest-earning assets is generally driven by changes in interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and customer payables. Average interest-bearing liabilities decreased 1% to $55.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 due to the following: 

•Deposits and customer payables: The decrease in sweep deposits was primarily driven by the balance sheet repositioning during the second quarter of 2019, as we moved $6.6 billion of deposits to third-party banks. The increase in savings deposits was primarily driven by the growth in the Premium Savings Account balances during the year, which was partially offset by the conversion of Premium Savings Accounts into a sweep deposit program beginning in November 2019. Refer to MD&A—Balance Sheet Overview for additional information.

•Other interest-bearing liabilities: The decrease in broker-related payables and other borrowings was driven by customer activity and short-term liquidity needs at E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities. In addition, net proceeds from the June 2018 issuance of corporate debt were used to redeem the Company's trust preferred securities in the third quarter of 2018, resulting in a decrease in other borrowings and an offsetting increase to corporate debt as compared to 2018.

Net interest margin increased 10 basis points to 3.18% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. Net interest margin is driven by the mix of average asset and liability balances and the interest rates earned or paid on those balances. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018, is due to higher interest rates earned on margin receivables, investment securities, and loans balances as well as higher securities lending revenues, partially offset by increased funding costs due to increased rates paid on deposits, including the Premium Savings Account product. The increase in rates was largely driven by the four increases in federal funds rates that occurred during 2018 partially offset by the three federal funds rate cuts during 2019. Our net interest margin was also impacted by the continued run-off of our higher yielding legacy loan portfolio.

Average interest-earning assets increased 13% to $60.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The fluctuation in interest-earning assets is generally driven by changes in interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits and customer payables. Average interest-bearing liabilities increased 12% to $56.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was driven by higher sweep deposits during 2018 and deposits assumed as part of the acquisition of TCA and retail brokerage accounts from Capital One, partially offset by customer net buying of $13.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net buying of $9.2 billion during the same period in 2017.

Net interest margin increased 29 basis points to 3.08% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. Net interest margin is driven by the mix of average asset and liability balances and the interest rates earned or paid on those balances. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017 is due to higher interest rates earned on higher margin receivables and investment securities balances, partially offset by the continued run-off of our higher yielding legacy mortgage and consumer loan portfolio. Additionally, funding costs increased primarily due to increased rates paid on deposits, customer payables, and broker-related payables during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Commissions

Commissions revenue decreased 15% to $421 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 13% to $498 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease during 2019 was primarily related to the elimination of retail commissions which was effective on October 7, 2019. The primary factors that affect commissions revenue are DARTs, derivative DARTs, trade type, and the number of trading days. We expect the majority of commissions revenue in future periods will be driven from options contract charges. For additional information see MD&A—Overview.

DARTs volume increased 6% to 291,023 for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 31% to 274,997 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. DARTs volume is impacted by market sentiment as well as volatility of the equity markets. Derivative DARTs volume increased 7% to 97,912 for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and increased 40% to 91,543 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. 

Fees and Service Charges

The following table presents the significant components of fees and service charges (dollars in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes revenue earned on average customer cash held by third parties based on the federal funds rate or LIBOR plus a negotiated spread or other contractual arrangements with the third-party institutions.

Fees and service charges increased 36% to $588 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and 17% to $431 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by higher average off-balance sheet money market and sweep deposits balances as a result of the balance sheet repositioning in June 2019 and a higher yield of approximately 175 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 140 basis points in 2018 and 90 basis points in 2017. In both 2019 and 2018 order flow revenue increased driven by higher trade volume and advisor management and custody fees increased as a result of the acquisition of TCA in the second quarter of 2018. The increase in order flow revenue and advisor management and custody fees in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by decreased money market funds and sweep deposits revenue driven by lower average customer cash balances held by third parties as a result of transferring cash onto our balance sheet.

(3)Includes a $5 million gain on the sale of our Chicago Stock Exchange investment for the year ended December 31, 2018.

(4)Includes losses of $14 million on hedge ineffectiveness for the year ended December 31, 2017. Beginning January 1, 2018, fair value hedging adjustments are recognized within net interest income. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

Provision (Benefit) for Loan Losses

We recognized a benefit for loan losses of $51 million, $86 million and $168 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The timing and magnitude of the provision (benefit) for loan losses is affected by many factors that could result in variability. These benefits reflected better than expected performance of our legacy loan portfolio as well as recoveries in excess of prior expectations, including sales of charged-off loans and recoveries of previous charge-offs that were not included in our loss estimates. For additional information on management's estimate of the allowance for loan losses, see Note 7—Loans Receivable, Net.

Non-Interest Expense

The following table presents the significant components of non-interest expense (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expense increased 8% to $670 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and 14% to $621 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The expense increase during 2019 was primarily driven by higher compensation expense, insurance benefit and payroll taxes due to an increase in average headcount as compared to the prior year and an executive transition in the third quarter of 2019. The expense increase during 2018 was primarily driven by a 12% increase in headcount as a result of the TCA acquisition and to support the onboarding of the retail brokerage accounts from Capital One, as well as other growth in our business.

Advertising and Market Development

Advertising and market development expense decreased 2% to $196 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and increased 20% to $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The expense decrease during 2019 was driven by lower media and brand production spend as compared to prior period. The planned expense increase during 2018 was primarily due to higher media and brand production spend resulting from our focus on increasing engagement across new and existing customers.

Clearing and Servicing

Clearing and servicing expense increased 6% to $133 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and 2% to $126 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The expense increase during 2019 was primarily due to higher fees driven by increased trading volume and higher average off-balance sheet customer cash balances held by third parties, partially offset by lower loan servicing fees due to the run-off of our legacy loan portfolio. The expense increase during 2018 was primarily due to increased fees driven by increased trading volume, partially offset by lower loan servicing fees and decreased fees due to lower customer cash balances held by third parties.

Professional Services

Professional services expense increased 9% to $105 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and decreased 3% to $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The expense increase during 2019 includes continued investment in projects to drive operational efficiencies and expand our business capabilities. The expense decrease during 2018 was primarily driven by lower legal services expense.

Occupancy and Equipment

Occupancy and equipment expense increased 9% to $135 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and 7% to $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The expense increase during both periods was primarily driven by higher software licenses and facilities expense.

Communications

Communications expense decreased 15% to $99 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and 4% to $116 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease during both periods was primarily driven by lower market data expenses. Communications expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 included a $14 million benefit related to a change in estimate for previous market data usage.

FDIC Insurance Premiums

FDIC insurance premiums expense decreased 53% to $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 and 3% to $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decreases were driven by the termination of surcharges paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund after it attained the minimum reserve ratio of 1.35 percent of insured deposits in September 2018, and our balance sheet repositioning during the second quarter 2019 when we moved $6.6 billion of deposits to third-party banks.

Amortization of Other Intangibles

Amortization of other intangibles increased 27% to $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and 33% to $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase during 2019 related primarily to a full year of amortization associated with the intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisition of TCA and the acquisition of retail accounts from Capital One during 2018, which also contributed to the increase from 2017. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring for additional information.

Restructuring and Acquisition-Related Activities

Restructuring and acquisition-related activities expense was $23 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to $7 million and $15 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Restructuring and acquisition-related activities expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 related primarily to expenses incurred as part of the closure of our New York headquarters, severance from organizational changes driven by enterprise-wide cost containment initiatives, and costs incurred as part of the Gradifi acquisition. Refer to Note 2—Acquisitions and Restructuring and Note 19—Lease Arrangements for additional information. Restructuring and acquisition-related activities expense for the years ended December 31, 2018 included costs incurred in connection with the restructuring of our regulatory and enterprise risk management functions due to bank regulatory reform and the closing of the TCA acquisition. Restructuring and acquisition-related activities expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 related primarily to costs incurred in connection with the integration of OptionsHouse.

Losses on Early Extinguishment of Debt

There were no losses on early extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2019. Losses on early extinguishment of debt were $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $58 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. 

•During the third quarter of 2018, we used the net proceeds from the June 2018 issuance of Senior Notes to redeem all $413 million of our outstanding trust preferred securities (TRUPs). In connection with the redemption, we recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $4 million. 

•During the third quarter of 2017, we issued $600 million of 2.95% Senior Notes due 2022 and $400 million of 3.80% Senior Notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds, along with existing corporate cash, to redeem our outstanding $540 million of 5.375% Senior Notes and $460 million of 4.625% Senior Notes, which resulted in a $58 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.

Other Non-Interest Expenses

Other non-interest expenses increased 22% to $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018 and 1% to $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase during 2019 was primarily driven by $8 million impairment of certain technology assets and increased franchise taxes. Refer to Note 9—Property and Equipment, Net for additional information.

Operating Margin

Operating margin was 46% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 49% and 45% for the same periods in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Adjusted operating margin, a non-GAAP measure, was 44% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 47% and 40% for the same periods in 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Adjusted operating margin is calculated by dividing adjusted income before income tax expense by total net revenue. Adjusted income before income tax expense, a non-GAAP measure, excludes provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt. The following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted income before income tax expense and adjusted operating margin, non-GAAP measures, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures (dollars in millions):

Return on common equity was 16% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 17% and 10% for the same periods in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Adjusted return on common equity, a non-GAAP measure, was 15% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 16% and 9% for 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Adjusted return on common equity is calculated by dividing adjusted net income available to common shareholders by average common shareholders' equity, which excludes preferred stock. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders, a non-GAAP measure, excludes the after-tax impact of the provision (benefit) for loan losses and losses on early extinguishment of debt.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense was $364 million, $366 million and $450 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate was 27.6%, 25.8% and 42.2% respectively, for the same periods. 

•The effective tax rate of 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes additional tax expense related primarily to the remeasurement of net state deferred taxes.

•The effective tax rate of 25.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 included the new statutory federal income tax rate of 21% which was effective January 1, 2018 as well as a slight benefit related to the remeasurement of certain net state deferred tax assets and the accounting for employee share-based compensation.

•The effective tax rate of 42.2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) that was enacted on December 22, 2017. This resulted in a reduction in the value of our net federal deferred tax assets using the new statutory federal corporate income tax rate of 21%. As a result, we recognized $58 million of additional tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. The effective tax rate also includes the impact of adopting amended accounting guidance for employee share-based compensation.

BALANCE SHEET OVERVIEW

The following table presents the significant components of the consolidated balance sheet (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash and Equivalents

Cash and equivalents decreased 68% to $750 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. Cash and equivalents will fluctuate based on a variety of factors, including, among other drivers, liquidity needs at the parent, customer activity at our regulated subsidiaries, and the timing of investments at E*TRADE Bank. For additional information on our use of cash and equivalents, see MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Segregated Cash

Cash segregated under federal or other regulations increased 86% to $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. The level of segregated cash is driven by customer payables and securities lending balances we hold as liabilities compared with the amount of margin receivables and securities borrowed balances we hold as assets. The excess represents customer cash that we segregate for the exclusive benefit of our brokerage customers. Segregated cash can also be impacted by the level of securities purchased under agreements to resell between E*TRADE Securities and E*TRADE Bank, representing investments that were also segregated under federal or other regulations by E*TRADE Securities and eliminated in consolidation, which increased $1.5 billion to $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.

(1)Includes non-agency asset-backed securities (ABS) and non-agency commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Securities represented 68% and 69% of total assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We classify debt securities as available-for-sale or held-to-maturity based on our investment strategy and management’s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the debt securities until maturity. 

The decrease in available-for-sale securities during the year ended December 31, 2019 related primarily to the sale of $4.5 billion of lower-yielding investment securities as part of the Company's balance sheet repositioning in June 2019 and the transfer of Securities with a fair value of $744 million from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity based on a change in intent and demonstrated ability to hold them to maturity in December 2019.

Loans receivable, net decreased 24% to $1.6 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019 on continued paydowns and the sale of our consumer loan portfolio in December 2019. We expect the remaining legacy mortgage loan portfolio to continue its run-off for the foreseeable future. As our portfolio has seasoned and substantially all interest-only loans have converted to amortizing, we continue to assess underlying performance, the economic environment, and the value of the portfolio in the marketplace. While it is our intention to continue to hold these loans, our strategy could change subject to market conditions.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Percentage not meaningful.

Securities borrowed increased to $1.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by increased cash available and continued demand for cash from our counterparties. The 46% decrease in receivables from clearing organizations during the year ended December 31, 2019 to $297 million was primarily driven by the decreased use of cash collateral for the Company's derivatives transactions utilized for hedging activities.

Securities loaned decreased 6% to $838 million during the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower demand for securities from our counterparties. For additional information on E*TRADE Securities liquidity, see MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Other Assets

Other assets increased 45% to $1.4 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was driven by $200 million of securities purchased under agreements to resell that were outstanding at the end of the period and $195 million of operating lease assets related to the Company's adoption of the new guidance on accounting for leases in 2019. See Note 19—Lease Arrangements for additional information.

The following table presents the significant components of deposits (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Beginning November 2019, bank sweep deposits include Premium Savings Accounts participating in the newly established bank sweep deposit account program. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Deposits represented 70% and 78% of total liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in deposits during the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily driven by the balance sheet repositioning during the second quarter 2019, partially offset by growth in our Premium Savings Account product. 

We offer the following sweep deposit account programs to customers which utilize our bank subsidiaries, in combination with additional third-party program banks, as applicable:

•Extended insurance sweep deposit account (ESDA) program

•Retirement sweep deposit account (RSDA) program for retirement plan customers

•Cash balance program offered by E*TRADE Savings Bank for uninvested cash held in eligible custodial accounts as part of the advisor services offering launched in connection with the TCA acquisition

•Bank sweep deposit account program offered by E*TRADE Bank for Premium Savings Account holders 

Our sweep deposit programs are designed to offer up to $1.25 million in FDIC coverage for individual accounts ($2.5 million for joint accounts). The bank sweep deposit program, which launched in November 2019, provides the Company with the ability to transfer amounts held on deposit in E*TRADE Bank Premium Savings Accounts to an FDIC-insured account at one or more participating banks if desired. As the bank sweep deposit program was established to allow for reciprocal deposits, E*TRADE Bank may also accept deposits from customers of the participating third-party banks. Bank sweep deposits included $1.0 billion of reciprocal deposits received from third-party banks at December 31, 2019. See MD&A—Earnings Overview, Note 6—Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Securities, and Note 12—Deposits for additional information.

As of December 31, 2019, approximately 98% of sweep deposits were in these programs. Sweep deposits on balance sheet are held at bank subsidiaries and are included in the deposits line item on our consolidated balance sheet.

Other Liabilities

Other liabilities increased 70% to $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2019.

See Note 19—Lease Arrangements for additional information.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We have established liquidity and capital policies to support the successful execution of our business strategy, while maintaining ongoing and sufficient liquidity through the business cycle. We believe liquidity is of critical importance to the Company and especially important for E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities. The objective of our policies is to ensure that we can meet our corporate, banking and broker-dealer liquidity needs under both normal operating conditions and under periods of stress in the financial markets.

Liquidity

Our liquidity needs are primarily driven by capital needs at E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities, interest due on our corporate debt, dividend payments on our preferred stock and other capital returns to holders of our common stock. Our banking and brokerage subsidiaries' liquidity needs are driven primarily by the level and volatility of our customer activity. Management maintains a set of liquidity sources and monitors certain business trends and market metrics closely in an effort to ensure we have sufficient liquidity. Potential loans by E*TRADE Bank or E*TRADE Savings Bank to the parent company or the parent company's other non-bank subsidiaries are subject to various quantitative, arm’s length, collateralization, capital and other requirements.

Parent Company Liquidity

The parent company's primary source of liquidity is corporate cash. Corporate cash, a non-GAAP measure, is a component of cash and equivalents; see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for information on cash and equivalents activity. We define corporate cash as cash held at the parent company and subsidiaries, excluding bank, broker-dealer, and FCM subsidiaries that require regulatory approval or notification prior to the payment of certain dividends to the parent company. Corporate cash includes the parent company's deposits placed with E*TRADE Bank. E*TRADE Bank may use these deposits for investment purposes; however, these investments are not included in consolidated cash and equivalents.

We believe corporate cash is a useful measure of the parent company’s liquidity as it is the primary source of capital above and beyond the capital deployed in our regulated subsidiaries. Corporate cash is monitored as part of our liquidity risk management. Our current corporate cash target is $300 million and covers approximately 18 months of parent company fixed costs, which include corporate overhead costs, preferred stock dividends, corporate debt interest, and, as applicable, contractual corporate debt maturities over the next 12 months. Parent company fixed costs are defined as minimum expenditures required to operate the business and exclude controllable, or variable costs. The Company maintains additional liquidity through a $300 million unsecured committed revolving credit facility. The parent has the ability to borrow against the credit facility for working capital and general corporate purposes. Dividends from our operating subsidiaries, including E*TRADE Bank and E*TRADE Securities, are additional sources of corporate cash. Subject to regulatory approval or notification, capital generated by these subsidiaries could be distributed to the parent company to the extent the excess capital levels exceed both regulatory capital requirements and internal capital thresholds. As of December 31, 2019, our subsidiaries maintained excess regulatory capital over internal thresholds and paid dividends of $1.7 billion to the parent company during the year ended December 31, 2019.

Table of Contents 

Corporate cash increased $254 million to $645 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the following:

•$1.7 billion of dividends received from bank and brokerage subsidiaries

•$1.1 billion used for share repurchases

•$175 million used for dividends, including $135 million in common stock dividends and $40 million in preferred stock dividends

•$121 million used primarily for parent company overhead, including both fixed and variable costs, less reimbursements from subsidiaries under cost sharing arrangements and the impact of cash activity at other non-regulated subsidiaries

•$52 million used for corporate debt activity

•$29 million used for the acquisition of Gradifi

•$29 million used for income tax payments, net of refunds and subsidiary reimbursements

E*TRADE Bank Liquidity

E*TRADE Bank, including its subsidiary E*TRADE Savings Bank, relies primarily on deposits for liquidity needs. Management believes that within deposits, sweep deposits are of particular importance as they are a stable source of liquidity for E*TRADE Bank. The vast majority of E*TRADE Bank's liquidity is invested in securities backed by the US government or its agencies, representing highly liquid securities with low credit risk. 

We may also utilize wholesale funding sources for short-term liquidity and contingency funding requirements. Our ability to borrow these funds is dependent upon the continued availability of funding in the wholesale borrowings market. In addition, we can borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond's discount window to meet short-term liquidity requirements, although it is not viewed as a primary source of funding. At December 31, 2019, E*TRADE Bank had $6.8 billion and $1.3 billion in collateralized borrowing capacity with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, respectively.

E*TRADE Securities Liquidity

E*TRADE Securities relies primarily on customer payables and securities lending to provide liquidity and to fund margin lending. E*TRADE Securities maintains additional liquidity through external lines of credit totaling approximately $1.3 billion. E*TRADE Securities also maintains lines of credit with the parent company and E*TRADE Bank.

For additional information on our broker-dealer and FCM capital requirements, refer to Note 18—Regulatory Requirements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We enter into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of our customers and to reduce our own exposure to interest rate risk. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, we enter into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For additional information on these arrangements, refer to Note 20—Commitments, Contingencies and Other Regulatory Matters.

(2)Includes future minimum lease payments for non-cancelable operating leases, including a sale-leaseback that is accounted for as a financing, with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year, net of sublease proceeds.

(3)Includes material purchase obligations for goods and services covered by non-cancelable contracts and obligations through the contractual termination date for cancelable contracts. Includes contracts through the termination date, even if the contract is renewable.

(4)Includes annual interest based on the contractual features of each security, using market rates at December 31, 2019. Interest rates are assumed to remain at current levels over the life of all adjustable rate instruments.

(5)Does not include sweep deposits, savings deposits, money market or checking deposits as there are no stated maturity dates and/or scheduled contractual payments.

The Company also had $43 million in unfunded contingent investment commitments to partnerships, companies and other similar entities, including tax credit partnerships and community development entities, which are not required to be consolidated, at December 31, 2019.

RISK MANAGEMENT

The identification, mitigation and management of existing and potential risks is critical to effective enterprise risk management. There are certain risks inherent to our industry (e.g. execution of transactions) and certain risks that will surface through the conduct of our business operations. We seek to monitor and manage our significant risk exposures by operating under a set of Board-approved limits and by monitoring certain risk indicators. Our governance framework is designed to comply with applicable requirements and requires regular reporting on metrics and significant risks and exposures to senior management and the board of directors.

We have a Board-approved Enterprise Risk Appetite Statement (RAS) that is provided to all employees. The RAS specifies significant risk exposures and addresses the Company's tolerance of those risks, which are categorized as follows, with further information provided below:

•Credit Risk—the risk of loss arising from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its credit obligations

•Liquidity Risk—the potential inability to meet in a timely and cost-effective manner contractual and contingent financial obligations, either on- or off-balance sheet, as they come due

•Market Risk—the risk that asset values or income streams will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions

•Operational Risk—the risk of losses or near misses due to failure of people, processes, and systems, or damage to physical assets

•Strategic Risk—the risk of loss of market size, market share, capital or margin in our business, leading to lost revenues and potentially significant reductions to net income, assets, and/or market value

•Reputational Risk—the potential that negative perceptions regarding our conduct or business practices or capacity to conduct business will adversely affect valuation, profitability, operations, or the customer base, or require costly litigation or other measures

•Legal and Regulatory Risk—the risk to earnings or capital arising from violations of, or non-conformance with, laws, rules, regulations, applicable guidance, internal policies, or ethical standards, as well as uncertainties surrounding the interpretation or application of laws. Legal and regulatory risk also arises in situations where the rules governing certain related products or activities may be ambiguous, untested, or in the process of significant change or revision.

We are also subject to other risks that could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in future periods. For additional information see Part I. Item 1A.— Risk Factors.

We manage risk through a governance structure of risk committees, which consist of members of senior management, to help ensure that business decisions are executed within our stated risk profile and consistent with the RAS. A variety of methodologies and measures are used to monitor, quantify, assess and forecast risk. Measurement criteria, methodologies and calculations are reviewed periodically to ensure that risks are represented appropriately. Certain risks are described in the RAS and related policies which establish processes and limits. The RAS and these policies are reviewed, challenged, and approved by certain risk committees and/or the board of directors, where applicable, at least annually.

The Risk Oversight Committee (ROC), which consists of independent members of the board of directors, reviews, challenges and approves the RAS and certain risk policies each year, receives regular reports on the status of certain limits and Key Risk Indicators and discusses certain key risks. In addition to this Board-level committee, various management committees and subcommittees throughout the Company aid in the identification, measurement and management of risks, including but not limited to:

E*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 63

Table of Contents 

•Enterprise Risk Management Committee (ERMC)—the ERMC is the senior-most risk management committee and has primary responsibility for approving risk limits and monitoring risk management activities. The ERMC also resolves issues escalated by the other risk management committees and in certain instances approves exceptions to risk policies

•Asset Liability Committee (ALCO)—the ALCO has primary responsibility for monitoring of market, interest rate, and liquidity risk, and approves related risk limits or recommends related risk limits to be approved by the ERMC

•Credit Committee—the Credit Committee has responsibility for approving credit programs, including those supporting margin lending, investments in credit sensitive assets, loan modifications and securities-based lending. The Credit Committee also has responsibility for developing credit risk limits and submitting them to the ERMC for approval

•Operational Risk and Control Committee (ORCC)—the ORCC has responsibility for the oversight and management of the operational risks in all business lines, legal entities, and departments, including the development and reporting of key operational risk metrics. The ORCC has oversight of operational risk management in the existing enterprise risk categories, including: transactions execution risk, information security (e.g. cyber security) and other security risks, legal and regulatory risks, systems and information technology risks, and employment risks

•Technology Risk Committee (TRC)—the TRC provides oversight to ensure that all information technology, including information security, objectives and requirements are met and that policies, programs and plans are implemented

Credit Risk Management

We have expanded our credit risk appetite to include purchases of non-agency securities within risk limits. We face credit risks as follows:

•We hold credit risk exposure in our legacy loan portfolio and in connection with our investments in non-agency commercial mortgage-backed and non-agency ABS 

•We offer securities-based lending products and margin loans to our customers which leads to the risk of credit losses in the event a customer's assets decline due to adverse market conditions, leaving the account with an unsecured debit that the customer is not able or willing to cover

•We engage in financial transactions with counterparties, which expose us to counterparty credit losses or collateral losses in the event a counterparty cannot meet its obligations. These financial transactions include our invested cash, securities lending, repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements, and derivatives portfolios, as well as the settlement of trades.

Credit risk is monitored by the Credit Committee. The Credit Committee's objective is to evaluate current and expected credit performance of our loans, investments, borrowers and counterparties relative to market conditions and the probable impact on our financial performance. It establishes credit risk guidelines in accordance with our strategic objectives and existing policies, and reviews investment and lending activities with credit risk to ensure consistency with those established guidelines. These reviews involve an analysis of portfolio balances, delinquencies, losses, recoveries, default management and collateral liquidation performance, as well as any credit risk mitigation efforts relating to the portfolios. In addition, the Credit Committee reviews and approves credit related counterparties engaged in financial transactions with us. The Credit Committee is responsible for corporate governance and oversight with regard to margin risk. The Credit Committee identifies, monitors and mitigates where necessary market, operational and credit risks related to our margin lending activities.

Loss Mitigation on the Loan Portfolio

Our credit risk team manages the mitigation of credit risk within the loan portfolio. We continue to have loan modification programs that were established to minimize potential losses in the mortgage portfolios by targeting borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, these programs were utilized to modify $9 million and $15 million, respectively, of one- to four-family loans, and $4 million and $5 million, respectively, of home equity loans. These modifications were classified as troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). We also process minor modifications on certain loans in the normal course of servicing delinquent accounts. Minor modifications resulting in an insignificant delay in the timing of payments are not considered economic concessions and therefore are not classified as TDRs. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $5 million and $7 million, respectively, of mortgage loans with minor modifications that were not considered TDRs. 

Currently, our entire mortgage loan portfolio is serviced by third parties. To reduce vendor, operational and regulatory risks, we have assessed our servicing relationships and, where appropriate, consolidated providers or transferred certain mortgage loans to servicers that specialize in managing troubled assets. At December 31, 2019, $981 million gross unpaid principal balance of our mortgage loans were held at servicers that specialize in managing troubled assets. We believe this initiative has improved and will continue to improve the credit performance of the loans transferred compared to the expected credit performance of these same loans if they had not been transferred. 

Liquidity Risk Management

Liquidity risk is monitored by the ALCO, the ERMC and the ROC. Liquidity risk arises in a number of key areas: 

•Negative news affecting the financial services and banking sector, in general, could have a systemic liquidity impact

•Significant concerns about our solvency or liquidity position could cause idiosyncratic liquidity stress 

•Increases in short term rates could cause deposit outflow and funding pressure 

•The parent company has no revenue sources other than dividends from its subsidiaries to fund corporate debt obligations, which introduces additional liquidity concerns

•Our corporate debt covenants and restrictions could impact our ability to distribute capital or obtain additional debt financing

We have in place a comprehensive set of liquidity and funding policies as well as contingency funding plans that are intended to maintain our flexibility to address liquidity events specific to us or the market in general. See MD&A—Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information.

Market Risk Management

The most significant type of market risk we face is interest rate risk. Interest rate risk is the risk of adverse changes in earnings or market value arising from our balance sheet position due to changes in interest rates. We face interest rate risk in the following areas: 

•A large proportion of our balance sheet is actively invested in MBS, agency notes, and other federal government obligations, which are subject to income and market value changes due to changes in interest rates and spreads 

•We hold a sizable amount of customer deposits, which can be sensitive to the offer rate and/or the stock market environment 

E*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 65

Table of Contents 

•Our margin customers (inclusive of futures and options customers) are subject to market risk when an account’s value declines due to market conditions 

Market risk is monitored by the Credit Committee, the ALCO, the ERMC and the ROC. The ALCO monitors current and expected market conditions and their probable impact on the Company and provides oversight for interest rate risk. Risks associated with the margin portfolio are reviewed monthly by the Credit Committee. See Part II. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk for additional information about our market risks.

Operational Risk Management

Operational risk is reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ORCC, the ERMC and the ROC. Operational risk is one of the most significant risks inherent in our strategy and business model. We face a wide variety of operational risks and consider operational risk across five categories: 

Information Security / Cyber Risk is the potential for misuse, disclosure, loss or corruption of our data (including customer data), or damage to information systems, that may adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of our information resources, including: 

•Internal Malicious - Deliberate acts of sabotage, theft, or other malicious activities committed by employees or other insiders 

•Internal Unintentional - Acts leading to misuse, disclosure, loss, or damage stemming from human error committed by employees and other insiders 

•External Malicious - The most exposed cyber risk; deliberate attacks from outside parties, including criminal syndicates, hacktivists, and nation states 

•External Unintentional - Similar to the internal unintentional, these acts cause misuse, disclosure, loss, or damage to the Company by outside parties but are not deliberate 

Information Technology Risk is associated with the use, ownership, operation, influence, and adoption of technology within the Company, including: 

•Disaster Recovery Risk - The risk of a natural or human-induced disaster (e.g., weather event, technology outage, unrest, pandemic) resulting in the inability to continue or recover critical technology systems in a timely manner 

•Change Management Risk - The risk that changes to technology systems do not meet the objectives and requirements of the business 

•IT Operations Risk - The risk of issues with network, database, application, or infrastructure systems that result in loss of revenue or productivity 

Vendor Risk is associated with our reliance on third parties to provide products or services either directly to us or on behalf of us to customers, employees, and/or institutions, including: 

•Failure of third party service providers to adequately perform certain functions or to perform oversight of their own third parties 

•Unexpected interruptions in service 

•Breach of data of the third party that includes our data 

Model Risk is associated with our models used for a variety of internal purposes that may be critical to our day-to-day business, operations, decisions, and/or protection from external factors, such as money 

E*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 66

Table of Contents 

laundering attempts. Some of the key risks associated with using models that may affect business decisions and client interactions include: 

•Model design, methodology, modeling choices, data, outputs are not appropriate for the model’s intended use 

•Model results cannot be interpreted, are not intuitive, or the model’s performance deteriorates, making the model unreliable for use 

General Operational Risk is meant to capture all other risks not detailed in the other specific operational risk categories above, including: 

•External or internal fraud 

•Process failures, unrelated to technology 

•Failure of internal controls, unrelated to technology 

•High turnover or loss of key personnel affecting performance 

Strategic Risk Management

Strategic risk is reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. We aim to mitigate strategic risk through the competitive positioning of our offerings. In our efforts to expand market share and product offerings, we may engage in inorganic growth opportunities that broaden our strategic risk profile. The main sources of strategic risk are: 

•A strategy which is ill-defined or which does not respond to trends in our competitive landscape 

•A lack of appropriate reaction mechanisms to adapt to changes in the business or regulatory environment 

•Regulatory changes impacting our strategic flexibility 

•Performance of our strategic initiatives or investments below key assumptions considered at the time of the investments 

Reputational Risk Management

Reputational risks are reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. Reputational risk can manifest itself in all areas of our business often due to negative publicity associated with other types of risk. The most significant reputational risks to us are in the following areas: 

•Business disruption, system failures, security breaches, identity theft, vendor, or other cyber related events

•Impact of investigations and lawsuits (with or without merit)

•Publication of regulatory findings

•Conflicts of interest

•Unethical behavior of any employee of the Company or members of the Boards of Directors

•Failure of controls supporting the accuracy of financial reports and disclosures

•Errors in public communication

E*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 67

Table of Contents 

Legal and Regulatory Risk Management

Legal and Regulatory risks are reviewed, challenged and monitored by the ERMC and the ROC. This risk exposes the Company to fines, civil money penalties, diminished reputation, reduced franchise value, limited business opportunities and reduced expansion potential. The following areas of legal and regulatory risk are particularly pertinent: 

•Extensive government regulation, including broker-dealer, banking and securities rules and regulations, which could restrict our business practices

•Changes in laws and regulation may have a material impact on our operations. In addition, we could face negative regulatory consequences, which could have a material negative effect on our business, if we are unable to meet these new requirements

•Failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, either domestically or internationally, could subject us to disciplinary actions, monetary or other penalties or restrictions that could significantly harm our business

•We may be subject to investigations, threatened or actual lawsuits as a result of alleged or actual business practices, changes in laws, business disputes, or regulatory expectations. If we fail to take appropriate measures to protect assets (for example, intellectual property) owned by the institution that could lead to a loss in franchise value.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its credit obligations. Our mortgage loan portfolio represents our most significant credit risk exposure.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

SUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented.

Critical Accounting Estimates

We believe that certain accounting estimates are critical because they require complex and subjective judgments by management. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations, and actual results could differ from our estimates. Our critical accounting estimates are described below.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is management's estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. Determining the adequacy of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We recognized a benefit to provision for loan losses of $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The benefit recognized reflected better than expected performance of our portfolio as well as recoveries in excess of prior expectations, including sales of charged-off loans and recoveries of previous charge-offs that were not included in our loss estimates. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7—Loans Receivable, Net for additional information on the allowance methodology and the quantitative and qualitative factors considered in determination of the allowance for loan losses for the periods presented. See New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted for additional information on the impact of the new accounting for credit losses guidance that became effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2020.

Valuation and Impairment of Goodwill and Acquired Intangible Assets

Goodwill is recognized as a result of business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis as of November 30 and in interim periods when events or changes indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a significant deterioration in the operating environment. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10—Goodwill and Other Intangibles, Net for additional information on the valuation and impairment policies governing goodwill and acquired intangible assets.

The valuation of goodwill and acquired intangible assets requires significant judgment and estimates by management. For example, the valuation of certain finite lived intangible assets acquired in the Gradifi, Capital One, and TCA transactions were performed using variations of the income approach (relief from royalty method or multi-period excess earnings method) which required management estimates of future earnings and cash flows. The useful life of the finite lived intangible assets was determined based on management's estimate of the period over which those intangible assets are expected to provide economic benefit to the Company. Management also applies judgment in conducting impairment testing for goodwill and finite lived intangible assets, including estimates of fair value based on the income or market approach and estimates required to determine the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets. The Company evaluated the customer relationship intangibles (CRI) associated with its retail channel for impairment as a result of the commissions reduction announced in the fourth quarter of 2019 and noted that no impairment or resulting change to the useful lives of the related CRIs was indicated as a result of this analysis.

E*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 69

Table of Contents 

If our estimates of fair value change due to future events differing significantly from the forecasts used to determine fair value, changes in our business or other factors, the Company may recognize an impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If the Company's publicly traded equity were to experience a significant decrease in market capitalization, goodwill would be tested for impairment. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, therefore changes in the estimated useful lives could result in the recognition of an impairment.

Income Taxes

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, we calculate income tax expense (benefit) based on our interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business. This requires us to estimate current tax obligations and the realizability of uncertain positions to assess temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities, which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities. We must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized and recognize valuation allowances based on our estimates of the amount that is not realizable. In estimating accrued taxes, we assess the relative metrics and risks of the appropriate tax treatment considering statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position. Because of the complexity of tax laws and regulations, interpretation can be difficult and subject to legal judgment given specific facts and circumstances.

Changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates, interpretations of tax laws, the status of examinations being conducted by various taxing authorities, and newly enacted statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance that impacts the relative merits and risks of the tax positions. These changes, when they occur, affect accrued taxes and can be significant to the Company's results of operations. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 14—Income Taxes for additional information about the Company's income taxes.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

Accounting for Credit Losses

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) amended the guidance on accounting for credit losses and has subsequently issued clarifications and improvements. The new guidance became effective for the Company's interim and annual periods beginning January 1, 2020. The amended guidance requires measurement of an allowance for credit losses for financial instruments, including loans and debt securities, and other commitments to extend credit held at the reporting date. For financial assets measured at amortized cost, factors such as historical performance, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including expected charge-off recoveries, will be used to estimate expected credit losses. The FASB issued additional amended guidance during the second quarter of 2019 clarifying that the current expected credit losses (CECL) standard allows for subsequent increases in the fair value of collateral for collateral-dependent loans to be recognized up to the amount previously charged-off.

Determining the CECL allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Company has not originated a mortgage loan since 2008 when the Company exited direct retail lending, which was the last remaining loan origination channel after the Company’s exit from the wholesale mortgage lending channel in 2007. We expect the legacy mortgage portfolio to continue its run-off for the foreseeable future. Our portfolio has seasoned, as the weighted average age of the mortgage loan portfolio is approximately 14 years, and substantially all interest-only loans have converted to amortizing loans. As of December 31, 2019, the Company expects to recognize an after-tax benefit related to mortgage loans of approximately $80 million as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at adoption on January 1, 2020. The expected benefit is related to the fair value of the underlying collateral for mortgage loans that were determined to be collateral-dependent and previously 

E*TRADE 2019 10-K | Page 70

Table of Contents 

written down to the fair value of the underlying collateral. The final opening adjustment will be included in the Company's periodic filing for the three months ended March 31, 2020.

The CECL allowance is based on assumptions about quantitative and qualitative factors, and changes to the allowance may result if future conditions differ from these assumptions. For example, in the event the cash received through liquidation or other form of recovery for collateral-dependent loans is less than the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell, additional losses may be recognized. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the CECL allowance in future periods. Our underlying assumptions and judgments could prove to be inaccurate, which could impact our regulatory capital position and results of operations in future periods. See Note 1—Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.

Interest Rates and Interest Differential

Increases and decreases in interest income and interest expense result from changes in average balances (volume) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as changes in average interest rates (rate). The following table shows the effect that these factors had on the interest earned on our interest-earning assets and the interest incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of rate changes is calculated by multiplying the change in average yield/cost by the current year’s average daily balance, with the remaining change applied to volume (dollars in millions):

Borrowings

Deposits represent our most significant and stable source of funding. In addition, we have utilized wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances and repurchase agreements.

We are a member of, and own capital stock in, the FHLB system. The FHLB provides us with reserve credit capacity and authorizes us to apply for advances based on the security of pledged mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities—principally agency-backed securities—provided we meet certain creditworthiness standards. 

We are also able to raise funds by entering into agreements to repurchase the same or similar securities. The counterparties to these agreements hold the securities in custody. We account for repurchase agreements as borrowings and secure them with designated fixed- and variable-rate debt securities. We may use the proceeds from these transactions to meet our cash flow or asset/liability matching needs.
