ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

On April 1, 2019, DowDuPont Inc. (“DowDuPont” and effective June 3, 2019, n/k/a DuPont de Nemours, Inc. or "DuPont") completed the separation of its materials science business and Dow Inc. became the direct parent company of The Dow Chemical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“TDCC” and together with Dow Inc., “Dow” or the “Company”), owning all of the outstanding common shares of TDCC. For filings related to the period commencing April 1, 2019 and thereafter, TDCC was deemed the predecessor to Dow Inc., and the historical results of TDCC are deemed the historical results of Dow Inc. for periods prior to and including March 31, 2019. As a result of the parent/subsidiary relationship between Dow Inc. and TDCC, and the expectation that the financial statements and disclosures of each company will be substantially similar, the companies are filing a combined report for this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information reflected in the report is equally applicable to both Dow Inc. and TDCC, except where otherwise noted.

The separation was contemplated by the merger of equals transaction effective August 31, 2017, under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017. TDCC and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Historical DuPont”) each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont and, as a result, TDCC and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the “Merger”). Subsequent to the Merger, TDCC and Historical DuPont engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. Dow Inc. was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont to serve as the holding company for the materials science business. 

As of the effective date and time of the distribution, DowDuPont does not beneficially own any equity interest in Dow and no longer consolidates Dow and its consolidated subsidiaries into its financial results. The consolidated financial results of Dow for all periods presented reflect the distribution of TDCC’s agricultural sciences business (“AgCo”) and specialty products business (“SpecCo”) as discontinued operations, as well as reflect the receipt of Historical DuPont’s ethylene and ethylene copolymers businesses (other than its ethylene acrylic elastomers business) (“ECP”) as a common control transaction from the closing of the Merger on August 31, 2017. See Notes 3 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Dow Inc.'s Amendment No. 4 to the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 8, 2019 for additional information.

Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity are presented on a continuing operations basis.

Except as otherwise indicated by the context, the terms "Union Carbide" means Union Carbide Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and "Dow Silicones" means Dow Silicones Corporation (formerly known as Dow Corning Corporation, which changed its name effective as of February 1, 2018), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Items Affecting Comparability of Financial Results 

As a result of the separation from DowDuPont, pro forma net sales and pro forma Operating EBIT are provided in this section and based on the consolidated financial statements of TDCC, adjusted to give effect to the separation from DowDuPont as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2017. Pro forma adjustments include (1) the margin impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva, Inc. ("Corteva") in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont (only included for 2018 and the first three months of 2019), (2) the inclusion of ECP for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, (3) the removal of the amortization of ECP's inventory step-up recognized in connection with the Merger, (4) the elimination of the impact of events directly attributable to the Merger, internal reorganization and business realignment, separation, distribution and other related transactions (e.g., one-time transaction costs), and (5) the elimination of the effect of a consummated divestiture agreed to with certain regulatory agencies as a condition of approval for the Merger. These adjustments impacted the consolidated results as well as the reportable segments. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the pro forma adjustments impacting segment measures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The Company has policies and procedures in place designed to ensure that it and its consolidated subsidiaries remain in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. 

OVERVIEW

The following is a summary of the results from continuing operations and other notable events for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2019:

The Company reported net sales in 2019 of $43 billion, down 13 percent from $49.6 billion in 2018, with declines across all geographic regions and operating segments. These declines were due to a decrease in local price of 11 percent, a volume decline of 2 percent and a 1 percent unfavorable currency impact, partially offset by a 1 percent increase in Portfolio & Other.

Local price decreased 11 percent compared with the same period last year, with decreases in all operating segments, including double-digit declines in Packaging & Specialty Plastics and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure (both down 12 percent). Local price decreased in all geographic regions, including double-digit declines in Latin America (down 14 percent), Asia Pacific (down 12 percent) and U.S. & Canada (down 11 percent).

Volume decreased 2 percent compared with 2018, driven primarily by lower hydrocarbon co-product sales. Packaging & Specialty Plastics and Performance Materials & Coatings reported volume declines (both down 3 percent) while Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure was flat. Volume decreased in EMEAI (down 4 percent) and Latin America and U.S. & Canada (both down 3 percent), partially offset by an increase in Asia Pacific (up 5 percent). 

Currency had an unfavorable impact of 1 percent on net sales, driven primarily by EMEAI (down 3 percent).

Research and development ("R&D") expenses were $765 million in 2019, down from $800 million in 2018. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses for Dow Inc. and TDCC were $1,590 million and $1,585 million, respectively, in 2019, down from $1,782 million in 2018. R&D and SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to cost reductions, cost synergies, stranded cost removal and lower performance-based compensation costs.

26
Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net were $3,219 million in 2019, primarily reflecting post-merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program, a goodwill impairment charge of $1,039 million related to the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit and $1,755 million of pretax charges related to Sadara Chemical Company ("Sadara").

Integration and separation costs for Dow Inc. and TDCC were $1,063 million and $1,039 million, respectively, in 2019, down from $1,179 million in 2018, reflecting the wind-down of post-Merger integration and business separation activities.

Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates was a loss of $94 million in 2019, down from earnings of $555 million in 2018, primarily due to increased equity losses from Sadara and lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures and the Thai joint ventures.

Sundry income (expense) - net for Dow Inc. and TDCC was income of $461 million and income of $573 million, respectively, in 2019, compared with income of $96 million in 2018. Sundry income (expense) - net increased primarily due to an increase in foreign currency exchange gains as well as a net gain related to litigation matters. 

Net income (loss) available for Dow Inc. and TDCC common stockholder(s) was a loss of $1,359 million and $1,237 million, respectively, in 2019, compared with income of $4,641 million in 2018. Earnings (loss) per share for Dow Inc. was a loss of $1.84 per share in 2019, compared with income of $6.21 per share in 2018.

30
Cost of Sales

Cost of sales ("COS") was $36.7 billion in 2019, down $4.4 billion from $41.1 billion in 2018. COS decreased in 2019 primarily due to lower feedstock and other raw material costs, decreased sales volume, cost synergies, stranded cost removal and a favorable adjustment to the warranty accrual of an exited business, which were partially offset by $75 million of transaction-related costs resulting from the separation from DowDuPont (related to the Corporate segment) and $399 million of environmental charges related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($5 million), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($8 million), Performance Materials & Coatings ($50 million) and Corporate ($336 million). COS as a percentage of sales was 85.3 percent in 2019 compared with 82.8 percent in 2018.

COS was $41.1 billion in 2018, up $4.7 billion from $36.4 billion in 2017, primarily due to increased sales volume, which reflected additional capacity from U.S. Gulf Coast growth projects and increased supply from Sadara, higher feedstock and other raw material costs and increased planned maintenance turnaround costs which more than offset lower commissioning expenses related to U.S. Gulf Coast growth projects and cost synergies. COS as a percentage of sales was 82.8 percent in 2018 compared with 83.1 percent in 2017. 

Personnel Count

The Company permanently employed approximately 36,500 people at December 31, 2019, down from approximately 37,600 people at December 31, 2018 and 39,200 people at December 31, 2017 primarily due to the Company's restructuring programs.

Research and Development Expenses

R&D expenses were $765 million in 2019, compared with $800 million in 2018 and $803 million in 2017. R&D expenses in 2019 decreased compared with 2018 primarily due to cost reductions and lower performance-based compensation costs. R&D expenses in 2018 were essentially flat compared with 2017.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses for Dow Inc. and TDCC were $1,590 million and $1,585 million, respectively, in 2019, compared with $1,782 million in 2018 and $1,795 million in 2017. In 2019, SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to cost reductions, cost synergies, stranded cost removal and lower performance-based compensation costs. SG&A expenses were favorably impacted by a recovery of a portion of legal costs related to the Nova litigation award in the third quarter of 2019. In 2018, SG&A expenses decreased primarily due to additional cost reductions and lower performance-based compensation costs which more than offset a full year of expense from the ECP business and the absence of the recovery of costs related to the Nova patent infringement award in 2017. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Nova litigation awards.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles was $419 million in 2019, down from $469 million in 2018, primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized. Amortization of intangibles in 2018 increased from $400 million in 2017, primarily due to the receipt of ECP. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on intangible assets.

Restructuring, Goodwill Impairment and Asset Related Charges - Net 

Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net were $3,219 million in 2019, $221 million in 2018 and $2,739 million in 2017.

DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program

In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company concluded that its equity method investment in Sadara was other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company also reserved certain accounts and notes receivable and accrued interest balances due to uncertainty on the timing of collection. As a result, the Company recorded a $1,755 million pretax charge related to Sadara. The charge by segment was as follows: $370 million in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $1,168 million in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and $217 million in Corporate. 

2018 Charges

In 2018, the Company recognized an additional pretax impairment charge of $34 million related primarily to capital additions at its Santa Vitoria manufacturing facility. The impairment charge was related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics.

2017 Charges

In 2017, the Company recognized a $622 million pretax impairment charge related to its Santa Vitoria manufacturing facility. The Company determined it would not pursue an expansion of the facility’s ethanol mill into downstream derivative products, primarily as a result of cheaper ethane-based production as well as the Company’s new assets coming online on the U.S. Gulf Coast which can be used to meet growing market demands in Brazil. As a result of this decision, cash flow analysis indicated the carrying amount of the impacted assets was not recoverable. The impairment charge was related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics.

The Company also recognized other pretax impairment charges of $246 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, including charges related to manufacturing assets of $159 million, an equity method investment of $81 million and other assets of $6 million.

In 2018 and 2019, integration and separation costs were higher as a result of post-merger integration and business separation activities.

Equity in Earnings of Nonconsolidated Affiliates

The Company’s share of the earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates in 2019 was a loss of $94 million, compared with earnings of $555 million in 2018 and $394 million in 2017. In 2019, equity earnings decreased primarily due to lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures (due to lower monethylene glycol and polyethylene prices) and the Thai joint ventures and increased equity losses from Sadara. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s evaluation of its equity method investment in Sadara for other-than-temporary impairment.

In 2018, equity earnings increased from 2017 as higher earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures and lower equity losses from Sadara were partially offset by lower equity earnings from the Thai joint ventures. 

Sundry Income (Expense) - Net

Sundry income (expense) – net includes a variety of income and expense items such as foreign currency exchange gains and losses, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments and assets, non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit plan credits or costs, and certain litigation matters.

These gains were more than offset by $676 million of non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs, primarily driven by a $687 million settlement charge for a U.S. non-qualified pension plan (related to Corporate), and foreign currency exchange losses. See Notes 6, 8, 17 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Dow Inc.

Sundry income (expense) - net for 2019 was income of $461 million, compared with income of $96 million in 2018 and an expense of $154 million in 2017. In addition to the amounts previously discussed above for TDCC, sundry income (expense) - net in 2019 included a $51 million loss on post-closing adjustments related to a previous divestiture and $69 million in charges associated with agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution, which provides for cross-indemnities and allocations of obligations and liabilities for periods prior to, at and after completion of the separation (both related to Corporate). See Notes 4, 8, 17, 21 and 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Interest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount

Dow Inc.

Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $933 million in 2019, down from $1,063 million in 2018, primarily due to debt reductions and lower interest bearing notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2018, which replaced higher interest bearing notes redeemed in the fourth quarter of 2018. Interest expense and amortization of debt discount in 2018 was up from $914 million in 2017, primarily reflecting the effect of lower capitalized interest as a result of decreased capital spending. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 12 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt financing activity.

TDCC

Interest expense and amortization of debt discount was $952 million in 2019, down from $1,063 million in 2018. Interest expense and amortization of debt discount in 2018 was up from $914 million in 2017. In addition to the amounts previously discussed above for Dow Inc., TDCC had interest expense related to an intercompany loan with Dow Inc. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Provision for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations

The Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the level of equity earnings, since most earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. The underlying factors affecting the Company's overall tax rate are summarized in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“The Act”) was enacted. The Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred, created new provisions related to foreign sourced earnings, eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction and moved to a hybrid territorial system. At December 31, 2017, the Company had not completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act; however, the Company made a reasonable estimate of the effects on its existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118, income tax effects of The Act were refined upon obtaining, preparing, and analyzing additional information during the measurement period. At December 31, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of The Act.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded the impacts of tax law changes enacted in Switzerland. As a result, deferred tax assets increased by $92 million.

The provision for income taxes on continuing operations was $470 million in 2019, compared with $809 million in 2018 and $1,524 million in 2017. The tax rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by non-deductible goodwill and investment impairments, geographic mix of earnings and reduced equity earnings. These factors resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 37.7 percent for Dow Inc. in 2019.

The tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the reduced U.S. federal corporate income tax rate as a result of The Act and benefits related to the issuance of stock-based compensation and unfavorably impacted by non-deductible restructuring costs and increases in statutory income in Latin America and Canada due to local currency devaluations. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.6 percent in 2018.

The tax rate for 2017 was unfavorably impacted by the enactment of The Act, the impairment of goodwill for which there was no corresponding tax deduction, charges related to tax attributes in the United States and Germany as a result of the Merger and certain non-deductible costs associated with the Merger. The tax rate was favorably impacted by the geographic mix of earnings, equity earnings and the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting," which resulted in the recognition of excess tax benefits related to the issuance of stock-based compensation in the provision for income taxes on continuing operations. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 643.0 percent for 2017.

Income from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax

Income from discontinued operations, net of tax was $445 million in 2019, $1,835 million in 2018 and $1,882 million in 2017, and was related to the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo to DowDuPont as a result of the separation. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

34
Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 

Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $87 million in 2019, $134 million in 2018 and $130 million in 2017. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to the Company's acquisition of full ownership in a propylene oxide manufacturing joint venture on October 1, 2019. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to the sale of the Company's ownership interests in the SKC Haas Display Films group of companies on June 30, 2017. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from discontinued operations of $13 million in 2019, $32 million in 2018 and $28 million in 2017 are included in the amounts above. See Notes 20 and 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

Net Income (Loss) Available for the Common Stockholder(s)

Net income (loss) available for Dow Inc. and TDCC common stockholder(s) was a loss of $1,359 million and $1,237 million, respectively, in 2019, compared with income of $4,641 million in 2018 and income of $465 million in 2017. Earnings (loss) per share of Dow Inc. was a loss of $1.84 per share in 2019, compared with income of $6.21 per share in 2018 and income of $0.60 per share in 2017. Following the separation from DowDuPont, TDCC's common shares are owned solely by Dow Inc.

SEGMENT RESULTS

Effective with the Merger, TDCC's business activities were components of DowDuPont's business operations and were reported as a single operating segment. Following the separation from DowDuPont, the Company changed the manner in which its business activities were managed. The Company's portfolio now includes six global businesses which are organized into the following operating segments: Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the operating segments and the Company's totals. The Company did not aggregate any operating segments when determining its reportable segments. 

Following the separation from DowDuPont, the Company changed its practice of transferring ethylene to its downstream derivative businesses at cost to transferring ethylene at market prices. The Company also changed certain of its Corporate segment allocation practices, including costs previously assigned to AgCo and SpecCo ("stranded costs") which are now allocated to the operating segments. These changes to the Company's segment results have been consistently applied to all periods presented.

Dow reported geographic information for the following regions: U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and EMEAI. As a result of the separation from DowDuPont, the Company changed the geographic alignment for the country of India to be reflected in EMEAI (previously reported in Asia Pacific).

The Company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is pro forma Operating EBIT as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines pro forma Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., "Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes") before interest, plus pro forma adjustments, excluding the impact of significant items. Pro forma Operating EBIT by segment includes all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to Dow as a whole are assigned to Corporate. The Company also presents pro forma net sales as it is included in management’s measure of segment performance and is regularly reviewed by the CODM. Pro forma net sales includes the impact of ECP from January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, as well as the impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of these measures and a summary of the pro forma adjustments impacting segment measures, which are consistent with the pro forma adjustments included in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 3, 2019, with the SEC. 

PACKAGING & SPECIALTY PLASTICS

Packaging & Specialty Plastics consists of two highly integrated global businesses: Hydrocarbons & Energy and Packaging and Specialty Plastics. The segment employs the industry’s broadest polyolefin product portfolio, supported by the Company’s proprietary catalyst and manufacturing process technologies, to work at the customer’s design table throughout the value chain to deliver more reliable and durable, higher performing, and more sustainable plastics to customers in food and specialty packaging; industrial and consumer packaging; health and hygiene; caps, closures and pipe applications; consumer durables; automotive; and infrastructure. Ethylene is transferred to downstream derivative businesses at market-based prices, which are generally equivalent to prevailing market prices for large volume purchases.This segment also includes the results of The Kuwait Styrene Company K.S.C.C. and The SCG-Dow Group, as well as a portion of the results of EQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C.C. ("EQUATE"), The Kuwait Olefins Company K.S.C.C. ("TKOC"), Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company.

The Company is responsible for marketing a majority of Sadara products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company's established sales channels. As part of this arrangement, the Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Versus 2018

Packaging & Specialty Plastics net sales were $20,245 million in 2019, down 16 percent from net sales of $24,195 million in 2018. Pro forma net sales were $20,245 million in 2019, a decrease of 16 percent compared with pro forma net sales of $24,237 million in 2018, with local price down 12 percent, volume down 3 percent, and an unfavorable currency impact of 1 percent, primarily in EMEAI. Local price decreased in both businesses and across all geographic regions driven by reduced polyethylene prices and lower prices for Hydrocarbons & Energy co-products. Volume declined for the segment in all geographic regions, except Asia Pacific. Hydrocarbons & Energy volume declines more than offset volume gains in Packaging and Specialty Plastics. Volume decreased in Hydrocarbons & Energy primarily due to planned maintenance turnaround activity in Europe, increased internal consumption of ethylene on the U.S. Gulf Coast and lighter feedslate usage in Europe, leading to lower co-product production. Volume increased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics in Asia Pacific and EMEAI. Packaging and Specialty Plastics volume growth was driven by strong end-market growth in flexible food and specialty packaging, industrial and consumer packaging, and health and hygiene applications.

Pro forma Operating EBIT was $2,904 million in 2019, down 19 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $3,593 million in 2018. Pro forma Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, reduced equity earnings at the Kuwait joint ventures due to lower polyethylene margins, lower sales volume in the Hydrocarbons & Energy business and the impact of an outage in Argentina, which more than offset lower feedstock and other raw material costs, volume gains in the Packaging and Specialty Plastics business and cost synergies.

2018 Versus 2017

Packaging & Specialty Plastics net sales were $24,195 million in 2018, up 13 percent from $21,504 million in 2017. Pro forma net sales were $24,237 million in 2018, up from pro forma net sales of $22,546 million in 2017. Pro forma net sales increased 7 percent compared with 2017, with volume up 5 percent, a currency benefit of 1 percent, primarily in EMEAI, and local price up 1 percent. Volume increased in both businesses and across all geographic regions primarily due to new capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast and increased supply from Sadara. Packaging and Specialty Plastics' volume growth was driven by increased demand in industrial and consumer packaging, food and specialty packaging, health and hygiene solutions and elastomer applications. Hydrocarbons & Energy volume increased primarily due to higher sales of ethylene and ethylene co-products. Local price increased in all geographic regions, except U.S. & Canada. Hydrocarbons & Energy local price increased as a result of higher Brent crude oil prices, which increased approximately 30 percent compared with 2017. Packaging and Specialty Plastics local price was flat when compared with 2017 as local price increases in Latin America were offset by declines in EMEAI. 

36
Pro forma Operating EBIT was $3,593 million in 2018, down 3 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $3,712 million in 2017. Pro forma Operating EBIT decreased as the impact of higher feedstock and other raw materials costs, increased costs from planned maintenance turnarounds and the unfavorable impact of stranded costs more than offset higher sales volume, reflecting additional capacity from growth projects, higher selling prices, the benefit from currency on sales, cost synergies, higher equity earnings and lower startup and commissioning costs.

INDUSTRIAL INTERMEDIATES & INFRASTRUCTURE

Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure consists of two customer-centric global businesses - Industrial Solutions and Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals - that develop important intermediate chemicals that are essential to manufacturing processes, as well as downstream, customized materials and formulations that use advanced development technologies. These businesses primarily produce and market ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives that are aligned to market segments as diverse as appliances, coatings, infrastructure and oil and gas. The global scale and reach of these businesses, world-class technology and R&D capabilities and materials science expertise enable the Company to be a premier solutions provider offering customers value-add sustainable solutions to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, product effectiveness and durability across a wide range of home comfort and appliances, building and construction, adhesives and lubricant applications, among others. This segment also includes a portion of the results of EQUATE, TKOC, Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company.

The Company is responsible for marketing a majority of Sadara products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company's established sales channels. As part of this arrangement, the Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Versus 2018

Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure net sales were $13,440 million in 2019, down 13 percent from $15,447 million in 2018. Pro forma net sales were $13,449 million in 2019, down from pro forma net sales of $15,465 million in 2018. Pro forma net sales decreased 13 percent in 2019, with local price down 12 percent and an unfavorable currency impact of 2 percent, primarily in EMEAI, which were partially offset by a 1 percent increase in volume. Price decreased in both businesses and all geographic regions, driven by lower feedstock and other raw material costs and unfavorable supply/demand fundamentals. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals reported volume increases in all geographic regions, primarily reflecting increased supply from Sadara and growth in polyurethanes systems applications, which were partially offset by a decline of caustic soda volume due to planned maintenance turnaround activities. Industrial Solutions volume decreased in EMEAI and U.S & Canada and was flat in Latin America and Asia Pacific, primarily driven by reduced availability of glycol ethers, performance solvents and monoethylene glycol due to planned and unplanned events that more than offset higher demand for industrial specialties. 

37
Pro forma Operating EBIT was $845 million in 2019, down 52 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $1,767 million in 2018. Pro forma Operating EBIT decreased as a result of margin compression across both businesses as well as lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures and increased equity losses from Sadara, which more than offset cost reductions.

2018 Versus 2017

Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure net sales were $15,447 million in 2018, up 19 percent from $12,951 million in 2017. Pro forma net sales were $15,465 million in 2018, up from pro forma net sales of $12,951 million in 2017. Pro forma net sales increased 19 percent in 2018, with volume up 13 percent, local price up 5 percent and a currency benefit of 1 percent, primarily in EMEAI. Volume increased in both businesses and across all geographic regions. Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals reported volume increases in all geographic regions, except Latin America, primarily reflecting increased supply from Sadara. Industrial Solutions volume increased in all geographic regions reflecting greater production from Sadara and increased demand in industrial specialties. Local price increased in both businesses and all geographic regions, except Asia Pacific. Local price increases were driven by higher feedstock and other raw material costs, pricing initiatives and strong demand for caustic soda, propylene glycols and propylene oxide which more than offset price declines in isocyanates. 

Pro forma Operating EBIT was $1,767 million in 2018, up 20 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $1,470 million in 2017. Pro forma Operating EBIT increased as the impact of higher selling prices, cost synergies, higher equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures and lower equity losses from Sadara more than offset contraction in isocyanates margins, the unfavorable impact of stranded costs and higher feedstock and other raw material costs. 

PERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COATINGS

Performance Materials & Coatings includes industry-leading franchises that deliver a wide array of solutions into consumer and infrastructure end-markets. The segment consists of two global businesses: Coatings & Performance Monomers and Consumer Solutions. These businesses primarily utilize the Company's acrylics-, cellulosics- and silicone-based technology platforms to serve the needs of the architectural and industrial coatings, home care and personal care end-markets. Both businesses employ materials science capabilities, global reach and unique products and technology to combine chemistry platforms to deliver differentiated offerings to customers. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Versus 2018

Performance Materials & Coatings net sales were $8,923 million in 2019, down 8 percent from net sales of $9,677 million in 2018. Pro forma net sales were $8,961 million in 2019, down 9 percent from pro forma net sales of $9,865 million in 2018 with local price down 6 percent, an unfavorable currency impact of 2 percent and volume down 1 percent. Local price decreased in both businesses and all geographic regions. Local price decreased in Consumer Solutions due to lower siloxanes prices, primarily 

38
in Asia Pacific and EMEAI. Coatings & Performance Monomers local price declined in all geographic regions in response to lower feedstock and other raw material costs. Volume for the segment declined in all geographic regions except Asia Pacific. Consumer Solutions volume was flat, with volume growth in Asia Pacific, offset by volume declines in Latin America and EMEAI. Consumer Solutions volume was flat in U.S. & Canada. Coatings & Performance Monomers volume declined in all geographic regions. The decline in volume was driven by increased captive use of coatings products which drove soft demand in coating applications, primarily architectural binders, and lower demand for acrylates and methacrylates due to supply/demand balances. 

Pro forma Operating EBIT was $918 million in 2019, down 26 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $1,246 million in 2018. Pro forma Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to margin compression in both businesses, which more than offset lower planned maintenance turnaround spending and cost synergies. 

2018 Versus 2017

Performance Materials & Coatings net sales were $9,677 million in 2018, up from $8,892 million in 2017. Pro forma net sales were $9,865 million in 2018, up from pro forma net sales of $8,892 million in 2017. Pro forma net sales increased 11 percent in 2018, with an increase in local price of 10 percent, a benefit of 2 percent from portfolio actions, a benefit from currency of 1 percent, primarily in EMEAI, and a decrease in volume of 2 percent. Local price increased in both businesses and all geographic regions. Consumer Solutions local price increased primarily due to disciplined price/volume management in upstream silicone intermediates, which more than offset a decrease in volume. Local price increased in Coatings & Performance Monomers in response to higher feedstock and other raw material costs and favorable supply/demand fundamentals. Volume decreased in both businesses and all geographic regions, except Asia Pacific. Volume decreased in Consumer Solutions primarily as a result of targeted reductions of low-margin business, primarily in the home care market sector. Volume decreased slightly for Coatings & Performance Monomers, with a decline in all geographic regions, except Asia Pacific.

Pro forma Operating EBIT was $1,246 million in 2018, up 53 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $817 million in 2017. Pro forma Operating EBIT improved compared with 2017 as higher selling prices and the favorable impact of cost synergies more than offset the unfavorable impact of stranded costs and higher feedstock and other raw material costs. 

CORPORATE

Corporate includes certain enterprise and governance activities (including insurance operations, environmental operations, etc.); non-business aligned joint ventures; non-business aligned litigation expenses; and discontinued or non-aligned businesses.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2019 Versus 2018

Net sales and pro forma net sales for Corporate, which primarily relate to the Company's insurance operations, were $343 million in 2019, up from net sales and pro forma net sales of $285 million in 2018. 

Pro forma Operating EBIT was a loss of $315 million in 2019, compared with a pro forma Operating EBIT loss of $370 million in 2018. Compared with 2018, pro forma Operating EBIT improved primarily due to cost reductions and stranded cost removal. 

2018 Versus 2017

Net sales and pro forma net sales for Corporate were $285 million in 2018, compared with net sales and pro forma net sales of $383 million in 2017. 

Pro forma Operating EBIT was a loss of $370 million in 2018, compared with a loss of $422 million in 2017. Compared with 2017, pro forma Operating EBIT improved primarily due to lower discontinued business costs and cost reductions. 

OUTLOOK

Operating Segments & End-Market Expectations

In 2020, the Company expects crude oil, natural gas and feedstock costs to remain volatile and sensitive to external macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. The Company currently expects crude oil prices to be, on average, flat to slightly higher than 2019. Crude oil fundamentals suggest ample global supply to meet current demand; however, geopolitical tensions could add a risk premium that potentially supports higher prices.

39
The Company expects natural gas prices to be, on average, lower than 2019. In U.S. & Canada, robust supplies of natural gas are expected to keep domestic prices globally competitive. U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas ("LNG") are expected to increase further in 2020. In Europe, the supply of natural gas is expected to continue to be plentiful, both from pipeline supply and from growing LNG imports.

In Packaging & Specialty Plastics, integrated margins are expected to remain stable in U.S. & Canada, supported by delays in new capacity additions, solid underlying demand and regional feedstock cost advantages. Margins in Europe are expected to remain challenged as a result of weaker regional demand and flat to higher feedstock costs. Margins in Asia Pacific commenced 2020 slightly below break-even levels, while full year margins are expected to be comparable to the second half of 2019. Profitability could vary materially depending on global GDP growth, industry operating rates, timing of capacity startups and fluctuations in global crude oil, natural gas and feedstock prices. The Hydrocarbons & Energy business expects to bring online approximately 500,000 metric tons of additional ethylene capacity in Texas as part of its suite of incremental growth investments. The new capacity is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2020.

In Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, monoethylene glycol ("MEG") margins are expected to remain constrained in 2020 due to new industry capacity additions. End-market conditions for polyurethane intermediates are expected to remain highly competitive, with demand softness expected in key applications related to infrastructure, household appliances, automotive and furniture and bedding. Methyl diphenyl diisocyanate ("MDI") prices are expected to remain at low levels due to additional industry capacity and weak end-market fundamentals.

In Performance Materials & Coatings, prices for commodity siloxane products are expected to be similar to those observed in the second half of 2019. Downstream silicones volume is expected to grow in excess of GDP, particularly for applications related to home and personal care, high performance building and construction and pressure-sensitive adhesives. The Company will continue to pursue incremental downstream silicones capacity debottleneck projects to meet demand in consumer driven end-markets. Global architectural coatings demand is expected to remain soft in the do-it-yourself and retail market segments. Industrial coatings are also projected to soften in 2020; however, the Company’s focus will be on capturing opportunities from customers’ shift to waterborne chemistries where Dow has unique technologies and solutions.

Other factors impacting operating segment profitability include:

•Planned maintenance turnaround spending is expected to be approximately flat compared with 2019.

•Equity losses in nonconsolidated affiliates are expected to be slightly unfavorable compared with 2019. With respect to Sadara, which impacts the Packaging & Specialty Plastics and Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating segments, the Company expects to continue to record equity losses due to anticipated funding commitments with the joint venture.

Other Income Statement Expectations

Additional items that may impact the consolidated statements of income in 2020 include:

•The service cost component of pension expense is expected to be flat compared with 2019. The non-operating pension benefit is expected to be a headwind of approximately $125 million compared with 2019.

•Interest expense and amortization of debt discount is expected to be approximately $850 million in 2020, reflecting lower gross debt compared with 2019.

Projected Uses of Cash

Items that may impact the consolidated statements of cash flows in 2020 include:

•Integration and separation spending is expected to be approximately $200 million to $250 million. Year over year reductions in integration and separation spending as well as cash payments related to the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program will result in reduced cash spending of approximately $1 billion compared with 2019.

•Cash contributions to global pension plans are expected to be limited to mandatory minimum contributions. The total cash outflow is projected to be approximately $250 million.

•Capital expenditures are expected to be $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion. The Company will adjust its spending within this range through the year as economic conditions develop.

•The Company expects to loan approximately $500 million to Sadara and all or a portion of the loan could potentially be converted into equity.

•The Company expects to preferentially deploy its free cash flow1 in a balanced way between shareholder returns and debt reduction.

1. Dow defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-15, less capital expenditures.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,367 million at December 31, 2019 and $2,724 million at December 31, 2018, of which $986 million at December 31, 2019 and $2,013 million at December 31, 2018, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents held by subsidiaries in foreign countries is due to repatriation activities. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. 

The cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Dow has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the U.S., which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. At December 31, 2019, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. The Company has and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations; however, these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the Company.

The Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1.Updated for ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" ("ASU 2016-15") (including related SEC interpretive guidance) and ASU 2016-18, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash," which the Company adopted in 2018.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities

Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in 2019 compared with 2018. The increase was primarily due to improvements in working capital, a cash receipt related to the Nova ethylene asset matter, advance payments from customers for product supply agreements, lower pension contributions and higher dividends received from nonconsolidated affiliates, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash earnings. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2018 improved from cash used for operating activities from continuing operations in 2017, primarily due to the change in the Company's accounts receivable securitization facilities discussed in the section titled "Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures" and a decrease in cash used for working capital requirements, which were partially offset by the absence of certain cash receipts in 2017.

41
[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1.Amounts exclude assets and liabilities of discontinued operations.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1.The increase in days sales outstanding in receivables was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable as a result of the Company’s accounts receivable securitization facilities moving from off-balance sheet arrangements to secured borrowing arrangements in the second half of 2018. 

2.The increase in days sales in inventory is primarily due to a decrease in COS, driven by lower sales and raw material costs, in addition to an increase in average ending inventory. 

3.The increase in days payables outstanding is primarily due to a decrease in average accounts payable and a decrease in COS, which were partially offset by an increase in average ending inventory.

Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations decreased in 2019 compared with 2018. The reduction was primarily due to the separation of AgCo and SpecCo on April 1, 2019. The Company had cash payments and receipts with DuPont and Corteva that related to certain agreements and matters related to the separation from DowDuPont. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Cash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations decreased in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to changes in working capital requirements.

Cash Flows from Investing Activities

Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2019 was primarily for capital expenditures, purchases of investments and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2018 was primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits. Cash provided by investing activities from continuing operations in 2017 was primarily from proceeds from interests in trade accounts receivable conduits, proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and proceeds from divestitures, including the divestiture of the EAA Business, which were partially offset by capital expenditures, purchases of investments and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, primarily with Sadara. 

The Company loaned Sadara $473 million in 2019 (zero in 2018 and $735 million in 2017) and a portion of these loans has been converted to equity. In the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company reserved certain notes receivable and accrued interest balances with Sadara due to uncertainty around timing of collection. The Company expects to loan Sadara approximately $500 million in 2020 and all or a portion of the loan could potentially be converted into equity. Additionally, the Company anticipates providing future financial support to Sadara through loans or capital contributions which will be subject to collectability assessments. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The Company's capital expenditures related to continuing operations, including capital expenditures of consolidated variable interest entities, were $1,961 million in 2019, $2,091 million in 2018 and $2,807 million in 2017. The Company expects capital spending in 2020 to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.75 billion. The Company will adjust its spending within this range through the year as economic conditions develop.

Capital spending in 2019, 2018 and 2017 included spending related to certain U.S. Gulf Coast investment projects including: a world-scale ethylene production facility and an ELITE™ Enhanced Polyethylene production facility, both of which commenced operations in 2017; a NORDEL™ Metallocene EPDM production facility, a Low Density Polyethylene ("LDPE") production facility, a High Melt Index ("HMI") AFFINITY™ polymer production facility and debottlenecking of an existing bi-modal gas phase polyethylene production facility, all of which commenced operations in 2018; and an expansion of the Company's new ethylene production facility expected to commence operations in 2020, bringing the facility's total ethylene capacity to 2,000 kilotonnes per annum and making it the largest ethylene cracker in the world. 

42
Cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations in 2019 was primarily for capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of property, businesses and ownership interests in nonconsolidated affiliates. Cash used for investing activities from discontinued operations in 2018 was primarily for capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of property and businesses. Cash provided by investing activities from discontinued operations in 2017 was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of property and businesses, which was partially offset by capital expenditures.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities

Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in 2019 included payments on long-term debt and dividends paid to DowDuPont, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. In addition, Dow Inc. received cash as part of the separation from DowDuPont, which was more than offset by dividends paid to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock. Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in 2018 included dividends paid to DowDuPont and payments of long-term debt, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. Cash used for financing activities in continuing operations in 2017 included dividends paid to stockholders through the close of the Merger, a dividend paid to DowDuPont in the fourth quarter of 2017, and payments of long-term debt. See Notes 16 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the issuance and retirement of debt and the Company's share repurchases and dividends.

Cash used for financing activities from discontinued operations in 2019, 2018 and 2017 primarily related to distributions to noncontrolling interests and employee taxes paid for share-based payment arrangements.

Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures

Cash Flows from Operating Activities - Continuing Operations - Excluding Impact of ASU 2016-15 

Cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-15, is defined as cash provided by (used for) operating activities - continuing operations, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-15 and related interpretive guidance. Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure is relevant and meaningful as it presents cash flows from operating activities inclusive of all trade accounts receivable collection activity, which Dow utilizes in support of its operating activities.

Free Cash Flow 

Dow defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-15, less capital expenditures. Under this definition, free cash flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free cash flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represent the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to shareholders. Free cash flow is an integral financial measure used in Dow's financial planning process.

Pro Forma Operating EBITDA 

Dow defines pro forma operating EBITDA as pro forma earnings (i.e. "Pro forma income from continuing operations before income taxes") before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items.

Cash Flow Conversion (Pro Forma Operating EBITDA to Cash Flow From Operations)

Dow defines cash flow conversion (or pro forma Operating EBITDA to cash flow from operations) as cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations, excluding the impact of ASU 2016-15, divided by pro forma Operating EBITDA. Management believes cash flow conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow.

These financial measures are not recognized in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be viewed as alternatives to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, Dow's definitions may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies.

1.Pro forma adjustments include: (1) the margin impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont (included for 2019 and 2018 only), (2) the inclusion of ECP for the period of January 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, (3) the removal of the amortization of ECP's inventory step-up recognized in connection with the Merger (4) the elimination of the impact of events directly attributable to the Merger, internal reorganization and business realignment, separation, distribution and other related transactions (e.g., one-time transaction costs) and (5) the elimination of the effect of a consummated divestiture agreed to with certain regulatory agencies as a condition of approval for the Merger. See Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Liquidity & Financial Flexibility 

The Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and the Company's ability to access capital markets is expected to meet the Company’s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, contributions to pension plans, dividend distributions to stockholders, share repurchases and other needs. In addition to cash from operating activities, the Company’s current liquidity sources also include TDCC's U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs, committed credit facilities, a committed accounts receivable facility, a U.S. retail note program (“InterNotes®”) and other debt markets. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows:

Commercial Paper

TDCC issues promissory notes under its U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs. TDCC had $151 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2019 ($10 million at December 31, 2018). TDCC maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates. Amounts outstanding under TDCC's commercial paper programs during the period may be greater or less than the amount reported at the end of the period. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, TDCC issued approximately $1.5 billion of commercial paper.

Committed Credit Facilities

The Company also has the ability to access liquidity through TDCC's committed and available credit facilities. At December 31, 2019, TDCC had total committed credit facilities of $9.4 billion and available credit facilities of $7.4 billion. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on committed and available credit facilities.

In connection with the ownership restructure of Dow Silicones on May 31, 2016, Dow Silicones incurred $4.5 billion of indebtedness under a certain third party credit agreement ("Term Loan Facility"). In the second quarter of 2019, Dow Silicones voluntarily repaid $2.5 billion of principal on the Term Loan Facility. In September 2019, Dow Silicones amended the Term Loan Facility to extend the maturity date on the remaining principal balance of $2 billion, making amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility repayable in September 2021. In addition, this amendment includes options to extend the maturity date through September 2023, at Dow Silicones' election, which the Company intends to exercise. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Term Loan Facility.

Letters of Credit

TDCC utilizes letters of credit to support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. While the terms and amounts of letters of credit change, TDCC generally has approximately $400 million of outstanding letters of credit at any given time.

44
Shelf Registration - U.S.

On July 26, 2019, Dow Inc. and TDCC filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC. The shelf indicates that Dow Inc. may offer common stock; preferred stock; depositary shares; debt securities; guarantees; warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock and debt securities; and stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units, with pricing and availability of any such offerings depending on market conditions. The shelf also indicates that TDCC may offer debt securities, guarantees and warrants to purchase debt securities, with pricing and availability of any such offerings depending on market conditions. Also on July 26, 2019, TDCC filed a new prospectus supplement under this shelf registration to register an unlimited amount of securities for issuance under InterNotes®.

Debt

As the Company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure), as the Company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus "Cash and cash equivalents" and "Marketable securities." At December 31, 2019, net debt as a percent of total capitalization for Dow Inc. and TDCC increased to 50.9 percent and 49.6 percent, respectively, compared with 33.7 percent for both companies at December 31, 2018. The increase is primarily due to a reduction in stockholders' equity for both companies as a result of the separation from DowDuPont and a net loss in 2019, which was partially offset by a decrease in debt.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In 2019, the Company issued $2 billion of senior unsecured notes in an offering under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. The offering included $750 million aggregate principal amount of 4.80 percent notes due 2049; $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625 percent notes due 2026; and $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.15 percent notes due 2024. In addition, the Company redeemed $1.5 billion of 4.25 percent notes issued by the Company with maturity in 2020 and $1.25 billion of 4.125 percent notes issued by the Company with maturity in 2021.

In October 2019, TDCC launched exchange offers for $4 billion of all the outstanding, unregistered senior notes that were issued in private offerings on November 30, 2018 and May 20, 2019, for identical, registered notes under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Exchange Offers”). The Exchange Offers are with respect to the Company’s 3.15 percent notes due 2024, 4.55 percent notes due 2025, 3.625 percent notes due 2026, 4.80 percent notes due 2028, 5.55 percent notes due 2048 and 4.80 percent notes due 2049, and fulfilled the Company’s obligations contained in the registration rights agreements entered into in connection with the issuance of the aforementioned notes.

The Company may at any time repurchase certain debt securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to: the applicable terms under which any such debt securities were issued, certain internal approvals of the Company, and applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which any such potential transactions might take place. This in no way obligates the Company to make any such repurchases nor should it be considered an offer to do so.

TDCC’s public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. TDCC’s most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.65 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement ("Revolving Credit Agreement") equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of TDCC’s consolidated indebtedness as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement was 0.51 to 1.00 at December 31, 2019. Management believes TDCC was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at December 31, 2019.

45
On April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the separation of its materials science business and Dow Inc. became the direct parent company of TDCC. In conjunction with the separation, Dow Inc. is obligated, substantially concurrently with the issuance of any guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, to enter into a supplemental indenture with TDCC and the trustee under TDCC’s existing 2008 base indenture governing certain notes issued by TDCC. Under such supplemental indenture, Dow Inc. will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under such existing base indenture and will become subject to certain covenants and events of default under the existing base indenture. 

In addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event Dow Inc. incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $250 million or engages in any material activity or directly owns any material assets, in each case, subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Dow Inc. may, at its option, cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default.

No such events have occurred or have been triggered at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to TDCC’s notes payable and long-term debt activity and information on TDCC’s covenants and default provisions.

Management expects that the Company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations.

Credit Ratings

TDCC's credit ratings at January 31, 2020 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Downgrades in TDCC’s credit ratings will increase borrowing costs on certain indentures and could impact its ability to access debt capital markets.

Dividends

Dow Inc.

The following table provides dividends paid to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

1.Reflects Dow Inc. activity subsequent to the separation from DowDuPont.

2.In 2018, the common stock of Dow Inc. and TDCC was owned solely by DowDuPont and therefore the Company did not have publicly traded stock.

3.Reflects TDCC activity prior to the Merger.

TDCC

Effective with the Merger, TDCC no longer has publicly traded common stock. From the Merger date through March 31, 2019, TDCC's common shares were owned solely by DowDuPont. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, TDCC committed to fund a portion of DowDuPont's dividends paid to common stockholders and certain governance expenses. In addition, share repurchases by DowDuPont were partially funded by TDCC through 2018. Funding was accomplished through intercompany loans. On a quarterly basis, TDCC's Board of Directors reviewed and determined a dividend distribution to DowDuPont to settle the intercompany loans. The dividend distribution considered the level of TDCC’s earnings and cash flows and the outstanding intercompany loan balances. For the year ended December 31, 2019, TDCC declared and paid dividends to DowDuPont of $535 million ($3,711 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $1,056 for the year ended December 31, 2017). See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 

46
Effective with the separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. TDCC has committed to fund Dow Inc.'s dividends paid to common stockholders, share repurchases and certain governance expenses. Funding is accomplished through intercompany loans. TDCC's Board of Directors reviews and determines a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. to settle the intercompany loans. For the year ended December 31, 2019, TDCC declared and paid dividends to Dow Inc. of $201 million. At December 31, 2019, TDCC's intercompany loan balance with Dow Inc. was zero. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Share Repurchase Program

Dow Inc.

On April 1, 2019, Dow Inc.'s Board of Directors ratified the share repurchase program originally approved on March 15, 2019, authorizing up to $3 billion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. In 2019, Dow Inc. repurchased $500 million of the Company's common stock. At December 31, 2019, approximately $2.5 billion of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases. Dow Inc. expects to repurchase $250 million of the Company's common stock in 2020.

TDCC

In 2013, TDCC's Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. As a result of subsequent authorizations approved by TDCC's Board of Directors, the total authorized amount of the share repurchase program was $9.5 billion. Effective with the Merger, the share repurchase program was canceled. Over the duration of the program, a total of $8.1 billion was spent on the repurchase of TDCC Common Stock. 

Pension Plans 

The Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and a number of other countries. As a result of the Company’s separation from DowDuPont, the number of significant defined benefit pension plans administered by the Company decreased from 45 plans to 35 plans, with approximately $270 million of net unfunded pension liabilities transferred to DowDupont. Plans administered by other subsidiaries of DowDuPont that were transferred to the Company were not significant. There were no changes in the number of significant other postretirement benefit plans administered by the Company as a result of the separation. Existing Company plans that were significantly impacted by the transfer of active plan participants to DowDuPont were remeasured, resulting in curtailment gains and losses and recognition of special termination benefits.

In 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company contributed $261 million, $1,651 million and $1,672 million to its continuing operations pension plans respectively, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its non-qualified pension plans ($266 million, $1,656 million and $1,676 million, including contributions to plans of discontinued operations). In the third quarter of 2018, the Company made a $1,100 million discretionary contribution to its principal U.S. pension plan, which is included in the 2018 contribution amount above. The discretionary contribution was primarily based on the Company's funding policy, which permits contributions to defined benefit pension plans when economics encourage funding, and reflected considerations relating to tax deductibility and capital structure. 

The provisions of a U.S. non-qualified pension plan require the payment of plan obligations to certain participants upon a change in control of the Company, which occurred at the time of the Merger. Certain participants could elect to receive a lump-sum payment or direct the Company to purchase an annuity on their behalf using the after-tax proceeds of the lump sum. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company paid $940 million to plan participants and $230 million to an insurance company for the purchase of annuities, which were included in "Pension contributions" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company also paid $205 million for income and payroll taxes for participants electing the annuity option. The Company recorded a settlement charge of $687 million associated with the payout in the fourth quarter of 2017. 

The Company expects to contribute approximately $250 million to its pension plans in 2020. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Company’s pension plans.

Restructuring, Goodwill Impairment and Asset Related Charges - Net

The activities related to the Synergy Program are expected to result in additional cash payments of approximately $70 million, primarily through the second quarter of 2020, consisting of severance and related benefit costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including environmental remediation (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). The Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities; these costs will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

47
Integration and Separation Costs

Integration and separation costs, which reflect costs related to the Merger, post-Merger integration and business separation activities and costs related to the ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, were $1,063 million and $1,039 million in 2019 for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, $1,179 million in 2018 and $798 million in 2017. Integration and separation costs related to post-Merger integration and business separation activities are expected to continue in 2020 for activities primarily involving the separation of information technology infrastructure and physical plant operations. Integration and separation costs are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $200 million to $250 million through the end of 2020.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest at December 31, 2019. Additional information related to these obligations can be found in Notes 16, 17, 18 and 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

3.Includes imputed interest of $416 million.

4.Includes outstanding purchase orders and other commitments greater than $1 million obtained through a survey conducted within the Company.

5.Includes liabilities related to asbestos litigation, environmental remediation, legal settlements and other noncurrent liabilities. In addition to these items, Dow Inc. includes liabilities related to noncurrent obligations with DuPont and Corteva. The table excludes uncertain tax positions due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities and deferred tax liabilities as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact related to these liabilities. The table also excludes deferred revenue as it does not represent future cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations.

The Company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

Off-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required to consolidate these entities (see Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets.

Guarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, committed accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. The Company had outstanding guarantees at December 31, 2019 of $3,952 million, compared with $4,273 million at December 31, 2018. Additional information related to guarantees can be found in the “Guarantees” section of Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Fair Value Measurements 

See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets; see Note 23 for information related to other-than-temporary impairments; and, see Note 24 for additional information concerning fair value measurements. 

OTHER MATTERS

Recent Accounting Guidance

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recent accounting guidance.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Following are the Company’s accounting policies impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates:

Litigation 

The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business including product liability, patent infringement, employment matters, governmental tax and regulation disputes, contract and commercial litigation and other actions. The Company routinely assesses the legal and factual circumstances of each matter, the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known claim. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers covering various timeframes. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further discussion, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation

Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. ("Amchem"). Each year, Ankura Consulting Group, LLC ("Ankura") performs a review for Union Carbide based upon historical asbestos claims, resolution and asbestos-related defense and processing costs, through the terminal year of 2049. Union Carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, to the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the asbestos-related liability continues to be appropriate.

For additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters 

The Company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. At December 31, 2019, the Company had accrued obligations of $1,155 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $207 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately one and a half times that amount. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Goodwill 

The Company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by business management on a regular basis. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using 

49
qualitative and/or quantitative testing procedures. The separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019, did not impact the composition of the Company's six reporting units: Coatings & Performance Monomers, Consumer Solutions, Hydrocarbons & Energy, Industrial Solutions, Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals. The ECP businesses received as part of the separation from DowDuPont are included in the Hydrocarbons & Energy and Packaging and Specialty Plastics reporting units. At December 31, 2019, goodwill was carried by five out of six of the Company's reporting units.

The Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the Company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the Company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is required.

Quantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. This valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the Company's reporting units. However, where market comparables are available, the Company includes EBIT/EBITDA multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis. The discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions: projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates, discount rates, tax rates, terminal values, currency exchange rates, and forecasted long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, by geographic region and by year, which include the Company's key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil (due to its correlation to naphtha). Currency exchange rates and long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices are established for the Company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units, while revenue growth rates, discount rates and tax rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk. These key assumptions drive projected EBIT/EBITDA and EBIT/EBITDA margins, which are key elements of management’s internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis.

2019 Goodwill Impairment Testing 

In the fourth quarter of 2019, quantitative testing was performed on two reporting units and a qualitative assessment was performed for the remaining reporting units. For the qualitative assessments, management considered the factors at both the Company level and the reporting unit level. Based on the qualitative assessment, management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit.

Upon completion of the quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined the Coatings & Performance Monomers ("C&PM") reporting unit was impaired. During 2019, the C&PM reporting unit did not consistently meet expected financial performance targets, primarily due to the industry’s increased captive use of coatings products, which led to volume reductions, reduced margins for products across the portfolio due to changes in customer buying patterns and supply and demand balances, as well as a continued trend of customer consolidation in end markets, which reduced growth opportunities. As a result, the C&PM reporting unit lowered its future revenue and profitability projections, which were used in determining the fair value of the C&PM reporting unit using a discounted cash flow methodology. These discounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of the C&PM reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1,039 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The C&PM reporting unit did not carry a goodwill balance at December 31, 2019. The fair value of the other reporting unit exceeded its carrying value and no other goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the 2019 testing.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

As a result of the Company’s separation from DowDuPont, the number of defined benefit pension plans administered by the Company decreased from 45 plans to 35 plans, with approximately $270 million of net unfunded pension liabilities transferring to DowDuPont. Plans administered by other subsidiaries of DowDuPont that were transferred to the Company were not significant. There were no changes in the number of other postretirement benefit plans administered by the Company as a result of the separation.

The amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at December 31, 2019, rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The U.S. pension plans represent 71 percent of the Company’s pension plan assets and 70 percent of the pension obligations. 

50
The Company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the U.S. and other selected countries. Under the spot rate approach, the Company calculates service costs and interest costs by applying individual spot rates from the Willis Towers Watson RATE:Link yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost; service cost and interest cost for all other plans (including all plans prior to adoption) are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations. 

The following information relates to the U.S. plans only; a similar approach is used for the Company’s non-U.S. plans.

The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the Company's Investment Committee and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class. The Company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered. The expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience. The expected long-term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year. The weighted-average long-term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2019 was 7.92 percent. The weighted-average assumption to be used for determining 2020 net periodic pension expense is 7.95 percent. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company’s pension plans.

The discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. qualified plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the Company’s U.S. plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve (based on 60th to 90th percentile high-quality corporate bond yields) to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations decreased to 3.41 percent at December 31, 2019, from 4.39 percent at December 31, 2018.

At December 31, 2019, the U.S. qualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by $4,768 million. The underfunded amount increased $702 million compared with December 31, 2018. The increase in the underfunded amount in 2019 was primarily due to the impact of lower discount rates, which was partially offset by the reduction in the number of active U.S. pension plan participants after the Company's separation from DowDuPont. The Company did not make contributions to the U.S. qualified plans in 2019.

The assumption for the long-term rate for the compensation levels for the U.S. qualified plans was unchanged. The Company uses a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations.

The following discussion relates to the Company’s significant pension plans.

The Company bases the determination of pension expense on a market-related valuation of plan assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Over the life of the plans, both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized. At December 31, 2019, net gains of $566 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of plan assets. These net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market-related value of assets. 

The net increase in the market-related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains (losses) is presented in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

51
At December 31, 2019, the Company expects pension expense from continuing operations to increase in 2020 by approximately $125 million. The increase in pension expense is primarily due to the decrease in discount rates and curtailment gains of $27 million recognized in 2019 that are not expected to recur in 2020. 

A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the long-term return on assets assumption would change the Company’s total pension expense for 2020 by $59 million. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would lower the Company's total pension expense for 2020 by $54 million. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the Company's total pension expense for 2020 by $56 million. A 25 basis point change in the long-term return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2020.

Income Taxes

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not.

At December 31, 2019, the Company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $1,866 million, after valuation allowances of $1,262 million.

In evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, the Company relies on, in order of increasing subjectivity, taxable income in prior carryback years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results.

At December 31, 2019, the Company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $1,920 million, $295 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2020 through 2024. In order to realize these deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, the Company needs taxable income of approximately $27,010 million across multiple jurisdictions. The taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration between 2020 through 2024 is approximately $3,388 million.

The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. At December 31, 2019, the Company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of $319 million.

The Company accrues for non-income tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019, the Company had a non-income tax contingency reserve for both domestic and foreign issues of $44 million.

Indemnification Assets and Liabilities

In connection with the 2019 separation from DowDupont and the 2016 ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, Dow entered into agreements that established each party’s indemnification obligations for certain tax, environmental, litigation and other matters, subject to certain conditions and limits. The Company records indemnification assets when collection is deemed probable and engages with indemnifying parties and assesses publicly available information to evaluate collectability. The underlying tax, environmental, litigation and other liabilities for which the Company claims indemnification are subject to significant judgment and potential disputes could adversely impact collectability. The Company assesses the collectability of indemnification assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. At December 31, 2019, indemnification assets were $210 million and $100 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC respectively (zero for both at December 31, 2018). 

The Company records indemnification liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. At December 31, 2019, indemnification liabilities related to the agreements were $848 million for Dow Inc. and zero for TDCC (zero for both at December 31, 2018). This represents management’s best estimate of the Company’s obligations under the agreements, although it is reasonably possible that future events could cause the actual values to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded. For further discussion, see Notes 4 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Environmental Matters

Environmental Policies 

Dow is committed to world-class environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) performance, as demonstrated by industry-leading performance, a long-standing commitment to Responsible Care®, and a strong commitment to achieve the Company's 2025 Sustainability Goals – goals that set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry by focusing on improvements in the Company’s local corporate citizenship and product stewardship, and by actively pursuing methods to reduce its environmental impact.

To meet the Company’s public commitments, as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject, the Company has well-defined policies, requirements and management systems. The Company's EH&S Management System (“EMS”) defines the “who, what, when and how” needed for the businesses to achieve the Company’s policies, requirements, performance objectives, leadership expectations and public commitments. To ensure effective utilization, the EMS is integrated into a company-wide management system for EH&S, Operations, Quality and Human Resources.

It is the Company's policy to adhere to a waste management hierarchy that minimizes the impact of wastes and emissions on the environment. First, work to eliminate or minimize the generation of waste and emissions at the source through research, process design, plant operations and maintenance. Second, find ways to reuse and recycle materials. Finally, unusable or non-recyclable hazardous waste is treated before disposal to eliminate or reduce the hazardous nature and volume of the waste. Treatment may include destruction by chemical, physical, biological or thermal means. Disposal of waste materials in landfills is considered only after all other options have been thoroughly evaluated. The Company has specific requirements for waste that is transferred to non-Dow facilities, including the periodic auditing of these facilities.

The Company believes third-party verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of world-class EH&S performance and building public trust. Numerous Dow sites in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and U.S. & Canada have received third-party verification of the Company’s compliance with Responsible Care® and with outside specifications such as ISO-14001. The Company continues to be a global champion of Responsible Care® and has worked to broaden the application and impact of Responsible Care® around the world through engagement with suppliers, customers and joint venture partners.

The Company’s EH&S policies helped to achieve improvements in many aspects of EH&S performance in 2019. The Company’s process safety performance was excellent in 2019 and improvements were made in injury/illness rates, and safety remains a priority. Further improvement in these areas, as well as environmental compliance, remains a top management priority, with initiatives underway to further improve performance and compliance in 2020 as the Company continues to implement the 2025 Sustainability Goals.

Detailed information on Dow’s performance regarding environmental matters and goals can be found online on the Company's Science & Sustainability webpage at www.dow.com/sustainability. The website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report.

Chemical Security 

Public and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure, including the chemical industry, from security threats. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and cyber incidents have increased concern about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. Many, including the Company and the American Chemistry Council, have called for uniform risk-based and performance-based national standards for securing the U.S. chemical industry. The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and its regulations further set forth risk-based and performance-based standards that must be met at U.S. Coast Guard-regulated facilities. U.S. Chemical Plant Security legislation was passed in 2006 and the Department of Homeland Security is now implementing the regulations known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. The Company is complying with the requirements of the Rail Transportation Security Rule issued by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. The Company continues to support uniform risk-based national standards for securing the chemical industry.

The focus on security, emergency planning, preparedness and response is not new to the Company. A comprehensive, multi-level security plan has been maintained since 1988. This plan, which has been activated in response to significant world and national events since then, is reviewed on an annual basis. The Company continues to improve its security plans, placing emphasis on the safety of Dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks. The security plan includes regular vulnerability assessments, security audits, mitigation efforts and physical security upgrades designed to reduce vulnerability. The Company’s security plans also are developed to avert interruptions of normal business operations that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

53
The Company played a key role in the development and implementation of the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care® Security Code ("Security Code"), which requires that all aspects of security – including facility, transportation and cyberspace – be assessed and gaps addressed. Through the global implementation of the Security Code, the Company has permanently heightened the level of security – not just in the U.S., but worldwide. The Company employs several hundred employees and contractors in its Emergency Services and Security department worldwide. In 2019, the Company established its Global Security Operations Center ("GSOC") to provide 24-hour/day, 365-day/year real-time monitoring of global risks to Dow assets and people. The GSOC employs state-of-the-art social media monitoring, threat reporting and geo-fencing capabilities to analyze global risks and report those risks facilitating decision-making and actions to prevent Dow crises.

Through the implementation of the Security Code, including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades made since 2002, the Company is well-positioned to comply with U.S. chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks. The Company is currently participating with the American Chemistry Council to review and update the Security Code.

The Company continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on Responsible Care®, Supply Chain Design, Emergency Preparedness, Shipment Visibility and transportation of hazardous materials. The Company is cooperating with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design, and track and trace technologies. Further, the Company’s Distribution Risk Review process that has been in place for decades was expanded to address potential threats in all modes of transportation across the Company’s supply chain. To reduce vulnerabilities, the Company maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which they operate.

The Company's initiatives relative to chemical security, emergency preparedness and response, Community Awareness and Emergency Responses and crisis management are implemented consistently at all Dow sites on a global basis. The Company participates with chemical associations globally and participates as an active member of the U.S. delegation to the G7 Global Partnership Sub-Working Group on Chemical Security.

Climate Change 

Climate change matters for the Company are likely to be driven by changes in regulations, public policy and physical climate parameters.

Regulatory Matters

Regulatory matters include cap and trade schemes; increased greenhouse gas (“GHG”) limits; and taxes on GHG emissions, fuel and energy. The potential implications of each of these matters are all very similar, including increased cost of purchased energy, additional capital costs for installation or modification of GHG emitting equipment, and additional costs associated directly with GHG emissions (such as cap and trade systems or carbon taxes), which are primarily related to energy use. It is difficult to estimate the potential impact of these regulatory matters on energy prices.

Reducing the Company's overall energy usage and GHG emissions through new and unfolding projects will decrease the potential impact of these regulatory matters. The Company also has a dedicated commercial group to handle energy contracts and purchases, including managing emissions trading. The Company has not experienced any material impact related to regulated GHG emissions, and continues to evaluate and monitor this area for future developments.

Physical Climate Parameters

Many scientific academies throughout the world have concluded that it is very likely that human activities are contributing to global warming. At this point, it is difficult to predict and assess the probability and opportunity of a global warming trend on the Company specifically. Preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather. These measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness. Dow continues to study the long-term implications of changing climate parameters on water availability, plant siting issues, and impacts and opportunities for products.

Dow’s Energy business and Public Affairs and Sustainability functions are tasked with developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy that addresses the potential challenges of energy security and GHG emissions on the Company. Dow continues to elevate its internal focus and external positions - to focus on the root causes of GHG emissions - including the unsustainable use of energy. The Company's energy plan provides the roadmap: 

•Conserve - aggressively pursue energy efficiency and conservation

•Optimize - increase and diversify energy resources

•Accelerate - develop cost-effective, clean, renewable and alternative energy sources 

•Transition - to a sustainable energy future 

54
Through corporate energy efficiency programs and focused GHG management efforts, the Company has and is continuing to reduce its GHG emissions footprint. Dow’s manufacturing intensity, measured in Btu per pound of product, has improved by more than 40 percent since 1990. As part of the 2025 Sustainability Goals, the Company will maintain GHG emissions below 2006 levels on an absolute basis for all GHGs. 

The Company intends to implement the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ("Task Force") over the next three years, which is aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force.

Environmental Remediation

The Company accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory requirements. The nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination. The accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To assess the impact on the financial statements, environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and the ability to apply remediation technologies. These liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. The Company had an accrued liability of $948 million at December 31, 2019, related to the remediation of current or former Dow-owned sites. At December 31, 2018, the liability related to remediation was $654 million.

In addition to current and former Dow-owned sites, under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and equivalent state laws (hereafter referred to collectively as "Superfund Law"), the Company is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where the Company allegedly disposed of, or arranged for the treatment or disposal of, hazardous substances. Because Superfund Law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site, the Company has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that also have been named potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at each site, the estimated apportionment of costs among all PRPs, and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share. The Company’s remaining liability for the remediation of Superfund sites was $207 million at December 31, 2019 ($156 million at December 31, 2018). The Company has not recorded any third-party recovery related to these sites as a receivable.

Information regarding environmental sites is provided below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

2.Superfund sites are sites, including sites not owned by the Company, where remediation obligations are imposed by Superfund Law.

Additional information is provided below for the Company’s Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site and Midland off-site locations (collectively, the "Midland sites"), as well as a Superfund site in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the locations for which the Company has the largest potential environmental liabilities.

In the early days of operations at the Midland manufacturing site, wastes were usually disposed of on-site, resulting in soil and groundwater contamination, which has been contained and managed on-site under a series of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permits and regulatory agreements. The Hazardous Waste Operating License for the Midland manufacturing site, issued in 2003, and renewed and replaced in September 2015, also included provisions for the Company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination from historic Midland manufacturing site operations. In January 2010, the Company, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and the State of Michigan ("State") entered into an Administrative Order on Consent that requires the Company to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of CERCLA. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to Midland off-site environmental matters. 

Rohm and Haas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a PRP at the Wood-Ridge, New Jersey Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site, and the adjacent Berry’s Creek Study Area ("BCSA") (collectively, the "Wood-Ridge sites"). Rohm and Haas is a successor 

55
in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility, where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments. In 2018, the Berry’s Creek Study Area Potentially Responsible Party Group (“PRP Group”), consisting of over 100 PRPs, completed a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study for the BCSA. During that time, the EPA concluded that an “iterative or adaptive approach” was appropriate for cleaning up the BCSA. Thus, each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work. In September 2018, the EPA signed a Record of Decision ("ROD 1") which describes the initial phase of the EPA’s plan to clean-up the BCSA. ROD 1 will remediate waterways and major tributaries in the most contaminated part of the BCSA. The PRP Group has signed agreements with the EPA to design the selected remedy. Although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the BCSA and Rohm and Haas's share of these costs has yet to be determined, the range of activities that are required in the interim Record of Decision is known in general terms.

At December 31, 2019, the Company had accrued liabilities totaling $368 million ($240 million at December 31, 2018) for environmental remediation at the Midland and Wood-Ridge sites. In 2019, the Company spent $32 million ($32 million in 2018) for environmental remediation at the Midland and Wood-Ridge sites. 

During the third quarter of 2019, the Company accrued additional liabilities totaling $447 million related to environmental remediation matters at a number of current and historical locations. The additional accrual primarily resulted from: the culmination of long-standing negotiations and discussions with regulators and agencies, including technical studies supporting higher cost estimates for final or staged remediation plans; the Company’s evaluation of the cost required to manage remediation activities at sites affected by Dow’s separation from DowDuPont and related agreements with Corteva and DuPont; and, the Company’s review of its closure strategies and obligations to monitor ongoing operations and maintenance activities. In addition, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $48 million related to Dow Silicones’ environmental matters. Net of indemnifications, the Company recognized a pretax charge of $399 million related to these environmental matters, included in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income. 

In total, the Company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was $1,155 million at December 31, 2019, compared with $810 million at December 31, 2018. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately one and a half times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.

The amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $588 million in 2019, $176 million in 2018 and $163 million in 2017. The amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the Company's current pollution abatement facilities, excluding internal recharges, totaled $677 million in 2019, $695 million in 2018 and $566 million in 2017. Capital expenditures for environmental protection were $83 million in 2019, $55 million in 2018 and $57 million in 2017. 

Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation

Union Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products.

The table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

56
Plaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. In fact, there are no asbestos personal injury cases in which only Union Carbide and/or Amchem are the sole named defendants. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide’s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.

For additional information see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
