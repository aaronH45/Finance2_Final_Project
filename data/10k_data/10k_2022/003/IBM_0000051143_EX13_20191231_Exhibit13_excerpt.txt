Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings

In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, management separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization, expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs and discontinued operations and their related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments, among others, include true-ups, accounting elections, any changes to regulations, laws and audit adjustments that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company’s acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any

plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business.

Overall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. Our reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with our management and measurement system. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts.

In 2019, we reported $77.1 billion in revenue, $9.4 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $11.4 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.57 as reported and $12.81 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We also generated $14.8 billion in cash from operations, $11.9 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $7.1 billion in dividends and gross common stock repurchases. These results reflect solid performance in key high-value areas as we continued to strengthen our foundation for the next chapter of our clients’ digital reinventions. During 2019, we completed the acquisition of Red Hat and have started to benefit from the synergies of IBM and Red Hat together. We continued to bring new innovations to the market, launching the new z15, delivering new high-end storage and modernizing and containerizing our software portfolio. We have expanded our services offerings and skills for the cloud journey and the reach of our Watson/AI offerings. We also divested select businesses as we continue to prioritize our investments and optimize our portfolio for this next chapter in cloud.

Total consolidated revenue decreased 3.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Excluding divested businesses, revenue increased 0.2 percent adjusted for currency. Cloud & Cognitive Software increased 4.5 percent as reported and 6 percent adjusted for currency, with strong results from the contribution of Red Hat beginning in the third quarter. Cloud & Data Platforms, which includes Red Hat, grew 10.4 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency), Cognitive Applications increased 2.3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency), while Transaction Processing Platforms declined 0.5 percent as reported but grew 1 percent adjusted for currency. Global Business Services (GBS) grew 0.2 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency led by Consulting which grew 3.7 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) with year-to-year improvement in each quarter of 2019. Global Technology Services (GTS) decreased 6.1 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency with declines in Infrastructure & Cloud Services and Technology Support Services. Performance in Infrastructure & Cloud Services was impacted by lower in-period revenue from client business volumes, while the decline in Technology Support Services was primarily due to transitions in the hardware product cycle. As we continued to take actions to accelerate the shift to the higher value segments of the market opportunity, there was solid growth in the cloud offerings within GTS. Systems decreased 5.3 percent year to year as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency. IBM Z decreased 1.1 percent (flat adjusted for currency) reflecting product cycle dynamics. There was a year-to-year decline through the first three quarters of the year at the end of the z14 product cycle, but strong growth in the fourth quarter after shipment of the new z15 mainframe began in the last week of September. Storage Systems declined 8.9 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) with improved year-to-year performance in the second half of the year and growth in the fourth quarter led by high-end products. Power Systems declined 13.5 percent (12 percent adjusted for currency) compared with strong performance in the prior year. Across the segments, total IBM cloud revenue of $21.2 billion in 2019 grew 11 percent as reported and 13 percent adjusted for currency and represented 27 percent of our total 2019 revenue.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 1.9 percent year to year as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency), but grew 1 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency. Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) decreased 4.1 percent (flat adjusted for currency), but grew 1 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific declined 4.0 percent year to year as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) and 2 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency.

The consolidated gross margin of 47.3 percent increased 0.9 points year to year, and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 48.0 percent increased 1.1 points versus the prior year. The improved margins in 2019 reflect the actions we have taken to focus on higher value and portfolio optimization while also driving productivity and operational efficiency.

Total expense and other (income) increased 2.8 percent in 2019 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by higher spending including investment to deliver new innovations, Red Hat operational spending and interest expense from debt issuances to fund the acquisition (8 points), amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operating activity related to the Red Hat acquisition (3 points) and a decrease in intellectual property (IP) income (1 point), partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs (4 points), gains from divestitures (3 points) and the impact of currency (3 points). Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 4.1 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and other non-operating activity related to the Red Hat acquisition.

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $10.2 billion decreased 10.4 percent and the pre-tax margin was 13.2 percent, a decrease of 1.1 points versus 2018. The second half of 2019 was impacted by the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment and Red Hat acquisition-related activity. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2019 was 7.2 percent, a decrease of 15.9 points compared to 2018. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by a charge of $2.0 billion in 2018 for U.S. tax reform. Net income from continuing operations of $9.4 billion increased 8.2 percent and the net income from continuing operations margin was 12.2 percent, up 1.3 points year to year primarily due to the 2018 $2.0 billion charge for U.S. tax reform. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $12.5 billion decreased 9.0 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 1.1 points to 16.2 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2019 was 8.5 percent, an increase of 0.7 points compared to 2018. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $11.4 billion decreased 9.6 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 14.8 percent was down 1.1 points year to year driven primarily by the Red Hat deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment and acquisition-related activity.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.57 in 2019 increased 11.1 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $12.81 decreased 7.2 percent versus 2018. In 2019, we repurchased 10.0 million shares of common stock at a cost of $1.3 billion before the share repurchase program was suspended at the time of the Red Hat closing.

At December 31, 2019, we continued to have the financial flexibility to support the business. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $9.0 billion, a decrease of $3.2 billion from December 31, 2018 as we had built up our cash position in advance of the closing of the Red Hat acquisition. Goodwill and intangible assets increased $34.1 billion and total debt increased $17.1 billion since December 31, 2018, primarily due to the Red Hat acquisition. With strong cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow, and disciplined financial management, we significantly deleveraged in the second half of 2019.

Total assets increased $28.8 billion (increased $29.0 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2018 primarily driven by:

●Increases in goodwill of $22.0 billion and net intangible assets of $12.1 billion primarily associated with the acquisition of Red Hat; and

●An increase in operating right-of-use assets of $5.0 billion resulting from the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019; partially offset by

●A decrease in financing receivables of $8.6 billion primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.

Total liabilities increased $24.7 billion (increased $25.0 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2018 driven by:

●An increase in total debt of $17.1 billion primarily driven by new issuances to finance the Red Hat acquisition; and

●An increase in operating lease liabilities of $5.3 billion resulting from the adoption of the new leasing standard.

Total equity of $21.0 billion increased $4.1 billion from December 31, 2018 as a result of:

●Increases from net income of $9.4 billion and retirement related plans of $1.4 billion; partially offset by

●Decreases from dividends of $5.7 billion and gross share repurchases of $1.3 billion.

Cash provided by operating activities was $14.8 billion in 2019, a decrease of $0.5 billion compared to 2018, driven primarily by an increase in cash income tax payments ($0.3 billion), an increase in interest payments on debt ($0.3 billion) driven by incremental debt used to fund the acquisition of Red Hat, and performance-related declines within net income, including lower operating cash flows due to businesses divested in 2019; partially offset by an increase in cash provided by financing receivables ($0.8 billion).

Net cash used in investing activities of $26.9 billion was $22.0 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in net cash used for acquisitions ($32.5 billion) driven by the acquisition of Red Hat. This was partially offset by an increase in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($7.2 billion) primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations, a decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures ($1.3 billion) and an increase in cash provided by divestitures ($1.1 billion).

Financing activities were a net source of cash of $9.0 billion in 2019 compared to a net use of cash of $10.5 billion in 2018. The year-to-year increase in cash flow of $19.5 billion was driven by an increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions ($16.6 billion) primarily driven by net issuances to fund the Red Hat acquisition and a decrease in cash used for gross common stock repurchases ($3.1 billion).

In January 2020, the company disclosed that it is expecting GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations of at least $10.57 and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of at least $13.35 per diluted share for 2020. The company expects free cash flow to be approximately $12.5 billion in 2020. Refer to the Looking Forward section for additional information on the company’s expectations.

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Please refer to IBM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020, for Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.”

We create value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. IBM solutions typically create value by enabling new capabilities for clients that transform their businesses and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

IBM Strategy

IBM’s strategy begins with our clients. IBM is distinguished as being first and foremost an Enterprise company, serving the world’s leaders in their industries.

Serving enterprises requires a distinct set of skills as our clients entrust us with building, integrating and running the world’s mission-critical systems. These are systems that cannot fail, systems that require the highest levels of privacy and security. They are built with our software and on our systems, designed and managed by IBM services. For example, we manage approximately ninety percent of the credit card transactions and half of the world’s wireless connections. We do this with an unparalleled commitment to our clients’ data security.

We are unique in bringing innovative technology and industry expertise on a foundation of trust and security as an integrated proposition to our clients. This integrated proposition allows us to deliver business impact that matters to our clients, impact that requires bringing together technologies such as hybrid cloud, data and AI insight with workflow and advanced industry skills. This integrated proposition helps our clients transform themselves from traditional businesses to what we call Cognitive Enterprises.

Furthermore, as technology becomes more central for business, as well as in our personal lives, trust matters more than ever. For decades we have followed core principles grounded in commitments to trust and transparency that guide our responsible development and deployment of new technologies. These values ground our business decisions, inspire our employees, and sustain our client relationships. We have not only followed guidelines around the responsible handling of data and the stewardship of new technology, but created them, published them and invited others to adopt similar commitments. Our focus is not just on our direct client work, but extends to society at large, as we have been very active in areas such as education, sustainability and security. This is reinforced through a culture of inclusion and diversity. All of IBM treats this “responsible stewardship” as core to our mission.

A New Chapter in Technology

2019 ushered in Chapter 2 of our clients’ digital journeys in which the two predominant technology forces of our day–hybrid cloud and data/AI–are moving from “start-up” to “production at scale”. These two forces work together to help companies become what we call Cognitive Enterprises–companies that are powered by innovation, agility and data-driven intelligent decision making.

We describe below how IBM is leading the way in Chapter 2.

Hybrid Cloud

Chapter 1 marked the early stages of cloud with the rise of public cloud. This stage was focused on new end-user applications, including applications that have allowed consumers to check their bank balances, access social media, make online purchases and receive online support. While movement to public cloud has been strong, only twenty percent of workloads have been addressed in Chapter 1. Clients are merely at the beginning of a multi-stage journey.

Chapter 2 is about clients modernizing the remaining eighty percent of workloads, moving mission-critical workloads to the cloud and infusing AI deep into the decision-making of their businesses. These mission-critical workloads include core financial transaction systems, customer databases and Enterprise Resource Planning systems. Some of these workloads will gravitate to the public cloud in Chapter 2, while others will move to a private cloud or remain in traditional IT environments for security, compliance and/or performance reasons.

Wherever clients’ workloads reside, these environments must work together seamlessly to communicate, share data and share capacity. With enterprises having accumulated as many as fifteen public clouds, each with its own means of management, harmonizing these different clouds has become a necessity. Bringing these multiple public clouds, private cloud and traditional IT together is what we call hybrid cloud. Hybrid cloud defines the mission for Chapter 2 in IT.

We are a leader in hybrid cloud, and our mission in Chapter 2 is to bring our expertise and experience in building and managing mission-critical systems to lead our enterprise clients along this multi-stage journey.

Our public cloud is built on a foundation of open source software and enterprise grade infrastructure. It is the most open and secure public cloud, and it is built for the enterprise with Cloud Paks–enterprise-ready, containerized software solutions for applications, automation, data, integration and multi-cloud management.

To accelerate our clients’ success, we acquired Red Hat in 2019, further strengthening our leadership in hybrid cloud. Red Hat is the world’s leader in open source technology, including Enterprise Linux, the operating system of the cloud, as well as containers and OpenShift, technology platforms that create seamless integration between traditional and cloud environments. As the leader in open source, Red Hat brings capability that enables applications to be “written once and run anywhere”, in turn helping companies avoid lock-in to a single cloud provider, thereby taking advantage of the entire industry’s innovation. These technologies are central to the next era of computing.

Our systems and services play a large role in these hybrid cloud offerings as well. We have introduced new versions of our systems that work securely and seamlessly in the hybrid cloud, bringing mission-critical workloads into our clients’ digital journeys. Through our services, we play a large role in helping our clients map out their digital journeys, and then helping them build, manage and run the technology and the workflows.

This integrated value proposition of innovative technology and industry expertise built on trust and security, and now together with Red Hat, is helping our clients realize the full potential and competitive advantage of the hybrid cloud.

Data and AI

A new era of business reinvention is emerging as leading companies are moving from merely improving their processes to creating truly “intelligent workflows,” processes that are not only efficient at what they do, but intrinsically smart: capable of finding, connecting and analyzing data to uncover deep insights that can inform intelligent decisions. Data and AI, in concert with hybrid cloud, are making intelligent workflows possible.

We have been a pioneer of technologies and services that help clients collect, organize, and analyze their vast data stores and then operationalize AI across their business. Our long-running innovation in automation, data science, and natural language processing is helping clients manage their data as a strategic resource and deploy AI for greater insight and more accurate, trusted predictions.

Our data offerings help clients organize, collect, analyze and embed their data into their workflow. IBM software spans areas ranging from data management and discovery to reporting, governance, compliance and risk management. Our systems process our clients’ data with unparalleled speed, accuracy and security and our services help clients capture and embed the value of their data into their business.

Our IBM Watson AI system has been named by industry analysts as the worldwide market leader in AI for three consecutive years. Watson is not only a leading AI technology, but a leader in enterprise deployments in production and at scale. In addition to extracting deep insight from data, IBM Watson allows clients to trace the origins of the data that their AI models use, explain what is behind their recommendations and ensure that bias has not crept into results. Furthermore, IBM Watson is the only system that is built for the hybrid cloud, able to work on numerous public and private clouds. These innovations are making AI more consumable by everyday users, not just data scientists.

Creating intelligent workflows relies on our integrated proposition of technology, services and industry expertise, built on a foundation of trust and security. The way in which we bring these together is through an interactive process with our clients that we call the IBM Garage, a process of deep collaboration, co-creation and innovation.

* * * * *

We are in an era when our clients are embedding technology into their businesses in ways they have never done before. Technology is no longer merely a “tool”, it is at the center of their businesses, the source of their competitive advantage and the force behind their emerging business models.

In Chapter 2, IBM is bringing hybrid cloud and data/AI together to help our clients reinvent themselves as Cognitive Enterprises. The most challenging and complex work still lies ahead. With our strong commitment to responsible stewardship and our integrated value proposition, this makes us unique in helping our clients on their transformative digital journeys.

Business Model

Our business model is built to provide long-term value to stakeholders. We bring together innovative technology, industry expertise and a commitment to trust and transparency to help enterprise clients move from one era to the next. We provide integrated solutions and platforms, leveraging global capabilities that include services, software, systems, related financings and fundamental research. The business model has been developed over time through strategic investments in capabilities and technologies that have long-term growth and profitability prospects based on the value they deliver to clients.

The business model is dynamic, adapting to the continuously changing industry and economic environment, including our shift to cloud delivery models. We continue to strengthen our position through strategic organic investments and acquisitions in higher-value areas, broadening our industry expertise and integrating AI into more of what we offer. In addition, we are transforming into a more agile enterprise to drive innovation and speed, as well as helping to drive productivity, which supports investments for participation in markets with significant long-term opportunity. We also regularly evaluate our portfolio and investments, proactively bringing products to end of life, engaging in IP partnerships and executing divestitures to optimize our portfolio.

This business model, supported by our financial model, has enabled IBM to deliver strong earnings, cash flows and returns to shareholders over the long term.

Global Financing encompasses two primary businesses: financing, primarily conducted through IBM Credit LLC (IBM Credit), and remanufacturing and remarketing. IBM Credit is a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM that accesses the capital markets directly. IBM Credit, through its financing solutions, facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services in the areas where we have expertise. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end users’ business operations. Global Financing conducts a comprehensive credit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Global Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also maintains a long-term partnership with IBM’s clients through various stages of the IT asset life cycle–from initial purchase and technology upgrades to asset disposition decisions.

Global Financing Capabilities

Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven years. Assets financed are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where we have expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Technology Services’ long-term client service contracts. All internal financing arrangements are at arm’s-length rates and are based upon market conditions.

Commercial Financing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers of IBM. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, we wound down the portion of our commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) IT suppliers, distributors and resellers. This wind down is consistent with IBM’s capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. Commercial Financing also includes internal activity where Global Financing factors a selected portion of IBM’s accounts receivable primarily for cash management purposes, at arm’s-length rates. This program was suspended in the second quarter of 2019.

Remanufacturing and Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be refurbished or upgraded, and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Global Technology Services. Systems may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients.

IBM Worldwide Organizations

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM’s delivery of value to its clients:

●Global Markets

●Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Global Markets

IBM operates in more than 175 countries with a broad distribution of revenue. To manage this global footprint, Global Markets leads our dedicated country-based IBM operations in order to serve clients, develop markets, and ultimately, ensure IBM is led through a client lens.

These integrated teams serve our clients locally, complemented by digital capabilities, global talent and resources, and an extensive partner ecosystem. These country teams have client relationship managers at their center, who integrate teams of IBM consultants, solution specialists, delivery professionals and business partners on behalf of clients. Their mission is to provide insights and innovation and co-create with clients to help them address their most pressing business challenges and opportunities.

In this way, we serve as a trusted partner to clients, establishing and maintaining relationships that deliver long-term value based on industry expertise, innovative technologies and an ability to deliver mission critical capabilities to an enterprise at scale.

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Our research and development (R&D) operations differentiate us from our competitors. In 2019, we invested approximately 8 percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and our business units through global labs on near-and mid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to our portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, security, cloud, systems and more–applying these technologies across industries including financial services, healthcare, manufacturing and automotive.

In 2019, for the 27th consecutive year, IBM was awarded more U.S. patents than any other company. IBM’s 9,262 patents awarded in 2019 represent a diverse range of inventions in strategic growth areas for the company, including more than 4,500 patents related to work in artificial intelligence, cloud, cybersecurity and quantum computing.

We actively continue to seek IP protection for our innovations, while increasing emphasis on other initiatives designed to leverage our IP leadership. Some of our technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of our business model, we license certain of our IP assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more mature markets. The licensee drives the future development of the IP and ultimately expands the customer base. This generates IP income for IBM both upon licensing, and with any ongoing royalty arrangements between it and the licensee. While our various proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. IBM owns or is licensed under a number of patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products.

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

** 2019 results were impacted by Red Hat purchase accounting and acquisition-related activity.

The Cloud & Cognitive Software gross profit margin decreased 0.9 points to 76.7 percent in 2019 compared to the prior year. The gross profit margin decline was driven by the purchase price accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition.

Pre-tax income of $7,952 million decreased 10.5 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin decline of 4.4 points to 30.6 percent which reflects the acquisition of Red Hat, ongoing investments in key strategic areas and lower income from IP partnership agreements.

Global Business Services[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

GBS revenue of $16,634 million increased 0.2 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency in 2019 compared to the prior year. The strong growth in Consulting reflected GBS’ ability to bring together our industry specific expertise and innovative technology portfolio to help clients with their digital reinventions. Our performance reflects continued investment in offerings and capabilities to help advise clients and move their applications to hybrid multi-cloud environments. In the second half, we saw an acceleration in new Red Hat engagements.

The GBS profit margin increased 0.9 points to 27.7 percent and pre-tax income of $1,666 million increased 2.2 percent year to year. The pre-tax margin of 9.9 percent increased slightly year to year. The year-to-year improvements in margins and pre-tax income were driven by the continued mix shift to higher-value offerings, the yield from delivery productivity improvements and a currency benefit from leveraging the global delivery resource model. We continued to invest in our services offerings and skills necessary to assist our clients on their cloud journey.

Global Technology Services[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

GTS revenue of $27,361 million decreased 6.1 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2019 compared to the prior year. We had continued growth in cloud services that help clients move and manage workloads. However, performance reflected lower client business volumes in more traditional labor-based managed services. We continue to take actions to accelerate the shift to higher-value segments of the market and are introducing new managed services offerings for public and private cloud, in areas like cybersecurity, data management and hybrid orchestration. We are investing in joint services offerings integrating GTS and GBS, and deploying joint go-to-market capabilities, as clients demand solutions that merge applications and infrastructure. Although lower business volumes impacted full-year revenue and profit in 2019, we ended the year with growth in cloud signings and a solid pipeline of future deals that will deliver productivity to our clients.

Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue of $20,736 million decreased 6.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Revenue was impacted by our customers’ own business volumes which were lower year to year in certain offerings. Clients are modernizing their core infrastructures to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructures. GTS is continuing to invest in cloud capabilities, introduce new managed services offerings and build out its cloud data center footprint to capture this opportunity. Growth in cloud signings reflects our re-alignment of GTS offerings to help our clients on their journey to cloud, infusing offerings with IP and leveraging Red Hat’s capabilities.

Technology Support Services (TSS) revenue of $6,625 million decreased 4.8 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) in 2019, partially driven by dynamics in the hardware product cycles.

Within GTS, cloud revenue of $8.6 billion grew 8 percent as reported and 10 percent adjusted for currency.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The GTS gross profit margin increased 0.3 points year to year to 34.8 percent, due to the benefits of workforce actions and the continued scale out of our public cloud. We continued to take structural actions to improve our cost competitiveness and are accelerating the use of AI and automation in delivery operations, including leveraging Red Hat’s Ansible platform. Pre-tax income of $1,645 million decreased 7.6 percent, driven primarily by the decline in revenue and gross profit, and a higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the current year. Pre-tax margin of 5.8 percent was essentially flat year to year, with the 2019 pre-tax margin reflecting benefits from structural and workforce actions.

Services Backlog and Signings[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The estimated total services backlog at December 31, 2019 was $112 billion, a decrease of 3.1 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency).

Total services backlog includes Infrastructure & Cloud Services, Security Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and TSS. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either noncancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the company’s clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.

Services signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.

Signings include Infrastructure & Cloud Services, Security Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. TSS is generally not included in signings as the maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings.

Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Systems[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Systems revenue of $7,604 million decreased 5.3 percent year to year as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). Systems Hardware revenue of $5,918 million declined 7.0 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems. Operating Systems Software revenue of $1,686 million grew 0.9 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.

Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue decreased 1.1 percent as reported but was essentially flat adjusted for currency, reflecting the mainframe product cycles. Revenue declined through the first three quarters due to the end of the z14 product cycle, but there was strong growth in the fourth quarter driven by z15 shipments. The z15’s strong performance demonstrates client demand for technology that offers improved data privacy and resiliency in the hybrid cloud environment. The z15

mainframe’s capabilities extend the platform’s differentiation with encryption everywhere, cloud-native development and instant recovery. In October, we announced OpenShift for IBM Z, bringing together the industry’s most comprehensive enterprise container and Kubernetes platform with the enterprise server platforms of IBM Z and LinuxONE. IBM Z continues to deliver a high-value, secure and scalable platform for our clients.

Power Systems revenue decreased 13.5 percent as reported (12 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, due to the strong performance during the second half of 2018 driven by Linux and the introduction of the POWER9-based architecture in our mid-range and high-end products.

Storage Systems revenue decreased 8.9 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, with improvements in year-to-year performance in the fourth quarter of 2019, driven primarily by the launch of the next generation high-end storage system DS8900 in November.

Within Systems, cloud revenue of $2.9 billion declined 4 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The Systems gross profit margin increased 3.2 points to 53.1 percent in 2019 compared to the prior year. The increase was driven by actions taken in 2018 to better position the cost structure over the longer term, a mix to IBM Z hardware and operating systems and margin improvement in Storage Systems.

Pre-tax income of $701 million declined 22.4 percent and pre-tax margin of 8.4 percent decreased 1.8 points year to year driven by the declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems revenue and the continued investment in innovation across the Systems portfolio, mitigated by the benefit from the new hardware launches in the second-half 2019.

Global Financing

Global Financing is a reportable segment that is measured as a stand-alone entity. Global Financing facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services by providing financing solutions in the areas where the company has expertise, while generating strong returns on equity. Global Financing also optimizes the recovery of residual values by selling assets sourced from end of lease, leasing used equipment to new clients, or extending lease arrangements with current clients. Sales of equipment include equipment returned at the end of a lease, surplus internal equipment and used equipment purchased externally. Residual value is a risk unique to the financing business and management of this risk is dependent upon the ability to accurately project future equipment values at lease inception. Global Financing has insight into product plans and cycles for both the IBM and OEM IT products under lease. Based upon this product information, Global Financing continually monitors projections of future equipment values and compares them with the residual values reflected in the portfolio.

Results of Operations[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

In 2019, Global Financing delivered external revenue of $1,400 million and total revenue of $2,632 million, with a decrease in gross margin of 2.7 points to 58.8 percent. Total pre-tax income of $1,055 million decreased 22.5 percent compared to 2018 and return on equity decreased 5.0 points to 25.8 percent.

Global Financing total revenue decreased 17.8 percent compared to the prior year. This was due to a decrease in internal revenue of 23.5 percent, driven by decreases in internal used equipment sales (down 27.4 percent to $862 million) and internal financing (down 12.6 percent to $370 million). External revenue declined 11.9 percent due to decreases in external financing (down 8.5 percent to $1,120 million) and external used equipment sales (down 23.4 percent to $281 million).

​

Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

The decrease in internal financing revenue was due to lower average asset balances, partially offset by higher asset yields. The decrease in external financing revenue reflects the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations.

Sales of used equipment represented 43.4 percent and 48.5 percent of Global Financing’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in 2019 was due to a lower volume of internal used equipment sales. The gross profit margin on used sales was 52.2 percent and 54.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in the gross profit margin was driven by lower margins on internal used equipment sales.

Global Financing pre-tax income decreased 22.5 percent year to year primarily driven by a decrease in gross profit ($422 million), partially offset by a decrease in total expense ($115 million), which was mainly driven by a decline in IBM shared expenses in line with the segment’s performance, a lower provision for credit losses and a gain from the sale of certain commercial financing capabilities in the first quarter of 2019. 

The decrease in return on equity from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to lower net income. Refer to page 45 for the details of the after-tax income and return on equity calculations.

Geographic Revenue

In addition to the revenue presentation by reportable segment, we also measure revenue performance on a geographic basis.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

Total expense and other (income) increased 2.8 percent in 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat operational spending and investments in software and systems innovation, higher interest expense, non-operating acquisition-related activity associated with the Red Hat transaction and lower IP income, partially offset by lower non-operating retirement-related costs, divesture-related activity (gains on divestitures and lower spending) and the effects of currency. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 4.1 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors above excluding the higher non-operating acquisition related activity and lower non-operating retirement-related costs described above.

For additional information regarding total expense and other (income) for both expense presentations, see the following analyses by category.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

NM–Not meaningful

Total selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense increased 6.4 percent in 2019 versus 2018, driven primarily by the following factors:

●Higher spending (5 points) driven by Red Hat spending (5 points); and

●Higher acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat acquisition (3 points); partially offset by

●The effects of currency (2 points).

Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 3.4 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors excluding the acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction.

Bad debt expense increased $22 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at December 31, 2019, an increase of 10 basis points from December 31, 2018.

Research, Development and Engineering Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

NM–Not meaningful

Research, development and engineering (RD&E) expense was 7.8 percent of revenue in 2019 and 6.8 percent of revenue in 2018.

RD&E expense increased 11.3 percent in 2019 versus 2018 primarily driven by:

●Higher spending (11 points) including investment in the z15 and Red Hat spending in the second half of 2019 (8 points); and

●Higher acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (1 point); partially offset by

●The effects of currency (1 point).

Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 10.4 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors excluding the acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction.

Intellectual Property and Custom Development Income[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees decreased 49.2 percent in 2019 compared to 2018. This was primarily due to a decline in new partnership agreements compared to the prior year. The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.

Other (Income) and Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

NM–Not meaningful

Total consolidated other (income) and expense was income of $968 million in 2019 compared to expense of $1,152 million in 2018. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:

●Lower non-operating retirement-related costs ($957 million). Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information.

●Higher gains from divestitures ($833 million) reflected in Other; and

●Higher net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) ($272 million). The company’s hedging programs help mitigate currency impacts in the Consolidated Income Statement.

Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $1,431 million of income in 2019 and increased $1,010 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by the same factors excluding lower non-operating retirement-related costs.

Interest Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

NM–Not meaningful

Interest expense increased $621 million compared to 2018. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2019 was $1,952 million, an increase of $473 million year to year, driven by a higher average debt balance and higher interest rates as we issued debt to finance the Red Hat acquisition.

Operating (non-GAAP) interest expense increased $393 million compared to the prior-year period. It excludes the Red Hat pre-closing debt financing costs.

Stock-Based Compensation

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost of $679 million increased $169 million compared to 2018. This was primarily due to increases related to the issuances and conversions of stock-based compensation for Red Hat ($150 million) and issuance of restricted stock units ($27 million). Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories: Cost: $100 million, up $18 million; SG&A expense: $453 million, up $91 million; and RD&E expense: $126 million, up $60 million.

Retirement-Related Plans

The following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans. Total operating costs/(income) are included in the Consolidated Income Statement within the caption (e.g., Cost, SG&A, RD&E) relating to the job function of the plan participants.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost decreased by $994 million compared to 2018, primarily driven by a decrease in recognized actuarial losses ($1,123 million), primarily due to the change in the amortization period in the U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan and higher expected return on plan assets ($143 million), partially offset by higher interest costs ($203 million).

Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

As discussed in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, we characterize certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2019 were $1,457 million, a decrease of $37 million compared to 2018. Non-operating costs of $615 million in 2019 decreased $957 million year to year, driven primarily by the same factors as above.

Income Taxes

The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2019 was 7.2 percent, a decrease of 15.9 points versus the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the following factors:

●A lower charge year to year of 16.5 points from the impacts of U.S. tax reform;

●A charge in 2018 from intercompany payments of 3.4 points; partially offset by

●A lower benefit year to year from audit settlements of 4.4 points.

The operating (non-GAAP) tax rate was 8.5 percent in 2019, an increase of 0.7 points versus 2018, principally driven by the same factors described above, excluding the impacts of U.S. tax reform.

For more information, see note G, “Taxes.”

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes a charge of $2.0 billion or $2.23 of basic and diluted earnings per share in 2018 associated with U.S. tax reform.

Actual shares outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018 were 887.1 million and 892.5 million, respectively. The year-to-year decrease was primarily the result of the common stock repurchase program. The average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution was 23.5 million shares lower in 2019 versus 2018.

Financial Position

Dynamics

At December 31, 2019, we continued to have the financial flexibility to support the business over the long term. Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $9,009 million. We continued to manage the investment portfolio to meet our capital preservation and liquidity objectives.

Total assets increased $28,805 million since December 31, 2018. This was primarily due to an increase in goodwill and net intangible assets of $34,104 million, driven by the Red Hat acquisition and an increase of $4,996 million in right-of-use assets recorded as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard in 2019. This was partially offset by a decline in net receivables of $7,312 million since year-end 2018 levels, primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations which we announced in February 2019.

Total debt of $62,899 million increased $17,087 million from prior year-end levels primarily to fund the Red Hat acquisition. The commercial paper balance at December 31, 2019 was $304 million, a decrease of $2,691 million from the prior year end. Within total debt, $24,727 million is in support of the Global Financing business which is leveraged at a 9 to 1 ratio. During 2019, we completed bond issuances totaling $25,712 million, with terms ranging from 2 to 30 years, and interest rates ranging from 0.375 to 4.25 percent depending on maturity. We have reduced total debt $10,140 million since the end of the second quarter of 2019. We have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continue to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and our credit facilities.

Consistent with accounting standards, the company remeasured the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans at December 31. At December 31, 2019, the overall net underfunded position was $11,090 million, an improvement of $2,043 million from December 31, 2018 driven by higher returns on assets partially offset by lower discount rates and interest costs. At year end, our qualified defined benefit plans were well funded and the required contributions related to these plans and multi-employer plans are expected to be approximately $300 million in both 2020 and 2021. In 2019, the return on the U.S. Personal Pension Plan assets was 14.9 percent and the plan was 107 percent funded at December 31, 2019. Overall, global asset returns were 13.6 percent and the qualified defined benefit plans worldwide were 102 percent funded at December 31, 2019.

During 2019, we generated $14,770 million in cash from operations, a decrease of $477 million compared to 2018. Our free cash flow for 2019 was $11,909 million, an increase of $33 million versus the prior year. See pages 58 and 59 for additional information on free cash flow. We returned $7,068 million to shareholders in 2019, with $5,707 million in dividends and $1,361 million in gross share repurchases. In 2019, we

repurchased 10.0 million shares and had $2.0 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization at year end. We suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat closing to focus on debt repayment. Our cash generation permits us to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.

Global Financing Financial Position Key Metrics[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes deferred initial direct costs which are eliminated in IBM’s consolidated results.

(2)Includes intercompany mark-up, priced on an arm’s-length basis, on products purchased from the company’s product divisions which is eliminated in IBM’s consolidated results.

(3)Entire amount eliminated for purposes of IBM’s consolidated results and therefore does not appear in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

(4)These assets, along with all other financing assets in this table, are leveraged at the value in the table using Global Financing debt.

At December 31, 2019, substantially all financing assets were IT-related assets, and approximately 62 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment-grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers, an increase of 7 points year to year. This investment-grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio.

We have a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, including credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Adjusting for the mitigation actions, the investment-grade content would increase to 67 percent, a decrease of 3 points year to year.

IBM Working Capital[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Working capital decreased $10,200 million from the year-end 2018 position. The key changes are described below:

Current assets decreased $10,726 million ($10,477 million adjusted for currency) due to:

●A decline in receivables of $6,769 million ($6,695 million adjusted for currency) driven by a decline in financing receivables of $8,197 million primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations; partially offset by an increase in other receivables of $989 million primarily related to divestitures; and

●A decrease of $3,213 million ($3,052 million adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily due to retirement of debt.

Current liabilities decreased $526 million ($449 million adjusted for currency) as a result of:

●A decrease in accounts payable of $1,662 million primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations; and

●A decrease in short-term debt of $1,410 million due to maturities of $12,649 million and a decrease in commercial paper of $2,691 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $7,592 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities and issuances of $6,334 million; offset by

●An increase in operating lease liabilities of $1,380 million as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019; and

●An increase in deferred income of $861 million ($890 million adjusted for currency).

Global Financing Receivables and Allowances

The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding residual values, the allowance for credit losses and immaterial miscellaneous receivables:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes deferred initial direct costs which are eliminated in IBM’s consolidated results.

The percentage of Global Financing receivables reserved was 1.0 percent at December 31, 2019, compared to 0.9 percent at December 31, 2018. The decline in the allowance for credit losses was driven by write-offs of $64 million, primarily of receivables previously reserved, and net releases of $7 million as a result of lower average asset balances in client and commercial financing. See note K, “Financing Receivables,” for additional information.

* Additions for Allowance for Credit Losses are charged to expense.

** Refer to note A, “Significant Accounting Policies,” for additional information regarding Allowance for Credit Loss write-offs.

+ Primarily represents translation adjustments.

Global Financing’s bad debt expense was a release of $7 million in 2019, compared to an addition of $14 million in 2018, due to lower specific reserves and a higher unallocated reserve release in 2019.

Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The increase in noncurrent assets of $39,531 million ($39,470 million adjusted for currency) was driven by:

●A net increase in goodwill and net intangible assets of $34,104 million ($34,058 million adjusted for currency) due to the acquisition of Red Hat; and

●An increase in operating right-of-use assets of $4,996 million ($5,010 million adjusted for currency) as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019; and

●An increase in prepaid pension assets of $2,199 million ($2,152 million adjusted for currency) driven by higher returns on plan assets and plan remeasurements; partially offset by

●A decrease in net property, plant and equipment of $782 million ($785 million adjusted for currency).

Long-term debt increased $18,497 million ($18,550 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by:

●Issuances of $26,081 million; partially offset by

●Reclassifications to short-term debt of $7,592 million to reflect upcoming maturities.

Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased $6,778 million ($6,911 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by:

●An increase in long-term operating lease liabilities of $3,879 million ($3,893 million adjusted for currency) as a result of the adoption of the new leasing standard on January 1, 2019; and

●An increase in other liabilities of $2,352 million ($2,320 million adjusted for currency), primarily driven by increases in deferred tax liabilities of $1,534 million and income tax reserves of $923 million.

Debt

Our funding requirements are continually monitored and we execute our strategies to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, we maintain sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Total debt of $62,899 million increased $17,087 million from December 31, 2018, driven by issuances of $32,415 million; partially offset by debt maturities of $12,673 million and a decrease in commercial paper of $2,691 million.

Non-Global Financing debt of $38,173 million increased $23,587 million from prior year-end levels primarily driven by issuances to fund the Red Hat acquisition.

Global Financing debt of $24,727 million decreased $6,500 million from December 31, 2018, primarily due to the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations.

Global Financing provides financing predominantly for IBM’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for GTS, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these GTS assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.

The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing. The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9 to 1 at December 31, 2019.

As previously stated, we measure Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note D, “Segments.” In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to IBM is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.

Equity

Total equity increased by $4,055 million from December 31, 2018 as a result of net income of $9,431 million, a decline in accumulated other comprehensive losses of $893 million primarily due to retirement-related benefits plans, and an increase in common stock of $745 million; partially offset by decreases from dividends of $5,707 million, and an increase in treasury stock of $1,342 million mainly due to share repurchases.

Cash Flow

Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 71 are summarized in the table below. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $477 million in 2019 driven by the following key factors:

●An increase in cash income tax payments of $346 million;

●An increase in interest payments on debt of approximately $300 million, driven by incremental debt used to fund the acquisition of Red Hat; and

●Performance-related declines within net income, including lower operating cash flows due to businesses divested in 2019; partially offset by

●An increase of $836 million in cash provided by financing receivables.

Net cash used in investing activities increased $22,023 million driven by:

●An increase in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,491 million, primarily driven by the acquisition of Red Hat; offset by

●An increase of $7,223 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations;

●A decrease in cash used for net capital expenditures of $1,346 million; and

●An increase in cash provided by divestitures of $1,076 million.

Financing activities were a net source of cash of $9,042 million in 2019 compared to a net use of cash of $10,469 million in 2018. The year-to-year increase in cash flow of $19,512 million was driven by:

●An increase in net cash sourced from debt transactions of $16,584 million primarily driven by net issuances to fund the Red Hat acquisition; and

●A decrease in cash used for gross common share repurchases of $3,082 million.

Snapshot

In the fourth quarter of 2019, we reported $21.8 billion in revenue, $3.7 billion in income from continuing operations and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $4.2 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.11 as reported and $4.71 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We also generated $3.5 billion in cash from operations, $6.0 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $1.4 billion in dividends. We had solid transactional performance across our high-value software and systems. In addition, benefits from the synergies of IBM and Red Hat drove growth in our services to migrate, build and manage hybrid cloud environments. Overall, performance resulted in revenue growth, margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation in the quarter.

Total consolidated revenue increased 0.1 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Excluding divested businesses, revenue was up 2.2 percent as reported and 3 percent adjusted for currency. Cloud & Cognitive Software increased 8.7 percent as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency with growth across all three lines of business. Cloud & Data Platforms, which includes Red Hat, grew 19.0 percent (20 percent adjusted for currency), Cognitive Applications grew 0.6 percent (1 percent adjusted for currency) and Transaction Processing Platforms increased 2.9 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency). GBS decreased 0.6 percent as reported and was flat adjusted for currency. There was continued growth in Consulting which grew 3.5 percent (4 percent adjusted for currency) driven by services that enable each phase of our clients’ digital journeys. GTS decreased 4.8 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency, with declines in Infrastructure & Cloud Services and Technology Support Services. While there was continued year-to-year growth in our cloud offerings within GTS, there were declines in client-based volumes, in some of the more traditional labor-based managed services. Systems increased 16.0 percent as reported and 16 percent adjusted for currency with growth in IBM Z and Storage Systems, partially offset by a decline in Power Systems. IBM Z had strong growth of 62.3 percent (63 percent adjusted for currency) in the first full quarter of z15 shipments. Storage Systems increased 2.8 percent (3 percent adjusted for currency) year to year led by growth in the high end, while Power Systems declined 23.7 percent (23 percent adjusted for currency) compared with strong performance in the prior year. Across the segments, total IBM cloud revenue of $6.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019 grew 21 percent as reported and adjusted for currency.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue increased 2.3 percent year to year as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) and 6 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency. EMEA increased 0.1 percent (2 percent adjusted for currency) and 4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency. Asia Pacific declined 5.2 percent year to year as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) and 6 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency.

The consolidated gross margin of 51.0 percent increased 1.9 points year to year reflecting contribution from our high-value software and systems, partially offset by impacts related to Red Hat (deferred revenue adjustment and amortization of intangibles). The operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 51.8 percent increased 2.3 points versus the prior year, primarily driven by the same factors, excluding the amortization of intangibles.

Total expense and other (income) increased 13.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus the prior year primarily driven by higher spending including Red Hat operational spending, higher interest expense from debt issuances to fund the acquisition, continued investment in innovation and go-to-market capabilities, higher acquisition-related charges and higher amortization of acquired intangibles. These increases were partially offset by divestiture-related gains and lower non-operating retirement-related costs. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 14.7 percent year to year, driven primarily by the higher spending and investment, partially offset by the divestiture-related gains described above.

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $4.0 billion, decreased 10.0 percent and the pre-tax margin was 18.3 percent, a decrease of 2.0 points versus the prior-year period reflecting the purchase accounting deferred revenue adjustment for Red Hat (lower revenue without an equivalent adjustment to cost and expense) and acquisition-related activity. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 8.1 percent and net income from continuing operations was $3.7 billion. This is compared with net income from continuing operations of $2.0 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018, which included a $1.9 billion charge for tax reform. Our net income margin from continuing operations was 16.8 percent, an increase of 7.9 points year to year.

Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $4.7 billion decreased 6.6 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 1.5 points to 21.6 percent. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 10.5 percent versus 12.2 percent in the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $4.2 billion decreased 4.8 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 19.3 percent, down 1.0 points year to year.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $4.11 in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 91.2 percent, primarily due to the prior-year tax reform charge. Operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $4.71 decreased 3.3 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2018.

Cloud & Cognitive Software

Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue of $7,238 million grew 8.7 percent as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. We had growth as reported and adjusted for currency in all three lines of business: Cognitive Applications, Cloud & Data Platforms and Transaction Processing Platforms. Growth in Cloud & Data Platforms and total cloud revenue in the segment reflected the acquisition of Red Hat and clients’ continued adoption of our hybrid cloud solutions.

In the fourth quarter, Cognitive Applications revenue of $1,619 million increased 0.6 percent as reported and 1 percent adjusted for currency, reflecting the strength of our AI-led software solutions including Security and IoT. We continue to drive new innovations in these areas, and in November 2019, we launched Cloud Pak for Security which allows clients to leverage their investments in cybersecurity by integrating their security tools with existing data sources to more quickly resolve security incidents. In IoT, we extended our Maximo suite of offerings with the announcement of Maximo Asset Monitor, an AI-powered monitoring solution designed to help clients better maintain and improve performance of their high-value physical assets.

Cloud & Data Platforms revenue of $3,101 million increased 19.0 percent as reported and 20 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year reflecting the acquisition of Red Hat in 2019. Demand for our cloud capabilities continued to ramp and we began to realize synergies across IBM and Red Hat. We had strong performance in the quarter in Red Hat’s RHEL and OpenShift, and broad-based traction across the suite of Cloud Paks that addresses workloads across automation, data and integration. Clients are realizing the benefits of hybrid cloud with our containerized middleware and data platform software portfolio, including faster deployment and improved automation.

Cloud & Cognitive Software gross profit margin of 79.2 percent decreased 0.2 points during the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $2,901 million decreased 7.1 percent compared to the prior year and pre-tax margin decreased 6.0 points to 36.6 percent, driven primarily by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition.

Global Business Services

GBS revenue of $4,243 million decreased 0.6 percent as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. We had growth in Consulting, offset by declines in Application Management and Global Process Services. We have been investing in offerings and capabilities to help advise our clients and move their applications to a hybrid multi-cloud environment.

Consulting revenue of $2,078 million increased 3.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). The growth in Consulting was driven by services that enable each phase of our clients’ digital journey. We had continued growth in application modernization and development, next-generation enterprise applications such as S/4 Hana and Salesforce, and in offerings that use AI to help clients unlock opportunities and realize productivity improvements.

Application Management revenue of $1,922 million decreased 3.3 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). We had continued growth across our offerings that build and manage cloud applications, offset by declines in traditional enterprise application management. This was primarily driven by strong performance in the fourth-quarter 2018 as a result of significant milestone achievements across a few accounts.

Global Process Services revenue of $243 million decreased 10.8 percent as reported (10 percent adjusted for currency), as demand shifted from traditional Business Process Optimization offerings to our new business platforms around intelligent workflows.

Within GBS, cloud revenue of $1.5 billion grew 3 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.

GBS fourth-quarter gross profit margin of 27.5 percent decreased 0.3 points year to year. Pre-tax income of $478 million decreased 15.6 percent year to year. The pre-tax margin decreased 1.9 points to 11.1 percent. In the quarter, we had margin contribution from the yield on our contract delivery improvements, a mix shift to higher-value content and a currency benefit from leveraging our global delivery resource footprint. These benefits were offset by investments we made in capacity and offerings to capture market opportunity.

Global Technology Services

GTS revenue of $6,949 million decreased 4.8 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency), primarily due to lower client business volumes which impacted some of the more traditional labor-based managed services. We continued to have solid growth in our cloud offerings as clients turn to IBM to enable their transition to cloud. GTS’ knowledge of our clients’ industries, business and regulatory requirements is a differentiator as clients accelerate their shift of mission-critical workloads to the cloud.

Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue of $5,282 million declined 5.3 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency). Revenue was impacted by lower client business volumes. We are taking actions to accelerate the shift to higher-value segments of the market opportunity, such as introducing new managed services offerings for public and private cloud in the areas of cybersecurity, data management and hybrid orchestration. We are also expanding our cloud data center footprint and deploying a more asset-based delivery model.

Technology Support Services revenue of $1,667 million decreased 3.2 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) primarily due to hardware product cycle dynamics. 

Within GTS, cloud revenue of $2.4 billion grew 12 percent year to year as reported (13 percent adjusted for currency).

GTS gross profit margin of 35.2 percent expanded 0.2 points in the fourth-quarter 2019 compared to the prior-year period. This improvement was driven by our continued scale-out of our public cloud, a mix within the portfolio and productivity actions. Pre-tax income of $645 million decreased 1.7 percent and the pre-tax margin increased 0.3 points to 8.9 percent year to year, reflecting a significant sequential improvement in pre-tax margin.

Systems

Systems revenue of $3,042 million grew 16.0 percent year to year as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2019. Systems Hardware revenue of $2,560 million increased 17.7 percent as reported (18 percent adjusted for currency). This growth was driven primarily by IBM Z and Storage Systems, partially offset by a decline in Power Systems. The strong performance in IBM Z reflects our first full quarter of shipments of the new z15 mainframe. Storage Systems growth was led by the high-end systems, which includes the next generation high-end storage system DS8900 that is tightly integrated with the z15 mainframe.

Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue grew 62.3 percent as reported (63 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, reflecting the broad adoption of the new z15 mainframe across many industries and countries, and demonstrates our clients’ demand for technology that addresses data privacy and resiliency, across hybrid cloud. We shipped the highest volume of MIPs in the program’s history in the fourth-quarter 2019, driven by growth in new workloads, and in October 2019, we announced Red Hat OpenShift for IBM Z, integrating the industry’s most comprehensive enterprise container and Kubernetes platform with the enterprise server platforms of IBM Z and LinuxONE.

Within Systems, cloud revenue of $1.4 billion increased 21 percent year to year as reported and adjusted for currency.

The Systems gross profit margin increased 5.2 points to 56.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $802 million increased 45.6 percent and pre-tax margin increased 5.5 points year to year to 24.8 percent. The Systems profit and margin expansion reflects the benefits from the new z15 mainframe and DS8900 high-end storage system launched in 2019.

Global Financing

Global Financing revenue of $301 million decreased 25.3 percent year to year, which reflects the company’s wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations. Global Financing fourth-quarter pre-tax income decreased 20.9 percent to $252 million and the pre-tax margin of 38.9 percent decreased 2.4 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was driven by a decrease in gross profit, partially offset by a decrease in SG&A expense.

Cash Flow

We generated $3.5 billion in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to higher interest and income tax payments. Net cash sourced from investing activities of $0.1 billion was $0.3 billion lower than the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in cash from net proceeds from disposition of marketable securities and other investments ($2.2 billion), partially offset by an increase in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($1.5 billion) and lower net capital expenditures ($0.2 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $5.7 billion increased $1.1 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower debt issuances ($3.0 billion), partially offset by lower gross common stock repurchases ($2.0 billion).

Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue increased in 2018 compared to the prior year with growth in all three lines of business, as reported and adjusted for currency. Within Cognitive Applications, the increase was driven by strong double-digit growth in security services, while growth in Cloud & Data Platforms was led by analytics platforms and integration offerings. Transaction Processing Platforms grew with improved revenue performance sequentially in the fourth quarter 2018 versus the third-quarter 2018 reflecting clients’ commitment to the company’s platform for the long-term and the value it provides in managing mission-critical workloads. Within Cloud & Cognitive Software, cloud revenue of $3.0 billion grew 10 percent as reported and adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Gross margin in Cloud & Cognitive Software was impacted by an increased mix toward SaaS, a mix toward security services and increased royalty costs associated with IP licensing agreements compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income improvement year to year was primarily driven by operational efficiencies and mix.

Global Business Services[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Global Business Services revenue increased compared to 2017 driven by strong growth in Consulting, led by key offerings in digital and cloud application, where the business has brought together technology and industry expertise to help clients on their digital journey. GPS grew year to year, while Application Management revenue was flat as reported and declined adjusted for currency compared to 2017. While we continued to help clients move to the cloud with offerings such as Cloud Migration Factory and cloud application development, there were continued declines in the more traditional application management engagements. Within GBS, cloud revenue of $4.7 billion grew 20 percent as reported and 19 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The year-to-year improvements in margins and pre-tax income in GBS were the result of the shift to higher-value offerings, realignment of resources to key skill areas, increased productivity and utilization as well as a benefit from currency, due to the company’s global delivery model.

Global Technology Services[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

Global Technology Services revenue decreased 0.2 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) in 2018 compared to the prior year, with Infrastructure & Cloud Services up 0.8 percent as reported (flat adjusted for currency) offset by a decline in Technology Support Services. In Infrastructure & Cloud Services, the business focused on prioritizing the portfolio to deliver high-value solutions to bring productivity to clients and allow for expanding workloads, while it exited some lower-value offerings. Technology Support Services was impacted by the hardware product cycle dynamics in 2018 but grew its multi-vendor services offerings. Within GTS, cloud revenue of $8.0 billion grew 22 percent as reported and 21 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The 2018 GTS gross profit margin was essentially flat year to year and reflected benefits from productivity initiatives, including automation of delivery processes infused with AI and global workforce optimization. Pre-tax income performance reflected continued investment to expand go-to-market capabilities and develop new offerings for the hybrid market.

Systems revenue of $8,034 million decreased 2.0 percent year to year as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) driven by strong IBM Z performance in 2017 and continued price pressures impacting Storage Systems in a competitive environment. Both hardware platforms were down year to year for the full year, as reported and adjusted for currency. This performance was partially offset by strong growth in Power Systems (which grew as reported and adjusted for currency in 2018) with strong performance in Power9-based systems and Linux throughout the year. Within Systems, cloud revenue of $3.1 billion decreased 10 percent as reported and adjusted for currency compared to the prior year reflecting IBM Z product cycle dynamics.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The Systems gross profit margin decrease year to year was driven by the mix away from IBM Z and margin declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems. The pre-tax income decline was driven by the strong performance in IBM Z in the prior year and the continued investment in innovation across the Systems portfolio.

Global Financing[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The increase in Global Financing total revenue was driven by an increase in internal revenue, partially offset by a decrease in external revenue. Internal revenue grew 9.5 percent driven by increases in internal financing (up 17.6 percent) and internal used equipment sales (up 6.8 percent). External revenue declined 6.3 percent due to a decrease in external used equipment sales (down 30.8 percent), partially offset by an increase in external financing (up 4.9 percent). The increase in Global Financing pre-tax income was primarily driven by an increase in gross profit and a decrease in total expense.

Looking Forward

IBM is focused on chapter 2 of clients’ digital reinventions, which includes scaling AI and shifting mission-critical workloads to the cloud. To address the cloud opportunity, enterprises need to be able to move and manage data, services and workflows across multiple clouds and on-premises. They also need to be able to address security concerns, data protection and protocols, availability and cloud management. This is best addressed with a hybrid, multi-cloud, open approach, based on a foundation of Linux, with containers and Kubernetes. On July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat, which significantly changed the cloud landscape and will accelerate our high value business model. Together, IBM and Red Hat offer the leading hybrid, multi-cloud platform built on open source technologies.

The combination of IBM and Red Hat is already off to a strong start. In August, we introduced Cloud Paks, cloud-native software that brings together IBM middleware, AI, management and security and Red Hat’s OpenShift platform. As we look forward, the largest hybrid cloud opportunity is in services: advising clients on architectural choices, moving workloads, building new applications and managing those applications. With GBS and GTS expertise in digital reinventions and managing mission-critical workloads, we are well positioned to help our

clients on this journey. We brought additional new innovations to the market in 2019 including: the financial services public cloud, z15 and high-end storage and we have a leadership position in quantum computing. With these innovations, we built momentum for growth in 2020.

At the time of our fourth quarter earnings report, analysts’ estimates of our revenue growth were approximately 3 percent for 2020, which we stated was reasonable. This includes about a 1 point impact from businesses divested in 2019, and January 17, 2020 expectations for currency translation. This also includes an expectation of an improving trend in GTS, predominantly in the second half of 2020. We also expect to expand GAAP and operating (non-GAAP) gross margins and pre-tax income will include impacts from significant structural actions in 2020, primarily in our GTS business as we shift toward a more asset-based model to create a more competitive, flexible structure.

At constant currency, we expect accelerated growth of about 0.5 points from the fourth-quarter 2019 revenue growth rates to first-quarter 2020. At January 17, 2020 spot rates, we expect currency to be a headwind to first-quarter revenue growth of about 1.0 to 1.5 points, as compared to a headwind of 0.6 points in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Consistent with the acquisition of a highly profitable software business, non-cash purchase accounting adjustments resulted in the Red Hat acquisition being dilutive to full-year 2019 earnings per share. In an acquisition, U.S. GAAP requires a company to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair value. This includes the acquired deferred revenue balance. This resulted in a non-cash adjustment of $2.2 billion to the acquired deferred revenue balance and resulted in a reduction to reported revenue post-closing. The level of adjustment reflects the high margin profile of Red Hat’s subscription-based business. While there will be continued impact in 2020 from the deferred revenue adjustment from the Red Hat purchase accounting, it will largely be in the first half and lessen throughout the year.

Overall, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations for 2020 to be at least $10.57. Excluding acquisition-related charges of $1.70 per share, non-operating retirement-related items of $1.02 per share and tax reform enactment impacts of $0.06 per share, operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share is expected to be at least $13.35. For the first quarter of 2020, we expect GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations to be 12 to 13 percent of the full-year expectation and operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share to be approximately 14 to 15 percent of the respective full-year expectation. This reflects typical seasonality of IBM’s operations, and the impact of the Red Hat deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment.

We expect free cash flow to be approximately $12.5 billion in 2020. This includes contribution from Red Hat combined with incremental software and services synergy profits and net of incremental interest to finance the transaction and other acquisition-related charges. Free cash flow expectations reflect expected operational profit performance, partially offset by headwinds in capital expenditures and cash tax.

For full-year 2020, we expect the GAAP effective tax rate to be approximately 3 to 6 percent, including an estimate for potential discrete tax events (discretes). We expect the operating (non-GAAP) tax rate for 2020 to be approximately 7 to 9 percent, including an estimate of potential discretes. We expect a discrete tax benefit in the first quarter of 2020. Together with the expected structural actions described above, we anticipate that these two items will be approximately neutral to the first quarter and full-year 2020 earnings per share. Discretes by their nature are difficult to estimate and the actual impacts will be recorded as the discrete events occur. The rates will change year to year based on discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies. The GAAP effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, audit adjustments, among others.

The Red Hat acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and debt, with the incremental debt issued in the first half of 2019. We will continue with a disciplined financial policy and are committed to maintaining strong investment grade credit ratings. Since the end of the second quarter of 2019, we reduced our debt balance by $10.1 billion. We are continuing to target a leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple years, while maintaining our solid and growing dividend. We suspended our share repurchase program at the close of the acquisition to direct our free cash flow towards reducing debt levels. The combination of these actions provides us with the flexibility to invest in the business going forward.

Beginning in the second quarter of 2019 and continuing throughout the year, IBM’s Global Financing business wound down the portion of its commercial financing operations which provides short-term working capital solutions for OEM information technology suppliers, distributors and resellers. This was consistent with our capital allocation strategy and high-value focus. IBM Global Financing will continue to provide differentiated end-to-end financing solutions, including commercial financing in support of IBM partner relationships.

We expect 2020 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.7 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2019. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2019. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, an increase of approximately $600 million compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2020, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2019.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $14.8 billion and $16.7 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to

​

global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2017 through 2019.

Cash Flow and Liquidity Trends[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

On July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. In the second half of 2019, we reduced debt levels by $10.1 billion. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.

The indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.

We are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.

We do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2019, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $673 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

The major ratings agencies ratings on our debt securities at December 31, 2019 were as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

After closing the Red Hat transaction, Moody’s, as expected, downgraded IBM and IBM Credit LLC’s long-term debt rating from A1 to A2 and improved its outlook to stable. We deleveraged during the second half of 2019 and remain committed to a target leverage profile consistent with a mid to high single A credit rating within a couple of years.

In July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are evaluating the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate.

We prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page 45. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.

Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and increasing receivables is the basis for growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.

From the perspective of how management views cash flow, in 2019, after investing $2.4 billion in capital investments primarily in support of the services and cloud-based businesses, we generated free cash flow of $11.9 billion which was essentially flat compared to 2018. Year to year, there were lower capital expenditures, offset by higher cash income tax and interest payments and lower operating cash flows from businesses divested in 2019. In 2019, we continued to return value to shareholders including $5.7 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in gross common stock repurchases.

Over the past three years, we generated over $36 billion in free cash flow. During that period, we invested over $33 billion in strategic acquisitions and returned over $27 billion to shareholders through dividends and gross share repurchases. The amount of prospective returns to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases will vary based upon several factors including each year’s operating results, capital expenditure requirements, research and development investments and acquisitions, as well as the factors discussed below. In order to continue to deleverage, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of closing the Red Hat acquisition.

IBM’s Board of Directors considers the dividend payment on a quarterly basis. In the second quarter of 2019, the Board of Directors increased the company’s quarterly common stock dividend from $1.57 to $1.62 per share.

The table below represents the way in which management reviews cash flow as described above.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* 111% in 2018 excluding charges of $2.0 billion and 116% in 2017 excluding the charge of $5.5 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform.

Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note R, “Commitments & Contingencies.” With respect to pension funding, in 2019, we contributed $274 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans compared to $363 million in 2018. As highlighted in the Contractual Obligations table, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1.5 billion in the next five years. The 2020 contributions are currently expected to be approximately $300 million. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2020, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2019. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.

In 2020, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

Our cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities.

Contractual Obligations[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Finance lease obligations are presented on a discounted cash flow basis, whereas operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted cash flow basis.

** As funded status on plans will vary, obligations for mandated minimum pension payments after 2024 could not be reasonably estimated.

+ These amounts represent the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that approximately $236 million of the liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. The settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the income tax liability cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing of the payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities; however, it is not expected to be due within the next 12 months.

Certain contractual obligations reported in the previous table exclude the effects of time value and therefore, may not equal the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the previous table as their future cash outflows are uncertain. This includes deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred income, disability benefits and other sundry items. Certain obligations related to our divestitures are included.

Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services (take-or-pay). If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the previous table. If the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation. Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that specify that we will purchase all or a portion of our requirements of a specific product, commodity or service from a supplier or vendor. These contracts are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms. They do not specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and, therefore, we do not consider them to be purchase obligations.

Interest on floating-rate debt obligations is calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2019, plus the interest rate spread associated with that debt, if any.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

From time to time, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67), “Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.”

At December 31, 2019, we had no such off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See the table above for our contractual obligations, and note R, “Commitments & Contingencies,” for detailed information about our guarantees, financial commitments and indemnification arrangements. We do not have retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or other material off-balance sheet interests or instruments.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The application of GAAP requires IBM to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to IBM’s financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of IBM’s Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies are described in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.”

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to

​

Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

assess sensitivity (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, etc.) are included to allow users of the Annual Report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

Pension Assumptions

For our defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of the benefit obligation to plan participants and net periodic pension (income)/cost requires the use of certain assumptions, including, among others, estimates of discount rates and expected return on plan assets.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the (gain)/loss amortization and interest cost components of the net periodic pension (income)/cost calculation and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The discount rate assumption for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (PPP), a U.S.-based defined benefit plan, decreased by 100 basis points to 3.10 percent on December 31, 2019. This change will increase pre-tax income recognized in 2020 by an estimated $31 million. If the discount rate assumption for the PPP had increased by 100 basis points on December 31, 2019, pre-tax income recognized in 2020 would decrease by an estimated $16 million. Further changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact our funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the PPP’s PBO of an estimated $1.2 billion based upon December 31, 2019 data.

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is used in calculating the net periodic pension (income)/cost. Expected returns on plan assets are calculated based on the market-related value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized over five years in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost and also as a component of actuarial (gains)/losses, which are recognized over the service lives or life expectancy of the participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed thresholds which are based upon the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets, as provided by accounting standards.

To the extent the outlook for long-term returns changes such that management changes its expected long-term return on plan assets assumption, each 50 basis point increase or decrease in the expected long-term return on PPP plan assets assumption would have an estimated decrease or increase, respectively, of $241 million on the following year’s pre-tax net periodic pension (income)/cost (based upon the PPP’s plan assets at December 31, 2019 and assuming no contributions are made in 2020).

We may voluntarily make contributions or be required, by law, to make contributions to our pension plans. Actual results that differ from the estimates may result in more or less future IBM funding into the pension plans than is planned by management. Impacts of these types of changes on our pension plans in other countries worldwide would vary depending upon the status of each respective plan.

In addition to the above, we evaluate other pension assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age and mortality, and update these assumptions to reflect experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year can differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.

For additional information on our pension plans and the development of these assumptions, see note V, “Retirement-Related Benefits.”

Revenue Recognition

Application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance obligations. Other significant judgments include determining whether IBM or a reseller is acting as the principal in a transaction and whether separate contracts should be combined and considered part of one arrangement.

Revenue recognition is also impacted by our ability to determine when a contract is probable of collection and to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties, and performance bonuses. We consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. If the estimates were changed by 10 percent in 2019, the impact on net income would have been immaterial.

Costs to Complete Service Contracts

We enter into numerous service contracts through our services businesses. During the contractual period, revenue, cost and profits may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate profitability of each contract, especially contracts for which we use cost-to-cost measures of progress. If at any time these estimates indicate the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost. We perform ongoing profitability analyses of these services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. Contract loss provisions recorded as a component of other accrued expenses and liabilities were immaterial at December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes.

During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are

adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that new information becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies/actions. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

The consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.

To the extent that the provision for income taxes increases/decreases by 1 percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes, consolidated net income would have decreased/improved by $102 million in 2019.

Valuation of Assets

The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired including separately identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

Valuation of Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. In 2019, we assessed the qualitative risk factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.

We assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units that carry goodwill including relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of reporting units. Examples include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, as well as other individual factors such as:

●A loss of key personnel;

●A significant adverse shift in the operating environment of the reporting unit such as unanticipated competition;

●A significant pending litigation;

●A more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; and

●An adverse action or assessment by a regulator.

We assess these qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Given our segment changes and the significant acquisition of Red Hat, we performed the quantitative Step 1 tests of goodwill impairment for all affected reporting units in 2019. After performing the annual goodwill impairment qualitative analysis during the fourth quarter of 2019, only the Systems reporting unit required quantitative review as a result of the qualitative analysis. The qualitative assessment indicated a potential impairment triggering event as a result of the financial performance of the Systems reporting unit. The quantitative analysis resulted in no impairment as the estimated fair value of the Systems reporting unit, which had goodwill of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2019, exceeded its carrying amount by approximately 30 percent.

Our quantitative impairment testing did not indicate any goodwill impairment, and all of the other reporting units with goodwill had a fair value that was substantially in excess of its carrying value.

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation, and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Global Financing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses

The Global Financing business reviews its financing receivables portfolio on a regular basis in order to assess collectibility and records adjustments to the allowance for credit losses at least quarterly. A description of the methods used by management to estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.” Factors that could result in actual receivable losses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the economic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in Global Financing’s receivables portfolio.

​

To the extent that actual collectibility differs from management’s estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, Global Financing’s segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated $22 million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates.

Residual Value

Residual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates can impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Global Financing estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are periodically reviewed and “other than temporary” declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification. Anticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed.

Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment.

To the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than management’s estimates by 10 percent, Global Financing’s segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2019 would have been lower by an estimated $73 million. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than management’s estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end of lease when the equipment is remarketed.

Currency Rate Fluctuations

Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. At December 31, 2019, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2018. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.

During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, we may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve our position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to our customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, we believe that some of the currency-based changes in cost impact the prices charged to clients. We also maintain currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which may temporarily mitigate, but not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results.

We translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted our year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in 2019. Based on the currency rate movements in 2019, total revenue decreased 3.1 percent as reported and 1.0 percent at constant currency versus 2018. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $300 million in 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $260 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $300 million in 2018, on both an as-reported basis and operating (non-GAAP) basis. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but we believe it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.

For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.

During 2018, the three-year cumulative inflation rates in Argentina, using a combination of monthly indices, exceeded the 100 percent threshold for hyperinflation. As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina with no material impact. In 2019, the Argentinean economy continued to experience high inflation. The ongoing impact is not material given the size of the company’s operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2019 and 2018 revenue, respectively).

Market Risk

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. In addition to the market risk associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of risk include collectibility of accounts receivable and recoverability of residual values on leased assets.

We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from these risks.

Our debt, in support of the Global Financing business and the geographic breadth of our operations, contains an element of market risk from changes in interest and currency rates. We manage this risk, in part, through the use of a variety of financial instruments including derivatives, as described in note T, “Derivative Financial Instruments.”

To meet disclosure requirements, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and other financial instruments.

The financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis are comprised of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term and long-term loans, commercial financing and installment payment receivables, investments, long-term and short-term debt and derivative financial instruments. Our

derivative financial instruments generally include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward contracts.

To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market-sensitive instruments. The market values for interest and foreign currency exchange risk are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in rates that are attributable to the market risk being measured. The discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The differences in this comparison are the hypothetical gains or losses associated with each type of risk.

Information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because, due to practical limitations, all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant. In addition, the results of the model are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically excluded from the analysis, while the financial instruments relating to the financing or hedging of those items are included by definition. Excluded items include short-term and long-term receivables from sales-type and direct financing leases, forecasted foreign currency cash flows and the company’s net investment in foreign operations. As a consequence, reported changes in the values of some of the financial instruments impacting the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge.

The results of the sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2019 and 2018, are as follows:

Interest Rate Risk

A 10 percent decrease in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of $563 million and $422 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. A 10 percent increase in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of $546 million and $408 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

At December 31, 2019, a 10 percent weaker U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of $616 million as compared to an increase of $697 million at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, a 10 percent stronger U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, with all other variables held constant, would result in an increase in the fair value of our financial instruments of $616 million as compared to a decrease of $697 million at December 31, 2018.

Financing Risks

See the “Description of Business” on page 33 for a discussion of the financing risks associated with the Global Financing business and management’s actions to mitigate such risks.

Cybersecurity

While cybersecurity risk can never be completely eliminated, our approach draws on the depth and breadth of our global capabilities, both in terms of our offerings to clients and our internal approaches to risk management. We offer commercial security solutions that deliver capabilities in areas such as identity and access management, data security, application security, network security and endpoint security. These solutions include pervasive encryption, threat intelligence, analytics, cognitive and artificial intelligence, and forensic capabilities that analyze client security events, yielding insights about attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities facing the client. We also offer professional consulting and technical services solutions for security from assessment and incident response to deployment and resource augmentation. In addition, we offer managed and outsourced security solutions from multiple security operations centers around the world. Finally, security is embedded in a multitude of our products and offerings through secure engineering and operations, and by critical functions (e.g., encryption, access control) in servers, storage, software, services, and other solutions.

From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk-management approach based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to identify and address cybersecurity risks. In addition, we have established policies and procedures that provide the foundation upon which IBM’s infrastructure and data are managed. We regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against cybersecurity attacks and threats on networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data and cloud solutions. We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to mitigate cybersecurity risks. We also have threat intelligence and security monitoring programs, as well as a global incident response process to respond to cybersecurity threats and attacks. In addition, we utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce.

Management Responsibility for Financial Information

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. An important element of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program. Our system also contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

To assure the effective administration of internal controls, we carefully select and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and procedures, provide appropriate communication channels and foster an environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of independent, non-management directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent registered public accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder ratification. The Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, with the company’s internal auditors, as well as with IBM management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and financial reporting matters.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit IBM’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Its accompanying report is based on audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).
