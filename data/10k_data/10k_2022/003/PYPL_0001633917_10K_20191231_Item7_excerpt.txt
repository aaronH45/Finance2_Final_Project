Business Environment 

We are a leading technology platform and digital payments company that enables digital and mobile payments on behalf of consumers and merchants worldwide. PayPal is committed to democratizing financial services and empowering people and businesses to join and thrive in the global economy. Our goal is to enable our consumers and merchants to manage and move their money anywhere in the world, anytime, on any platform, and using any device. We also facilitate person-to-person (“P2P”) payments through our PayPal, Venmo, and Xoom products. Our combined payment solutions, including our PayPal, PayPal Credit, Braintree, Venmo, Xoom, and iZettle products, comprise our proprietary Payments Platform.

We operate globally and in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on important issues such as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity, and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including the way laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, we monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.

Information security risks for global payments and technology companies like us have significantly increased in recent years. We are not immune to these risks and there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. For additional information regarding our information security risks, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could result in serious harm to our reputation, business, and financial condition.”

The United Kingdom (“U.K.”) held a referendum in June 2016 in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the European Union (“EU”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K. formally exited the EU on January 31, 2020 and a transition period is in place until December 31, 2020 during which time the U.K. will remain in both the EU customs union and single market and follow EU rules. There is a significant lack of clarity over the terms of the U.K.’s future relationship with the EU after that date. We are currently unable to determine the impact that Brexit will have on our business, as any impact will depend, in part, on the outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory, and other negotiations. For additional information on how Brexit could affect our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU could adversely affect us.” 

40
Brexit could adversely affect U.K., regional (including European), and worldwide economic and market conditions, and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign currency exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the British Pound and Euro. We have foreign currency exchange exposure management programs designed to help reduce the impact from foreign currency exchange rate movements. 

In 2019, 2018, and 2017, net revenues generated from our U.K. operations constituted 11% of total net revenues. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, net revenues generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.) constituted less than 20% of total net revenues. Approximately 37% and 31% of our gross loans and interest receivables as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were generated from our U.K. operations. Approximately 6% and 7% of our gross loans and interest receivables as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were generated from the EU (excluding the U.K.). 

Overview of Results of Operations

The following table provides a summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million, except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.

** Not Meaningful

Net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 15%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, driven primarily by growth in TPV (as defined below under “Net Revenues”) of 23%. Net revenues from our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate in 2019. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in interest and fee income due to the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Bank (“Synchrony”) in July 2018, which resulted in a negative impact of approximately four percentage points to the net revenues growth rate in 2019.

Total operating expenses increased $1.8 billion, or 14%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, due primarily to an increase in transaction expense, and to a lesser extent, technology and development, customer support and operations, and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decline in restructuring and other charges. Operating expenses related to our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate in total operating expenses in 2019.

Operating income increased $525 million, or 24%, in 2019 as compared to 2018. Acquisitions completed in 2018 had a negative impact of approximately five percentage points to the 2019 growth rate in operating income. Our operating margin was 15% and 14% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Operating margin in 2019 was positively impacted by a reduction in restructuring and other charges driven primarily by the completion of the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018, subsequent to which we no longer record adjustments to the cost basis of loans and interest receivables held for sale, offset by a negative impact of growth in our transaction expense, which increased 22% in 2019, compared to a 15% increase in net revenues in the same period. Acquisitions completed in 2018 had a negative impact of approximately one percentage point in our operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2019.

41
Net income increased by $402 million, or 20%, in 2019 as compared to 2018, due to an increase in operating income of $525 million and an increase in other income (expense), net of $97 million, driven primarily by net unrealized gains on strategic investments, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $220 million. 

Impact of Foreign Currency Exchange Rates

We have significant international operations that are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, subjecting us to foreign currency exchange risk which may adversely impact our financial results. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the British Pound, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Canadian Dollar, as well as other currencies in which we conduct our international operations, impacts the translation of our net revenues and expenses generated in these foreign currencies into the U.S. dollar. In 2019, 2018, and 2017, we generated approximately 47%, 46%, and 46% of our net revenues from customers domiciled outside of the United States, respectively. Because we generate substantial net revenues internationally, we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the U.S. as discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition.” 

We calculate the year-over-year impact of foreign currency movements on our business using prior period foreign currency exchange rates applied to current period transactional currency amounts. While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our reported results, we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we designate certain foreign currency exchange contracts as cash flow hedges intended to reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements. Gains and losses from these foreign currency exchange contracts are recognized as a component of transaction revenues in the same period the forecasted transactions impact earnings.

In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the year-over-year foreign currency movements relative to the U.S. dollar had the following impact on our reported results:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

While we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to help reduce the impact on earnings from foreign currency exchange rate movements, it is impossible to predict or eliminate the total effects of this exposure.

We also use a foreign currency exchange contract, designated as a net investment hedge, to reduce the foreign currency risk related to our investment in a foreign subsidiary. Gains and losses associated with this instrument will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income until the foreign subsidiary is sold or substantially liquidated. 

Additionally, in connection with our services that are paid for in multiple currencies, we generally set our foreign currency exchange rates daily and may face financial exposure if we incorrectly set our foreign currency exchange rates or as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the times that we set our foreign currency exchange rates. Given that we also have foreign currency exchange risk on our assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our subsidiaries, we have an additional foreign currency exchange exposure management program whereby we use foreign currency exchange contracts to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency exchange gains and losses on our assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense), net, and are offset by the gains and losses on the foreign currency exchange contracts. These foreign currency exchange contracts reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. 

42
Financial Results

Net revenues

Our revenues are classified into the following two categories:

•Transaction revenues: Net transaction fees charged to merchants and consumers on a transaction basis primarily based on the volume of activity, or Total Payment Volume (“TPV”), completed on our Payments Platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable on our Payments Platform. Payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed through our Payments Platform, or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution not including gateway-exclusive transactions. We earn additional fees on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or Venmo account to their debit card or bank account, and other miscellaneous fees.

•Other value added services: Net revenues derived primarily from revenue earned through partnerships, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues from interest and fees earned primarily on our portfolio of merchant and consumer loans receivable, and interest earned on certain PayPal customer account balances.

Our revenues can be significantly impacted by the following:

•The mix of merchants, products, and services;

•The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;

•The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and

•The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.

Net revenues analysis

The components of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Transaction revenues

Transaction revenues increased by $2.4 billion, or 17%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to growth in TPV, mainly from our PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo products, and growth in the number of payment transactions, both of which resulted primarily from an increase in our active accounts. Fees charged to facilitate instant transfer of funds for our customers contributed approximately two percentage points and acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction revenues in 2019. Net gains from our foreign currency exchange contracts recognized as a component of transaction revenues in 2019 were $238 million, compared to net losses of $23 million in 2018. Refer to “Note 10—Derivative Instruments” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our foreign currency exposure management program. 

43
The following table provides a summary of our active accounts, number of payment transactions, TPV, and related metrics:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

All amounts in tables are rounded to the nearest million except as otherwise noted. As a result, certain amounts may not recalculate using the rounded amounts provided.

(1) Reflects active accounts as of the end of the applicable period. An active account is an account registered directly with PayPal or a platform access partner that has completed a transaction on our Payments Platform, not including gateway-exclusive transactions, within the past 12 months. A platform access partner is a third party whose customers are provided access to PayPal’s Payments Platform through such third party’s login credentials.

(2) Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.

(3) Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12 month period, divided by active accounts at the end of the period.

(4) TPV is the value of payments, net of reversals, successfully completed on our Payments Platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions. 

** Not meaningful

Transaction revenues grew more slowly than both TPV and the number of payment transactions in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a higher proportion of P2P transactions (primarily from our Venmo and PayPal products) from which we earn lower fees, and a lower proportion of cross border transactions, partially offset by foreign currency exchange hedging gains. Changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2019.

Other value added services

Net revenues from other value added services decreased by $69 million, or 4%, in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to lower interest and fee income earned on our consumer loans receivable driven by the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018. The decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue share with Synchrony (discussed below), an increase in interest and fee income earned on our merchant loans and advances receivable, and an increase in interest earned resulting from growth in customer balances. Other value added services revenues included approximately $113 million and $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively, due to revenue earned from transition servicing activities provided to Synchrony, which ended in the second quarter of 2019. Acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of other value added services revenues in 2019.

The total gross consumer and merchant loans receivable balance, including loans and receivable held for sale, as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $4.2 billion, $2.7 billion, and $7.8 billion, respectively. The year-over-year increase of 56% in 2019 compared to 2018, was driven by an increase in both our merchant loans and international consumer loan portfolios. The year-over-year decrease of 66% in 2018 compared to 2017, was driven by the completion of the sale of U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio.

In November 2017, we reached an agreement to sell our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony to free up balance sheet capacity and cash flow for other uses and mitigate balance sheet risk. Following the closing of this transaction in July 2018, Synchrony became the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S., and we no longer hold an ownership interest in the receivables generated through the program. Subsequent to the sale, we earn a revenue share on the portfolio of consumer receivables owned by Synchrony, which is recorded in net revenues from other value added services. 

44
Operating Expenses

Beginning with the first quarter of 2019, we reclassified certain operating expenses within our consolidated statements of income. Prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to this presentation. These changes have no impact on our previously reported consolidated net income for prior periods, including total operating expenses, financial position, or cash flows for any periods presented. For additional information, see “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Growth rates presented below are calculated based upon the reclassified prior period amounts.

The following table summarizes our operating expenses and related metrics we use to assess the trends in each:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED](1) Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect the classification changes discussed above.

(2) Transaction expense rate is calculated by dividing transaction expense by TPV. 

(3) Transaction and loan loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction and loan losses by TPV. 

Transaction expense

Transaction expense is primarily composed of the costs we incur to accept a customer’s funding source of payment. These costs include fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions to draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding source they have stored in their digital wallet. Transaction expense also includes fees paid to disbursement partners to enable a transaction. We refer to the allocation of funding sources used by our consumers as our “funding mix.” The cost of funding a transaction with a credit or debit card is generally higher than the cost of funding a transaction from a bank or through internal sources such as a PayPal account balance, a Venmo account balance, or PayPal Credit. As we expand the availability and presentation of alternative funding sources to our customers, our funding mix may change, which could increase or decrease our transaction expense rate. The cost of funding a transaction is also impacted by the geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs because we generally pay lower rates for transactions funded with credit cards outside the U.S. than in the U.S. Our transaction expense rate is impacted by changes in product mix, regional mix, funding mix, and assessments charged by payment processors and other financial institutions when we draw funds from a customer’s credit or debit card, bank account, or other funding sources. 

Transaction expense increased by $1.2 billion, or 22%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily attributable to an increase in TPV of 23%. Acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately one percentage point to the growth rate of transaction expense in 2019. The decrease in transaction expense rate in 2019 compared to 2018 was due primarily to changes in product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 2% of TPV was funded with PayPal Credit. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, approximately 41%, 43%, and 43% of TPV, respectively, was generated outside of the U.S. 

Transaction and loan losses

Transaction losses include the expense associated with our buyer and seller protection programs, fraud, and chargebacks. Loan losses include the losses associated with our merchant and consumer loans receivable portfolio, except loans and interest receivable, held for sale. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products for consumers and loans and advances to merchants. 

45
The components of our transaction and loan losses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Transaction loss rate is calculated by dividing transaction losses by TPV. 

Transaction and loan losses increased by $106 million, or 8%, in 2019 compared to 2018. 

Transaction losses increased by $33 million, or 3%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due to growth in TPV, partially offset by benefits realized through improvements in risk management capabilities, which also contributed to a decrease in our transaction loss rate over the same period. 

Loan losses increased by $73 million, or 34%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to growth in our merchant loans and advances and international consumer loans receivable balances, partially offset by the recognition of losses in 2018 associated with U.S. consumer credit receivable balances that were not subject to the sale agreement with Synchrony. Acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate of loan losses for 2019.

The consumer loans receivable balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $1.3 billion and $704 million, respectively. The year-over-year increase of 88% in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to growth in international markets. Approximately 94% and 93% of our consumer loans receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. 

The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Represents percentage of balances which are 90 days past the billing date to the consumer.

(2) Net charge off rate is the annual ratio of net credit losses on consumer loans receivables as a percentage of the average daily amount of consumer loans and interest receivables balance during the year. 

We offer business financing solutions to certain small and medium-sized merchants. Total merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable outstanding, net of participation interest sold, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $2.8 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. The year-over-year increase of 50% in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to growth in our PayPal Business Loan portfolio and an increase in the availability of our PayPal Working Capital product. Approximately 83% and 10% of our merchant receivables outstanding as of December 31, 2019 were due from merchants in the U.S. and U.K., as compared to 87% and 10% as of December 31, 2018, respectively. 

The following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable balance:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes $30 million of loan receivables related to iZettle merchant receivables.

46
Modifications to the acceptable risk parameters of our PayPal credit products for the periods presented did not have a material impact on our loans and interest receivables. For additional information, see “Note 11—Loans and Interest Receivable” in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Some of our credit products expose us to additional risks.” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Customer support and operations

Customer support and operations includes (a) costs incurred in our global customer operations centers, including costs to provide call support to our customers, (b) costs to support our trust and security programs protecting our merchants and consumers, and (c) other costs incurred related to the delivery of our products, including payment devices, card production, and customer onboarding and compliance costs.

Customer support and operations costs increased $208 million, or 15%, in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in 2019 was primarily attributable to an increase in employee-related expenses in our operations function that support the growth of our active accounts and payment transactions, and an increase in depreciation and amortization expenses associated with the applications that we use to support our customers and underlying data in our operations centers. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately three percentage points to the growth rate of customer support and operations costs in 2019. 

Sales and marketing

Sales and marketing includes costs incurred for customer acquisition, business development, advertising, and marketing programs. 

Sales and marketing expenses increased $87 million, or 7%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses, amortization of acquired intangibles, and consulting services, partially offset by lower spend on marketing programs. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately eight percentage points to the growth rate of sales and marketing expenses in 2019, primarily due to amortization of acquired intangibles. 

Technology and development

Technology and development includes (a) costs incurred in connection with the development of our Payments Platform, new products, and the improvement of our existing products, including the amortization of software and website development costs incurred in developing our Payments Platform, which are capitalized, and acquired developed technology, and (b) our site operations and other infrastructure costs incurred to support our Payments Platform.

Technology and development expenses increased $254 million, or 14%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses, and to a lesser extent in data center and cloud computing services utilized in delivering our products, and amortization of acquired intangibles, partially offset by a decline in costs related to contractors and consultants. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of technology and development expenses in 2019. 

General and administrative

General and administrative includes costs incurred to provide support to our business, including legal, human resources, finance, risk, compliance, executive, and other support operations. 

General and administrative expenses increased $170 million, or 11%, in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to increases in employee-related expenses, and to a lesser extent in facilities costs, and depreciation and amortization associated with systems and tools used in our general and administrative functions. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in professional service expenses, including those related to acquisition related transaction expenses incurred in 2018. Our acquisitions completed in 2018 contributed approximately four percentage points to the growth rate of general and administrative expenses in 2019. 

47
Restructuring and other charges

Restructuring and other charges primarily consist of restructuring expenses and cost adjustments related to our loans and receivables, held for sale portfolio. Restructuring and other charges decreased by $238 million in 2019 compared to 2018, due primarily to the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio in July 2018, prior to which adjustments to the cost basis of loans and interest receivables held for sale were recorded within restructuring and other charges. This decline was partially offset by an increase in restructuring charges of $53 million in 2019 as compared to 2018. Additionally, in 2019, we recorded a gain of $7 million representing an adjustment to the loss from additional expenses incurred associated with the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio to Synchrony.

In the first quarter of 2019 and 2018, management approved strategic reductions of the existing global workforce, which resulted in restructuring charges of $78 million and $25 million, respectively. The approved strategic reductions for 2019 were intended to better align our teams to support key business priorities and also included the transfer of certain operational functions between geographies, as well as the impact of the transition of servicing activities provided to Synchrony, which terminated in the second quarter of 2019. The estimated annual employee-related costs associated with the impacted workforce is approximately $175 million. The majority of the reduction in annual costs associated with the impacted workforce was reinvested in the business. The strategic reduction approved in the first quarter of 2018 included restructuring charges related to the decision to wind down TIO’s operations. We incurred primarily employee and severance benefits expenses under both the 2019 and 2018 strategic reductions, which were substantially completed by the end of 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Other income (expense), net

Other income (expense), net increased $97 million, or 53%, in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily driven by net unrealized gains on strategic investments due to favorable changes in fair value related to our marketable equity securities and the positive impact of observable price changes related to our non-marketable equity securities, which collectively contributed to incremental net gains of $121 million year over year. This increase was partially offset by incremental interest expense associated with the long term debt issued in the third quarter of 2019.

Income tax expense 

Our effective tax rate was 18% in 2019 and 13% in 2018. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2019 was primarily the result of taxes associated with the intra-group transfer of intellectual property related to the acquisition of iZettle. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information on our effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

We require liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations, including customer protection programs, our credit products, capital expenditures, investments in our business, potential acquisitions and strategic investments, working capital, and other cash needs. The following table summarizes our cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2019 and 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Excludes assets related to funds receivable and customer accounts of $22.5 billion and $20.1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(2) Excludes total restricted cash of $64 million and $77 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and strategic investments of $1.8 billion and $293 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

48
Foreign Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Investments

Cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by our foreign subsidiaries were $7.2 billion as of December 31, 2019 and $8.7 billion as of December 31, 2018, or 61% and 89% of our total cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of those respective dates. At December 31, 2019, all of our cash, cash equivalents, and investments held by foreign subsidiaries were subject to U.S. taxation under Subpart F, Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”), or the one-time Transition Tax as further discussed in “Note 16—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Subsequent repatriations to the U.S. will not be taxable from a U.S. federal tax perspective, but may be subject to state or foreign withholding tax. A significant aspect of our global cash management activities involves meeting our customers’ requirements to access their cash while simultaneously meeting our regulatory financial ratio commitments in various jurisdictions. Our global cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our businesses, but also to support our global regulatory requirements across our regulated subsidiaries. As such, not all of our cash is available for general corporate purposes.

Available Credit and Debt

On September 26, 2019, we issued fixed rate notes with varying maturity dates for an aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion (collectively referred to as the “Notes”). Proceeds from the issuance of these Notes may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include funding the repayment or redemption of outstanding debt, share repurchases, ongoing operations, capital expenditures, and possible acquisitions of businesses, assets, or strategic investments.

On September 11, 2019, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $5.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility that includes a $150 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $500 million swingline sub-facility, with available borrowings under the revolving credit facility reduced by the amount of any letters of credit and swingline borrowings outstanding from time to time. Additionally, on September 11, 2019, we entered into a 364-day credit agreement (“364-Day Credit Agreement”) that provides for an unsecured $1.0 billion 364-day revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, no borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement, and as such, $6.0 billion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement, subject to customary conditions to borrowing. Upon our entry into the Credit Agreement, the credit agreement that we entered into in the third quarter of 2015 providing for an unsecured $2.0 billion, five-year revolving credit facility was terminated.

In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into an amended credit agreement (“Amended Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated in its entirety the previous agreement entered into in 2017. The Amended Credit Agreement provided for an unsecured $5.0 billion, 364-day delayed-draw term loan credit facility, which was available in up to four separate borrowings until April 6, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, $2.0 billion was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. On April 5, 2019, the Company drew down an additional $500 million under the Amended Credit Agreement. On September 26, 2019, the Amended Credit Agreement was terminated and we repaid $2.5 billion of borrowings outstanding under that agreement.

We also maintain committed and uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world, with borrowing capacity of approximately $230 million in the aggregate. This available credit, a portion of which is guaranteed by PayPal, includes facilities where we can withdraw and utilize the funds at our discretion for general corporate purposes, capital expenditures, and acquisitions.

Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. As of December 31, 2019, substantially all of the borrowing capacity under these credit facilities was available, subject to customary conditions to borrowing.

For additional information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

We have cash pooling arrangements with a financial institution for cash management purposes. Each arrangement allows for cash withdrawals from the financial institution based upon our aggregate operating cash balances held within the financial institution (“Aggregate Cash Deposits”). Each arrangement also allows us to withdraw amounts exceeding the Aggregate Cash Deposits up to an agreed-upon limit. The net balance of the withdrawals and the Aggregate Cash Deposits are used by the financial institution as a basis for calculating our net interest expense or income under each arrangement. As of December 31, 2019, we had a total of $3.5 billion in cash withdrawals offsetting our $3.5 billion in Aggregate Cash Deposits held within the financial institution under the cash pooling arrangements.

Liquidity for Credit Portfolio Growth 

Growth in the portfolio of loan receivables increases our liquidity needs, and any failure to meet those liquidity needs could adversely affect our business. We continue to evaluate partnerships and third party sources of funding for our credit portfolio. In June 2018, the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the “CSSF”) agreed that PayPal’s management may designate up to 35% of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used for European and U.S. credit activities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, an additional amount of $500 million was designated by management to fund such credit activities. As of December 31, 2019, the cumulative amount approved by management to be designated for credit activities aggregated to $2.0 billion and represented approximately 31% of European customer balances potentially available for corporate use by us at that date as determined by applying financial regulations maintained by the CSSF. We may periodically seek to designate additional amounts of customer balances, if necessary, based on utilization of the approved funds and anticipated credit funding requirements. Our objective is to expand the availability of our credit products with capital from external sources, although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that goal. Under certain exceptional circumstances, corporate liquidity could be called upon to meet our obligations related to our European customer balances.

Credit Ratings

As of December 31, 2019, we continue to be rated investment grade by Standard and Poor’s Financial Services, LLC and Fitch Ratings, Inc. We expect that these credit rating agencies will continue to monitor our performance, including our capital structure and results of operations. Our goal is to be rated investment grade, but as circumstances change, there are factors that could result in our credit ratings being downgraded or put on a watch list for possible downgrading. If that were to occur, it could increase our borrowing rates, including the interest rate on loans under our credit agreements.

Risk of Loss

The risk of losses from our buyer and seller protection programs are specific to individual customers, merchants, and transactions, and may also be impacted by regional variations in, and changes or modifications to, the programs, including as a result of changes in regulatory requirements. For the periods presented in these consolidated financial statements included in this report, our transaction loss rates ranged between 0.15% and 0.18% of TPV. Historical loss rates may not be indicative of future results. 

Stock Repurchases and Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of our common stock, including approximately $656 million in the open market and approximately $750 million pursuant to the accelerated share repurchase agreement under our stock repurchase program authorized in April 2017. As of December 31, 2019, a total of approximately $68 million and $10 billion remained available for future repurchases of our common stock under our April 2017 and July 2018 stock repurchase programs, respectively. For additional information, see “Note 14—Stock Repurchase Programs” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

In January 2020, we completed our acquisition of Honey Science Corporation (“Honey”) for approximately $3.6 billion in cash and approximately $400 million in restricted stock, subject to vesting conditions. We believe our acquisition of Honey will enhance our value proposition by allowing us to further simplify and personalize shopping experiences for consumers while driving conversion and increasing consumer engagement and sales for merchants.

Other Considerations

Our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could be adversely impacted by declines in our credit rating, our financial performance, and global credit market conditions, as well as a broad range of other factors. In addition, our liquidity, access to capital, and borrowing costs could also be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risk Factors That May Affect Our Business, Results of Operations, and Financial Condition” and “Note 13—Commitments and Contingencies” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business.

We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments, cash expected to be generated from operations, and our expected access to capital markets, together with potential external funding through third party sources, will be sufficient to fund our operating activities, anticipated capital expenditures, and our credit products for the foreseeable future. Depending on market conditions, we may from time to time issue debt, including in private or public offerings, to fund our operating activities, finance acquisitions, make strategic investments, repurchase shares under our share repurchase programs, or reduce our cost of capital.

Cash Flows

The following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Cash flows from operating activities includes net income adjusted for certain non-cash expenses, timing differences between expenses recognized for provision for transaction and loan losses and actual cash transaction losses incurred, and changes in other assets and liabilities. Significant non-cash expenses for the period include depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. The cash impact from actual transaction losses incurred during a period is reflected as a negative impact to changes in other assets and liabilities in cash from operating activities. The expenses recognized during the period for provision for loan losses are estimates of probable incurred losses on our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017). Actual charge-offs of receivables related to our consumer and merchant credit products (excluding the U.S. consumer credit portfolio from and after November 2017) have no impact on cash from operating activities.

We generated cash from operating activities of $4.6 billion in 2019 due primarily to operating income of $2.7 billion. During 2019, adjustments for non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation were $1.0 billion, depreciation and amortization were $912 million, and provision for transaction and loan losses were $1.4 billion, partially offset by adjustments related to deferred income taxes of $269 million and net unrealized gains on our strategic investments of $207 million in 2019. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by the changes in other assets and liabilities of $433 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period partially offset by an increase in funds payable and amounts due to customers, and an increase in accounts receivable of $120 million.

We generated cash from operating activities of $5.5 billion in 2018 due primarily to operating income of approximately $2.2 billion and the positive impact of $1.4 billion of changes in loans and interest receivable, held for sale, net following the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio. Adjustments for non-cash expenses of stock-based compensation were $853 million and depreciation and amortization were $776 million during 2018. Adjustments for non-cash expenses related to the provision for transaction and loan losses were approximately $1.3 billion and cost basis adjustments to loans and interest receivable held for sale were $244 million during 2018. The cash generated from operating activities was negatively impacted by changes in other assets and liabilities of $708 million, primarily related to actual cash transaction losses incurred during the period. 

Cash paid for income taxes, net in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $665 million, $328 million, and $117 million, respectively.

Investing Activities

Cash flows from investing activities includes purchases, maturities and sales of investments, cash paid for acquisitions and strategic investments, purchases and sales of property and equipment, changes in principal loans receivable, and funds receivable. 

The net cash used in investing activities of $5.7 billion in 2019 was due primarily to purchases of investments of $27.9 billion, changes in principal loans receivable, net of $1.6 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $704 million, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $342 million. These cash outflows were partially offset by maturities and sales of investments of $24.9 billion.

We generated cash from investing activities of $840 million in 2018 due primarily to maturities and sales of investments of $21.9 billion, changes in principal loans receivable, net of $3.1 billion, and changes in funds receivable from customers of $1.1 billion. These cash inflows were offset by purchases of investments of $22.4 billion, acquisitions of $2.1 billion (net of cash and restricted cash acquired), and purchases of property and equipment of $823 million. 

51
Financing Activities

Cash flows from financing activities includes proceeds from issuance of common stock, purchases of treasury stock, tax withholdings related to net share settlements of equity awards, borrowings and repayments under financing arrangements, and funds payable and amounts due to customers. 

We generated cash from financing activities of $3.7 billion in 2019 due primarily to $5.5 billion of cash proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt in the form of fixed rate notes as well as borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement, and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $2.5 billion. These cash inflows were partially offset by repayment of borrowings under our Amended Credit Agreement of $2.5 billion, the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $504 million.

The net cash used in financing activities of $1.3 billion in 2018 was due primarily to the repurchase of $3.5 billion of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs, repayments of borrowing under financing arrangements of $1.1 billion, and tax withholdings related to net share settlement of equity awards of $419 million, partially offset by cash inflows from borrowings under financing arrangements of $2.1 billion and changes in funds payable and amounts due to customers of $1.6 billion. 

Effect of Exchange Rates on Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash

Foreign currency exchange rates had a negative effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash during 2019 and 2018 of $6 million and $113 million, respectively. The negative impact in 2018 was due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against certain foreign currencies, primarily the Australian dollar and to a lesser extent, the Euro. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.

Future Liquidity and Obligations

As of December 31, 2019, approximately $3.1 billion of unused credit was available to PayPal Credit account holders compared to $1.8 billion of unused credit as of December 31, 2018. While this amount represents the total unused credit available, we have not experienced, and do not anticipate, that all our PayPal Credit account holders will access their entire available credit at any given point in time. In addition, the individual lines of credit that make up this unused credit are subject to periodic review and termination based on, among other things, account usage and customer creditworthiness. 

We have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments for general operating purposes. Changes in our business needs, contractual cancellation provisions, fluctuating interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates. We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of these payments. The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2019 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through our existing cash and investment portfolio and cash expected to be generated from operations. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

52
The significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the above table are as follows:

•Purchase obligation amounts include minimum purchase commitments for advertising, capital expenditures (computer equipment, software applications, engineering development services, and construction contracts), and other goods and services entered into in the ordinary course of business.

•Operating lease amounts include minimum rental payments under our non-cancelable operating leases (including leases not yet commenced) primarily for office and data center facilities. The amounts presented are consistent with contractual terms and are not expected to differ significantly from actual results under our existing leases, unless a substantial change in our headcount needs requires us to expand our occupied space or exit an office facility early.

•Transition Tax represents the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred foreign earnings under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), as further discussed in “Note 16—Income Taxes” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

•Long-term debt amounts represent the future principal and interest payments (based on contractual interest rates) on our fixed-rate debt. For more information, see “Note 12—Debt” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits, net, the table above does not include $990 million of such non-current liabilities included in deferred and other tax liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.

Seasonality

The Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2019, 2018, or 2017 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The application of U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect our reported financial condition. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to provide reasonable assurance that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to our financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection, and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies, including recent accounting pronouncements, are described in “Note 1—Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated, and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity are included to allow users of this report to understand a general directional cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

Transaction and loan losses

Transaction and loan losses include the expense associated with our customer protection programs, fraud, chargebacks, and credit losses associated with our loans receivable balances. Our transaction and loan losses fluctuate depending on many factors, including: total TPV, macroeconomic conditions, changes to our customer protection programs, the impact of regulatory changes, and the credit quality of loans receivable arising from transactions funded with our credit products, which include our PayPal Credit consumer product and merchant loans and advances arising from our PayPal Working Capital (“PPWC”) and PayPal Business Loan (“PPBL”) products.

53
We establish allowances for estimated transaction losses arising from processing customer transactions, such as chargebacks for unauthorized credit card use and merchant-related chargebacks due to non-delivery of goods or services, ACH returns, buyer protection program claims, account takeovers, and account overdrafts. Additions to the allowance, in the form of provisions, are reflected in transaction and loan losses on our consolidated statements of income. The allowances are monitored regularly and are updated based on actual claims data. The allowances are based on known facts and circumstances, internal factors including experience with similar cases, historical trends involving loss payment patterns, and the mix of transaction and loss types.

We also establish an allowance for loans receivable, which represents our estimate of probable incurred loan losses inherent in our merchant loans and advances and consumer loans receivable. Increases to the allowance for loans receivable are reflected as transaction and loan losses on our consolidated financial statements. This evaluation process is subject to numerous estimates and judgments. For our consumer loan receivables, consisting primarily of our international consumer receivables, the allowance is primarily based on forecasted principal balance delinquency rates (“roll rates”). Roll rates are the percentage of balances which we estimate will migrate from one stage of delinquency to the next based on our historical experience, as well as external factors such as estimated bankruptcies and levels of unemployment. Roll rates are applied to the principal amount of our consumer loan receivables for each stage of delinquency, from current to 180 days past the payment due date, to estimate the principal loans which have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. For merchant loans and advances the allowance is primarily based on principal balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model.

The allowance for loss against the interest receivable is determined primarily by applying historical average customer account roll rates to the interest receivable balance in each stage of delinquency to project the value of accounts that have incurred losses and are probable to be charged off. The allowance for fees receivable is primarily based on fee balances, forecasted delinquency rates, and recoveries through the use of a vintage-based loss forecasting model. Increases to the allowance for interest receivable are reflected as a reduction of net revenues on our consolidated statements of income. Increases to the allowance for fees receivable are recognized as a reduction in deferred revenues included in other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.

Determining appropriate allowances for these losses is an inherently uncertain process and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates. We regularly update our allowance estimates as new facts become known and events occur that may impact the settlement or recovery of losses. The allowances are maintained at a level we deem appropriate to adequately provide for losses incurred at the balance sheet date. Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2019, an aggregate ten percent increase in our transaction and loan loss rate would negatively impact transaction and loan losses by approximately $138 million.

Accounting for Income Taxes 

Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates, and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective government taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rates that apply to our foreign earnings. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, our income tax rate depends on the extent that our foreign earnings are taxed by the U.S. through new provisions under the Tax Act such as the GILTI tax and base erosion anti-abuse tax or as a result of our indefinite reinvestment assertion. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management’s judgment about, and intentions concerning, our future operations. 

Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. Such assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings, and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely heavily on estimates that are based on a number of factors, including our historical experience and short-range and long-range business forecasts. To the extent deferred tax assets are not expected to be realized, we record a valuation allowance.

We recognize and measure uncertain tax positions in accordance with U.S. GAAP, pursuant to which we only recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. U.S. GAAP further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter in which such change occurs. We recognize interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

54
We file annual income tax returns in multiple taxing jurisdictions around the world. A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited by the relevant tax authorities and finally resolved. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for income taxes are adequate such that we reflect the benefits more likely than not to be sustained in an examination. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest and penalties, where appropriate in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular position could require the use of cash.

Based on our results for the year ended December 31, 2019, a one-percentage point increase in our effective tax rate would have resulted in an increase in our income tax expense of approximately $30 million.

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims, regulatory and legal proceedings, and investigations of potential operating violations by regulatory oversight authorities. We regularly review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim, legal proceeding, or potential regulatory violation is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims, litigation, or other violations and may revise our estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes.

Revenue Recognition

Application of the accounting principles in U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting. Specifically, the determination of whether we are a principal to a transaction (gross revenue) or an agent (net revenue) can require considerable judgment. Further, we provide incentive payments to consumers and merchants, which require judgment to determine whether the payments should be recorded as a reduction to gross revenue. Changes in judgments with respect to these assumptions and estimates could impact the amount of revenue recognized. 

Valuation of Goodwill and Intangibles

The valuation of assets acquired in a business combination and asset impairment reviews require the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in an acquired business to properly allocate purchase price consideration between assets that are depreciated and amortized and goodwill. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and, if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which do not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

We evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. Under U.S. GAAP, the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment allows for a qualitative assessment to be performed, which is similar to the U.S. GAAP for evaluating goodwill for impairment. In performing these qualitative assessments, we consider relevant events and conditions, including but not limited to: macroeconomic trends, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, cost factors, company-specific events, legal and regulatory factors, and our market capitalization. If the qualitative assessments indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than their carrying amounts, we must perform a quantitative impairment test.

Under the quantitative impairment test, if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value of the respective reporting unit goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset, an impairment loss is recorded in the statement of income. Measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit is based on one or more of the following fair value measures: amounts at which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, present value techniques of estimated future cash flows, valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue, or a similar performance measure.
