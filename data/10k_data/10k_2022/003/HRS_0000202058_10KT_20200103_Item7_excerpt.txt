BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

General

We generate revenue, income and cash flows by developing, manufacturing or providing, and selling advanced, technology-based solutions that meet government and commercial customers’ mission-critical needs. We support government and commercial customers in 130 countries, with our largest customers being various departments and agencies of the U.S. Government and their prime contractors. Our products, systems and services have defense and civil government applications, as well as commercial applications. As of January 3, 2020, we had approximately 50,000 employees, including approximately 20,000 engineers and scientists. We generally sell directly to our customers, and we utilize agents and intermediaries to sell and market some products and services, especially in international markets.

We structure our operations primarily around the products, systems and services we sell and the markets we serve. As discussed in “Item 1: Business” and Note 25: Business Segments in the Notes, we implemented a new organizational structure effective on June 29, 2019, and starting with the Fiscal Transition Period, we report the financial results of our continuing operations in the following four reportable segments, which are also referred to as our business segments:

•Integrated Mission Systems, including multi-mission ISR and communication systems; integrated electrical and electronic systems for maritime platforms; and advanced EO/IR solutions;

•Space and Airborne Systems, including space payloads, sensors and full-mission solutions; classified intelligence and cyber defense; avionics; and electronic warfare;

•Communication Systems, including tactical communications; broadband communications; integrated vision solutions; and public safety; and

•Aviation Systems, including defense aviation products; security, detection and other commercial aviation products; commercial and military pilot training; and mission networks for ATM.

The historical results, discussion and presentation of our business segments as set forth in this MD&A reflect the impact of these changes for all periods presented in order to present segment information on a comparable basis. There is no impact on our 

 33

previously reported consolidated statements of income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows or statements of equity resulting from these changes. 

See Note 25: Business Segments in the Notes for further information regarding our business segments, including how we define segment operating income or loss. 

As discussed in further detail in Note 5: Business Combination and Note 4: Restructuring and Other Exit Costs in the Notes, in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, we recorded $532 million of charges at our corporate headquarters in connection with the L3Harris Merger, consisting of restructuring, integration, transaction and other costs as follows:

•$142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold; 

•$117 million of costs for workforce reductions, including severance and other employee-related exit costs;

•$83 million of transaction costs, recognized as incurred;

•$72 million of integration costs, recognized as incurred;

•$70 million of equity award acceleration charges, recognized upon the change in control; and

•$48 million of impairment and other losses related to operating lease right-of-use assets.

All of the costs above were recorded in the “Engineering, selling and administrative expenses” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income, except for the $142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold, which is included in the “Cost of product sales and services” line item in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

As described in more detail in Note 3: Divestitures, Asset Sales and Discontinued Operations in the Notes, we completed the divestitures of the Harris Night Vision business during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and CapRock and IT Services in fiscal 2017. Through fiscal 2019, the Harris Night Vision business was reported as part of our former Communication Systems segment. As a result of the then-pending divestiture, the Harris Night Vision business was not included in any of our new business segments and, consequently, the operating results of the business are included in “Other non-reportable business segments” in this Report. CapRock and IT Services are reported as discontinued operations in this Report. Our historical financial results have been restated for all periods presented in this Report to account for businesses reported as discontinued operations in this Report. Except for disclosures related to our cash flows, or unless otherwise specified, disclosures in this Report relate solely to our continuing operations.

As described in more detail in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes, effective June 29, 2019, we changed our fiscal year end to the Friday nearest December 31, and the period that commenced on June 29, 2019 was a fiscal transition period that ended on January 3, 2020 (the “Fiscal Transition Period”). References herein to the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 represent the unaudited prior year results for the comparative period ended December 28, 2018.

Value Drivers of Our Business

In recent years, we have successfully integrated Exelis, reshaped our portfolio of businesses to focus on high-growth, high-margin, technology-differentiated businesses, combined with L3 in a transformative merger of equals and have made investments in technology and innovation that have led to several new product launches and strategic program awards. Execution of this multi-year strategy set the stage for financial results during the Fiscal Transition Period that have exceeded the targets we set at the beginning of the period. 

 The Fiscal Transition Period has been transformative. Our dedicated integration team executed its plan for a successful day one transition to the new L3Harris following the closing of the L3Harris Merger on June 29, 2019. We successfully implemented a new organizational structure, accelerated growth across all four business segments and expanded margins through our focus on operational excellence. We refinanced debt and made voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, expanding our future financial flexibility. We plan to build on our strong Fiscal Transition Period performance, and together with a well-funded U.S. Government budget and a continued focus on operational excellence and innovation, we believe we are well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities for fiscal 2020 and thereafter, which include the following: 

•Executing seamless integration of L3 and Harris, including achieving at least $500 million in gross cost synergies from the L3Harris Merger by the end of 2021;

•Driving flawless execution and margin expansion through our e3 (excellence everywhere every day) operational excellence program;

•Growing revenue through investments in differentiated technology and innovation;

•Reshaping our portfolio to focus on high margin, high growth businesses; and

•Maximizing cash flow with shareholder friendly capital deployment.

We are focused on successfully completing the integration of the two companies to maximize the benefits of the transformative merger. Our integration efforts focus on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and capturing opportunities to drive revenue growth, while maintaining our deep customer relationships, commercializing our technology and driving operational excellence.

 34

Our operational excellence program, e3 (excellence everywhere every day), is grounded in our deep commitment to excellence, innovation, customer satisfaction and continuous improvement in everything we do. Prior to the L3Harris Merger, we made substantial progress in laying the foundation of our future enterprise-wide digital strategy by standardizing our IT systems, reducing our number of enterprise resource planning platforms and simplifying our operating environment to drive productivity through growth in shared services and automation of core processes. We are working toward eliminating many of our data centers and making the remainder cloud-enabled. We also are continuing to focus on cost savings in our supply chain through “value engineering” and “should-cost” analysis, as well as improving supplier performance and reducing sole-sourced components on legacy solutions. We will continue these efforts as we integrate the two companies.

Innovation is at the core of our success, and R&D investment represents the foundation for innovation. We are

fundamentally reshaping how we design and develop new products to get more out of our R&D investment. We also use standardized processes and common metrics to track progress, gauge success and drive disciplined execution, as well as core technology centers to more fully leverage R&D investment across our Company. We are expanding implementation of “DevOps” to streamline software development, which has grown to be a significant portion of our engineering work today and is expected to increase over time. 

Our commitment to excellence and innovation carries through to the L3Harris Merger integration process. Our goal is to maximize the benefits of this transformative merger, creating significantly greater scale and bringing together two engineering-driven companies and workforces with similar cultures that value technology leadership. Together, the two companies’ complementary technologies and capabilities strengthen core franchises and provide new opportunities for innovation to solve our customers’ most complex challenges. We are combining top talent and technology from each company in a market-focused reorganization that will align with our strategic growth platforms and will help improve our competitive position, increase operational efficiency, and capture synergies, while we continue to bring innovative and affordable solutions to our customers. As our integration efforts focus on driving greater cost and operational efficiencies and revenue growth through synergies, we intend to maintain our focus on continuing to execute against our strategic priorities and other objectives - including satisfying our customers, driving operational excellence, improving cash flow and optimizing capital deployment. The L3Harris Merger also provides a unique opportunity for portfolio shaping actions, and we will continue to evaluate what businesses are strategic and what businesses are better served under a different owner. See Note 28: Subsequent Events in the Notes for additional information.

During the Fiscal Transition Period, we returned to our shareholders $337 million through dividends and $1,500 million through share repurchases and we used $109 million for net repayments of borrowings. In fiscal 2020, we believe accelerating revenue growth across our business segments and margin expansion will improve our operating cash flow, which we expect to use for increased dividends, share repurchases and investments in technology and innovation. 

Key Indicators

We believe our value drivers, when implemented, will improve our financial results, including: revenue; income from continuing operations and income from continuing operations per diluted common share; income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue; net cash provided by operating activities; return on invested capital; return on average equity; consolidated total indebtedness to total capital ratio; and net unfunded defined benefit plans liability. The measure of our success is reflected in our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources key indicators as discussed below.

Because the L3Harris Merger occurred on June 29, 2019, the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 reflect the results of the combined company, while the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 reflect the results of only Harris operating businesses. Due to the significance of the L3 operating businesses included in the combined company results following the L3Harris Merger, the reported results for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and December 28, 2018 generally are not comparable. Therefore, to assist with a discussion of the January 3, 2020 and December 28, 2018 consolidated results of operations on a more comparable basis, certain supplemental unaudited pro forma combined income statement information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X (referred to in this MD&A as “pro forma”) also is provided (see “Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement Information” below in this MD&A). 

Fiscal Transition Period Results of Operations Key Indicators: Revenue, income from continuing operations, income from continuing operations per diluted common share and income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue represent key measurements of our value drivers:

Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks

Department of Defense and Other U.S. Federal Markets: Our largest customers are various departments and agencies of the U.S. Government — the percentage of our revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 73 percent in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and approximately 77 percent, 75 percent and 74 percent in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 

On February 9, 2018, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (“BBA 2018”), a two-year budget agreement aimed to provide stability to the U.S. Government budget process for the government fiscal year (“GFY”) 2018 and GFY 2019 (U.S. Government fiscal years begin October 1 and end September 30). While the BBA 2018 raised the spending caps for GFY 2018 and GFY 2019 previously constrained by the Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”) and temporarily suspended the statutory debt ceiling through March 1, 2019, it did not modify the BCA’s spending caps or sequestration mechanisms beyond GFY 2019.

 36

On September 28, 2018, President Trump signed a final conference agreement on the GFY 2019 Defense Appropriations Bill into law, providing $716 billion for defense, including $647 billion in defense base funding and $69 billion for overseas contingency operations (“OCO”). Our major programs were fully funded and continue to remain priorities for U.S. Government customers. 

On August 2, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (“BBA 2019”), a two-year budget agreement for GFY 2020 and GFY 2021 that increased defense funding spending caps to $738 billion ($667 billion in defense base funding and $71 billion for OCO funding) for GFY 2020 and $741 billion ($672 billion in defense base funding and $69 billion for OCO funding) for GFY 2021, representing an increase of 3% from GFY 2019 funding levels. The BBA 2019 also temporarily suspended the statutory debt ceiling through July 31, 2021. The BBA 2019 builds on sustained funding increases Congress provided in GFY 2019, GFY 2018 and GFY 2017. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, which provides full-year funding through September 30, 2020 for the U.S. Government. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 provides $623 billion in base DoD funding and $71 billion in OCO funding, as well as $2 billion in emergency funding. Although we anticipate debate will continue within the U.S. Government over defense spending for future years (which may have a significant impact on defense spending broadly and on our specific programs), our programs have been well supported in recent years.

Government Oversight and Risk: As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to U.S. Government oversight. The U.S. Government may investigate our business practices and audit our compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Depending on the results of those investigations and audits, the U.S. Government could make claims against us. Under U.S. Government procurement regulations and practices, an indictment or conviction of a government contractor could result in that contractor being fined and/or suspended from being able to bid on, or from being awarded, new U.S. Government contracts for a period of time determined by the U.S. Government. Similar government oversight exists in most other countries where we conduct business.

For a discussion of risks relating to U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, see “Item 1. Business — Principal Customers; Government Contracts” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report. We are also subject to other risks associated with U.S. Government business, including technological uncertainties, dependence on annual appropriations and allotment of funds, extensive regulations and other risks, which are discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” of this Report.

State and Local: We also provide products to state and local government agencies that are committed to protecting our homeland and public safety. The public safety market was highly competitive and dependent on state and local government budgets during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020. Future market opportunities include upgrading aging analog infrastructure to new digital standards, as well as opportunities associated with next-generation LTE solutions for high data-rate applications.

International: We believe there is continuing international demand from military and government customers for tactical radios, public safety communications, electronic warfare equipment, ATM, electronic attack and release systems and ISR. We believe we can leverage our domain expertise and proven technology provided in the U.S. to further expand our international business.

We believe that our experience, technologies and capabilities are well aligned with the demand and requirements of the markets noted above in this Report. However, we remain subject to the spending levels, pace and priorities of the U.S. Government as well as international governments and commercial customers, and to general economic conditions that could adversely affect us, our customers and our suppliers. We also remain subject to other risks associated with these markets, including technological uncertainties, adoption of our new products and other risks that are discussed below in this Report under “Forward-Looking Statements and Factors that May Affect Future Results” and in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report.

As Reported

Revenue

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increase in revenue in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to the inclusion of $5.7 billion of revenue (net of intercompany sales eliminations) from L3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and organic revenue growth in all four segments. 

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in revenue in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher DoD tactical radio sales in our Communication Systems segment, reflecting a ramp in DoD modernization programs, higher Avionics and Electronic Warfare revenue from long-term avionics platforms, including the F-35, F/A-18 and F-16, and higher revenue from classified programs in our Space and Airborne Systems segment.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The increase in revenue in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher DoD tactical radio sales in our Communication Systems segment, reflecting readiness and modernization demand from the U.S. Army and USAF, and higher Avionics and Electronic Warfare revenue from long-term avionics platforms, including the F-35, F/A-18 and F-16, and higher revenue from C4ISR (including wireless solutions).

See the “Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

 39

Gross Margin

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: Gross margin increased in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 primarily due to the inclusion of L3 operations in operating results for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020. The decrease in gross margin as a percentage of revenue (“gross margin percentage”) for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to a mix of program revenue and product sales with relatively lower gross margin, $142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold and $42 million of amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the L3Harris Merger in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: Gross margin increased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily due to higher revenue and productivity savings, partially offset by higher employment costs. Gross margin percentage in fiscal 2019 was comparable with fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: Gross margin increased in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher revenue, partially offset by a 1 percentage point decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 reflected a less favorable mix of program revenue and product sales and an unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program, including a favorable contract settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the program transition from build-out to sustainment, partially offset by productivity savings and incremental pension income.

See the “Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increase in engineering, selling and administrative (“ESA”) expenses and ESA expenses as a percentage of revenue (“ESA percentage”) in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to the inclusion of L3 operations in operating results, as well as $390 million of charges for integration, restructuring and other costs associated with the L3Harris Merger and $197 million of amortization of identifiable intangible assets acquired as a result of the L3Harris Merger in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020. ESA expenses for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 also included a $12 million gain on sale of a product line, offset by a $10 million non-cash cumulative adjustment to lease expense.

Overall Company-sponsored R&D costs were $329 million in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with $144 million in the two quarters ended December 28, 2018. 

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in ESA expenses in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to $65 million of L3Harris Merger-related transaction and integration costs and increased investments in R&D and bids and proposals, partially offset by the absence in fiscal 2019 of $47 million of charges related to our decision to transition and exit a commercial air-to-ground LTE radio communications line of business and other items and a $12 million non-cash adjustment for deferred compensation, which were incurred in fiscal 2018. The decrease in ESA percentage in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to management of expenses on higher revenue.

Overall Company-sponsored R&D costs were $331 million in fiscal 2019 compared with $311 million in fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The increase in ESA expenses in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $47 million of charges related to our decision to transition and exit a commercial air-to-ground LTE radio communications line of business and other items, higher employment and distribution costs and a $12 million non-cash adjustment for deferred compensation, partially offset by a $53 million reduction in Exelis acquisition-related and other charges in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017. The decrease in ESA percentage in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to cost containment.

Overall Company-sponsored R&D costs were $311 million in fiscal 2018 compared with $310 million in fiscal 2017.

See the “Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Gain (loss) on Sale of Businesses

 The increase in gain (loss) on sale of businesses for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was due to a $229 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Harris Night Vision business, which was completed on September 13, 2019.

See Note 3: Divestitures, Asset Sales and Discontinued Operations in the Notes for further information.

Non-Operating Income 

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increase in non-operating income in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was 

 40

primarily due to an increase in the non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, including a $23 million gain on pension plan curtailment, reflecting the inclusion in pension and other postretirement benefit plan income of benefit plans assumed in connection with the L3Harris Merger.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in non-operating income in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to $27 million of losses and other costs related to debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The decrease in non-operating income in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to $27 million of losses and other costs related to debt refinancing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by a $20 million increase in pension and postretirement benefit income.

See Note 21: Non-Operating Income in the Notes for further information.

Net Interest Expense

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: Our net interest expense increased in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 primarily due to higher average debt levels as a result of the assumption of $3.5 billion of debt in connection with the L3Harris Merger. See Note 14: Debt in the Notes for further information.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: Our net interest expense decreased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of $281 million of net repayment of borrowings, which included our repayment at maturity of the entire outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due February 27, 2019. See Note 14: Debt in the Notes for further information.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: Our net interest expense decreased in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of $271 million of net repayment of borrowings, which included our repayment at maturity of the entire outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.999% Notes due April 27, 2018.

Income Taxes

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: In the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, our effective tax rate (income taxes as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes) benefited from the favorable impact of:

•Excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation;

•The ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards with a full valuation allowance against capital gains generated from the Harris Night Vision business divestiture; and

•The release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to statute of limitations expirations.

In the two quarters ended December 28, 2018, our effective tax rate benefited from the net favorable impact of:

•A reduction in the deferred tax liability maintained on the basis differences related to the unremitted foreign earnings;

•The favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation; and

•An increase in the R&D credit; partially offset by 

•An unfavorable impact of the differences in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and tax accounting related to investments.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: In fiscal 2019, our effective tax rate benefited from the net favorable impact of:

•Legislative changes from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which became applicable to Harris during fiscal 2019, such as: (i) a reduction in our U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate from the blended rate of 28.1% in fiscal 2018 to a flat 21% rate in fiscal 2019; (ii) the recent clarification that foreign military sales qualify for the foreign derived intangible income deduction; (iii) tax planning to allow for the utilization of foreign tax credits that were previously valued; and (iv) the loss of the U.S. domestic manufacturing deduction; 

•The favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation; and

•Additional research credits claimed on our prior year tax returns.

In fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate benefited from the net favorable impact of:

•The enactment of a lower U.S. statutory corporate income tax rate in fiscal 2018;

•Additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2017 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2017; and

•The favorable impact of releasing provisions for uncertain tax positions.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The major discrete items from which our fiscal 2018 effective tax rate benefited are those noted for fiscal 2018 in the preceding discussion under “Income Taxes.” In fiscal 2017, our effective tax rate benefited from:

 41

•The favorable impact of excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation;

•Several differences between U.S. GAAP and tax accounting related to investments; and

•Additional deductions and additional research credits claimed on our fiscal 2016 tax return compared with our recorded estimates at the end of fiscal 2016.

See Note 23: Income Taxes in the Notes for further information.

Income From Continuing Operations

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increase in income from continuing operations in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this “As Reported” discussion regarding the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and two quarters ended December 28, 2018.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this “As Reported” discussion regarding fiscal 2019 and 2018.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this “As Reported” discussion regarding fiscal 2018 and 2017.

Income From Continuing Operations Per Diluted Common Share Attributable to L3Harris Common Shareholders

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share attributable to L3Harris common shareholders in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations, as discussed above, partially offset by the increase in our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding as a result of approximately 104 million shares issued in connection with the L3Harris Merger. 

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was due to the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 and the decrease in average common shares outstanding from shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase program during fiscal 2019, partially offset by shares issued under our stock incentive and defined contribution plans and the incremental dilutive impact of share-based awards during fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018. 

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was due to the increase in income from continuing operations in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 and the decrease in diluted weighted average common shares outstanding from shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase program during fiscal 2018, partially offset by shares issued under our stock incentive and defined contribution plans and the incremental dilutive impact of share-based awards during fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017.

Pro Forma

Revenue

The increase in revenue for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma revenue for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to $321 million higher revenue in our Space and Airborne Systems segment, from a ramp in modernization of the F-35 platform in Mission Avionics, increased production of electronic warfare systems for F/A-18 and B-52 aircraft in Electronic Warfare and growth in ground-based adjacencies and exquisite systems in classified areas; $257 million higher revenue in our Integrated Mission Systems segment, driven by growth in all three businesses: ISR, Electro Optical and Maritime; $202 million higher revenue in our Communication Systems segment, from a ramp in DoD modernization programs in Tactical Communications and Integrated Vision Solutions as well as increased demand with state and federal customers in Public Safety and Professional Communications; and higher revenue in our Aviation Systems segment, reflecting organic growth from precision engagement sensors and systems, partially offset by the prior period competitive loss of the USAF C-17 training contract.

Gross Margin

The increase in gross margin and decrease in gross margin percentage for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma gross margin and gross margin percentage for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were primarily due to higher volume and strong operational performance, partially offset by $142 million of additional cost of sales related to the fair value step-up in inventory sold in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020.

 42

Engineering, Selling and Administrative Expenses

The increases in ESA expenses and ESA percentage for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma ESA expenses and ESA percentage for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were primarily due to $390 million of charges for integration, restructuring and other costs associated with the L3Harris Merger in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, partially offset by integration savings.

Gain (loss) on Sale of Businesses

 The increase in gain (loss) on sale of businesses for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma gain (loss) on sale of businesses for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was due to a $229 million pre-tax gain on the sale of the Harris Night Vision business, which was completed on September 13, 2019.

See Note 3: Divestitures, Asset Sales and Discontinued Operations in the Notes for further information.

Non-Operating Income 

The increase in non-operating income for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma non-operating income for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the non-service cost components of pension and other postretirement benefit plan income, including a $23 million gain on pension plan curtailment, in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and a $21 million debt extinguishment loss recognized by L3 in the two quarters ended December 28, 2018.

Net Interest Expense

The decrease in net interest expense for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma net interest expense for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to lower average debt levels as a result of the repayment at maturity of the entire outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due February 27, 2019. See Note 14: Debt in the Notes for further information.

Income Taxes

In the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, our effective tax rate benefited from the favorable impact of:

•Excess tax benefits related to equity-based compensation;

•The ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards with a full valuation allowance against capital gains generated from the Harris Night Vision business divestiture; and

•The release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to statute of limitations expirations.

See “Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement Information” below in this MD&A for information regarding our pro forma effective tax rate for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018.

Income From Continuing Operations

The increase in income from continuing operations for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma income from continuing operations for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to the combined effects of the reasons noted above in this “Pro Forma” discussion regarding the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and two quarters ended December 28, 2018.

Income From Continuing Operations Per Diluted Common Share Attributable to L3Harris Common Shareholders

The increase in income from continuing operations per diluted common share attributable to L3Harris common shareholders for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with pro forma income from continuing operations per diluted common share attributable to L3Harris common shareholders for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to higher income from continuing operations, as discussed above, and the decrease in our diluted weighted average common shares outstanding from shares of our common stock repurchased under our repurchase program during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020.

See the “Common Stock Repurchases” discussion below in this MD&A for further information.

Supplemental Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Income Statement Information 

The following supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement information prepared in accordance with the requirements of Article 11 of Regulation S-X provides further information supporting the preparation of the supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information for the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 provided above in the “Consolidated Results of Operations” discussion in this MD&A and has been prepared to give effect to the L3Harris Merger under the acquisition method of accounting. It combines the historical results of operations of Harris and L3 and reflects the L3Harris Merger as if it closed on June 30, 2018, the first day of Harris’ fiscal 2019, and gives effect to pro forma events that are (a) directly attributable to the L3Harris Merger, (b) factually supportable and (c) expected to have a continuing impact on our results of operations. The adjustments include adjustments to reflect the sale of the Harris Night Vision business, which is directly attributable to the L3Harris Merger, but do not include any adjustments for the use of proceeds from such sale, because the use is not directly attributable to the L3Harris Merger. The pro forma condensed combined income statement information is provided for informational and supplemental purposes only, and does not purport to indicate what L3Harris’ results of operations would have been, or L3Harris’ future results of operations, had the L3Harris Merger actually occurred on June 30, 2018. The supplemental unaudited pro forma condensed combined income statement information should be read in conjunction with other sections of this MD&A, our Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes appearing elsewhere in this Report.

Discussion of Business Segment Results of Operations

Integrated Mission Systems Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

__________

* Not meaningful

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increases in segment revenue, operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue (“operating margin percentage”) in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of L3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the L3Harris Merger during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020. Because the Integrated Mission Systems segment is almost entirely comprised of L3 businesses, comparison to prior year segment operating metrics is not meaningful. In the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, segment revenue also benefited from $213 million of revenue growth in ISR and growth in Electro Optical. The funded backlog for this segment was approximately $5.3 billion at January 3, 2020 compared with $5.4 billion at the beginning of the Fiscal Transition Period (including backlog acquired on June 29, 2019 in connection with the L3Harris Merger). Segment revenue, operating income and operating margin percentage were comparable and not material in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 75 percent in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020.

Space and Airborne Systems Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increases in segment revenue and operating income in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of L3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the L3Harris Merger during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, as well as higher revenue in Mission Avionics from growth on long-term platforms, $54 million higher revenue from growth in ground-based adjacencies and exquisite systems in classified areas and $58 million of higher revenue in Electronic Warfare from increased production of electronic warfare systems for F/A-18 and B-52 aircraft. Segment operating margin percentage in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 was comparable with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018. The funded backlog for this segment was approximately $3.9 billion at January 3, 2020 compared with $4.3 billion at the beginning of the Fiscal Transition Period (including backlog acquired on June 29, 2019 in connection with the L3Harris Merger). 

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 88 percent in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with 89 percent in the two quarters ended December 28, 2018.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in revenue in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher Mission Avionics and Electronic Warfare revenue from long-term avionics platforms, including the F-35, F/A-18, 

 46

F-16, CV-22 and B-52, and higher revenue from classified programs, driven by exquisite systems, small satellites and next generation technology, partially offset by lower revenue from environmental programs.

Segment operating income increased in fiscal 2019 and operating margin percentage was comparable with fiscal 2018, reflecting higher volume and strong program execution, offset by higher investments and employment costs.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 91 percent in fiscal 2019 compared with 90 percent in fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The increase in revenue in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher Mission Avionics and Electronic Warfare revenue from long-term avionics platforms, including the F-35, F/A-18 and F-16, higher revenue from classified programs, primarily driven by space superiority programs, and higher revenue from commercial customers, partially offset by lower civil revenue reflecting the impact of lower revenue from environmental programs.

Segment operating income and operating margin percentage increased in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017, reflecting higher volume, a more favorable mix of program revenue, incremental pension income, and productivity savings, partially offset by increased R&D investments, higher employment costs and the timing of other expense accruals. 

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 90 percent in fiscal 2018 compared with 89 percent in fiscal 2017.

Communication Systems Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increases in segment revenue and operating income in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of L3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the L3Harris Merger during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, as well as $112 million of higher revenue in Tactical Communications from a ramp in DoD modernization programs, $46 million of higher revenue in Public Safety, reflecting increased demand from state and federal customers, and $38 million of higher revenue in Integrated Vision Solutions. The funded backlog for this segment was approximately $3.7 billion at January 3, 2020 compared with $3.2 billion at the beginning of the Fiscal Transition Period (including backlog acquired on June 29, 2019 in connection with the L3Harris Merger). 

The decrease in segment operating margin percentage in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to a mix of program revenue and product sales with relatively lower operating margin percentage, partially offset by strong operational performance and integration savings.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 69 percent in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with 54 percent in the two quarters ended December 28, 2018.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The increase in revenue in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher revenue in Tactical Communications, driven by DoD Tactical from a ramp in DoD modernization programs, and higher revenue in Public Safety and Professional Communications from state and federal agencies.

Segment operating income and operating margin percentage increased in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018, reflecting higher volume and productivity savings, partially offset by increased investments in R&D and bids and proposals.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 53 percent in fiscal 2019 compared with 49 percent in fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The increase in revenue in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to higher DoD tactical radio sales, reflecting readiness and modernization demand from the U.S. Army and USAF.

 47

Segment operating income increased in fiscal 2018 and operating margin percentage was comparable with fiscal 2017, reflecting higher volume and productivity savings, partially offset by a less favorable mix of program revenue and product sales and higher employment costs.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 49 percent in fiscal 2018 compared with 46 percent in fiscal 2017.

Aviation Systems Segment

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Two quarters ended January 3, 2020 Compared With Two quarters ended December 28, 2018: The increases in segment revenue, operating income and operating margin percentage in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 were primarily due to the inclusion of L3 operations in segment operating results as a result of the L3Harris Merger during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020. Because the Aviation Systems segment is primarily comprised of L3 businesses, comparison to certain prior year segment operating metrics is not meaningful. In the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, segment revenue also reflected growth from precision engagement sensors and systems and $24 million of higher revenue in Mission Networks, partially offset by a $50 million revenue impact from the prior period competitive loss of the C-17 training contract. The funded backlog for this segment was approximately $3.4 billion at January 3, 2020 compared with $3.1 billion at the beginning of the Fiscal Transition Period (including backlog acquired on June 29, 2019 in connection with the L3Harris Merger). 

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 59 percent in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020.

Fiscal 2019 Compared With Fiscal 2018: The slight increase in revenue in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to higher Mission Networks revenue. The increase in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due improved operational performance and cost containment.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 86 percent in fiscal 2019 compared with 87 percent in fiscal 2018.

Fiscal 2018 Compared With Fiscal 2017: The slight decrease in revenue in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to lower Mission Networks revenue. The decrease in segment operating income and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2018 compared with fiscal 2017 was primarily due to a $36 million unfavorable impact from the ADS-B program, including a favorable contract settlement in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and the program transition from build-out to sustainment.

The percentage of this segment’s revenue that was derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, whether directly or through prime contractors, was approximately 87 percent in fiscal 2018 compared with 89 percent in fiscal 2017.

 LIQUIDITY, CAPITAL RESOURCES AND FINANCIAL STRATEGIES

Cash Flows

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash and cash equivalents 

The $294 million net increase in cash and cash equivalents during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 was primarily due to:

•$1,130 million of net cash acquired in the L3Harris Merger;

•$939 million of net cash provided by operating activities;

•$343 million of net proceeds from sale of business; and

•$109 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options; partially offset by

•$1,500 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock;

•$337 million used to pay cash dividends; 

•$173 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment;

•$109 million used for net repayments of borrowings, including $400 million in proceeds from the issuance of our 2.900% notes due December 15, 2029, $400 million used for our optional redemption of our 2.7% Notes due April 27, 2020 and $100 million used for repayment of short-term debt;

•$86 million used for tax withholding payments associated with vested share-based awards; and

•$38 million used in other financing activities.

The $242 million net increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2019 was primarily due to:

•$1,185 million of net cash provided by operating activities; and

•$50 million of proceeds from exercises of employee stock options; partially offset by

•$325 million used to pay cash dividends; 

•$281 million used for net repayments of borrowings, including repayment at maturity of the entire outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due February 27, 2019;

•$200 million used to repurchase shares of our common stock; 

•$161 million used for net additions of property, plant and equipment; and 

•$24 million used for tax withholding payments associated with vested share-based awards.

Refer to the Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 28, 2019 (our “Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K”) for discussion of the changes in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2018.

We ended the Fiscal Transition Period with cash and cash equivalents of $824 million, and we have a senior unsecured $2 billion revolving credit facility that expires in June 2024 (all of which was available to us as of January 3, 2020). Additionally, we had $6.7 billion of net long-term debt outstanding at January 3, 2020, the majority of which we incurred in connection with our the L3Harris Merger in the Fiscal Transition Period and the acquisition of Exelis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. For further information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 14: Debt in the Notes. Our $824 million of cash and cash equivalents at January 3, 2020 included $437 million held by our foreign subsidiaries, a significant portion of which can be repatriated to the U.S. with minimal tax cost.

Given our current cash position, outlook for funds generated from operations, credit ratings, available credit facility, cash needs and debt structure, we have not experienced to date, and do not expect to experience, any material issues with liquidity, although we can give no assurances concerning our future liquidity, particularly in light of our current level of debt, U.S. Government budget uncertainties and the state of global commerce and financial uncertainty.

 49

We also currently believe that existing cash, funds generated from operations, our credit facility and access to the public and private debt and equity markets will be sufficient to provide for our anticipated working capital requirements, capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program and repayments of our debt securities at maturity for the next twelve months and reasonably foreseeable future thereafter. Our total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately $400 million. We anticipate tax payments for fiscal 2020 to be approximately equal to or marginally less than our tax expense for the same period, subject to adjustment for certain timing differences. For additional information regarding our income taxes, see Note 23: Income Taxes in the Notes. Other than those cash outlays noted in the “Contractual Obligations” discussion below in this MD&A (including repayment at maturity of the entire $250 million of our Floating Rate Notes due April 30, 2020), capital expenditures, dividend payments, repurchases under our share repurchase program, L3Harris Merger-related transaction and integration costs and cash payments to counterparties upon termination of yield-based treasury lock agreements (see Note 20: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information regarding derivative instruments), we do not anticipate any significant cash outlays in fiscal 2020.

There can be no assurance, however, that our business will continue to generate cash flows at current levels or that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program or our credit facility or in the debt markets will not be impacted by any potential future credit and capital markets disruptions. If we are unable to maintain cash balances or generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our obligations, we may be required to sell assets, reduce capital expenditures, reduce or eliminate strategic acquisitions, reduce or terminate our share repurchases, reduce or eliminate dividends, refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing. Our ability to make principal payments or pay interest on or refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance and financial results, which, to a certain extent, are subject to general conditions in or affecting the defense, government and other markets we serve and to general economic, political, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors beyond our control.

Net cash provided by operating activities: The $470 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to the impact of higher income, including a $229 million pre-tax gain on sale of business, $182 million decrease in net cash used to fund working capital and $157 million more in share-based compensation, partially offset by $328 million more in qualified pension contributions, including a $302 million voluntary contribution, in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020. 

The $434 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the impact of higher income in fiscal 2019 and a $300 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plans in fiscal 2018, partially offset by higher cash paid for income taxes.

Refer to the Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K for discussion of the changes in net cash provided by operating changes during fiscal 2018.

Cash flow from operations was positive in all of our business segments in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities: The $1.4 billion increase in net cash provided by investing activities in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to $1.1 billion of net cash acquired in the L3Harris Merger and $343 million of net proceeds from the sale of the Harris Night Vision business, partially offset by a $106 million increase in cash used for additions of property, plant and equipment.

The $18 million increase in net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a $25 million increase in cash used for additions of property, plant and equipment.

Refer to the Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K for discussion of the changes in net cash used in investing activities from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018.

Net cash used in financing activities: The $1.6 billion increase in net cash used in financing activities in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 was primarily due to a $1.3 billion increase in cash used to repurchase our common stock, a $174 million increase in cash used to pay dividends, a $132 million increase in net cash used for net repayments of borrowings and a $66 million increase in cash used for tax withholding payments associated with vested share-based awards, partially offset by a $91 million increase in proceeds from exercises of employee stock options.

The $24 million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2019 compared with fiscal 2018 was primarily due to a $72 million decrease in cash used to repurchase our common stock, partially offset by a $53 million increase in cash used to pay dividends.

 50

Refer to the Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Strategies section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K for discussion of the changes in net cash used in financing activities from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018.

Funding of Pension Plans

Funding requirements under applicable laws and regulations are a major consideration in making contributions to our U.S. pension plans. Although we have significant discretion in making voluntary contributions, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and further amended by the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008, the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (“MAP-21”) and applicable Internal Revenue Code regulations mandate minimum funding thresholds. Failure to satisfy the minimum funding thresholds could result in restrictions on our ability to amend the plan or make benefit payments. With respect to our U.S. qualified pension plans, we intend to contribute annually not less than the required minimum funding thresholds. 

The Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2014 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 further extended the interest rate stabilization provision of MAP-21 until 2020. We made voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans of $302 million in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and $300 million and $400 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a result, we currently do not anticipate making any contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and we anticipate making only minor contributions to our non-U.S. pension plans during fiscal 2020.

Future required contributions primarily will depend on the actual annual return on assets and the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation at the end of each year. Depending on these factors, and the resulting funded status of our pension plans, the level of future statutory minimum contributions could be material. We had unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations of approximately $1.7 billion as of January 3, 2020 compared with approximately $1.2 billion as of June 28, 2019. This 42 percent increase in unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations was primarily due to the inclusion of L3’s defined benefit pension plans assumed in the L3Harris Merger. See Note 15: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in the Notes for further information regarding our defined benefit plans.

Common Stock Repurchases 

During the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, we used $1.5 billion to repurchase 7,356,168 shares of our common stock under our 2019 Repurchase Program at an average price per share of $203.92, including commissions of $.02 per share. During the two quarters ended December 28, 2018 (our first two quarters of fiscal 2019), we repurchased 1,219,750 shares of our common stock under our prior repurchase program for $200 million at an average price per share of $163.99, including commissions of $.02 per share. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our prior repurchase program during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2019. In the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, $86 million in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. In fiscal 2019, $24 million in shares of our common stock were delivered to us or withheld by us to satisfy withholding taxes on employee share-based awards. Shares repurchased by us are cancelled and retired. 

On July 1, 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved the 2019 Repurchase Program, a $4 billion share repurchase authorization that does not have a stated expiration date. The 2019 Repurchase Program replaced our prior share repurchase program, which had a remaining unused authorization of approximately $501 million, as well as L3’s prior share repurchase program. At January 3, 2020, we had a remaining, unused authorization of approximately $2.5 billion under our 2019 Repurchase Program. Repurchases under the 2019 Repurchase Program may be made through open-market transactions, private transactions, transactions structured through investment banking institutions or any combination thereof. The level of our repurchases depends on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our Board and management may deem relevant. The timing, volume and nature of repurchases are subject to market conditions, applicable securities laws and other factors and are at our discretion and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Additional information regarding our 2019 Repurchase Program is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Dividends

 51

On February 28, 2020, our Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on our common stock from $.75 per share to $.85 per share, for an annualized cash dividend rate of $3.40 per share, which was our nineteenth consecutive annual increase in our quarterly cash dividend rate. Our annualized cash dividend rate was $3.00 per share in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and $2.74 per share, $2.28 per share and $2.12 per share in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Quarterly cash dividends are typically paid in March, June, September and December. We currently expect that cash dividends will continue to be paid in the near future, but we can give no assurances concerning payment of future dividends or future dividend increases. The declaration of dividends and the amount thereof will depend on a number of factors, including our financial condition, capital requirements, cash flows, results of operations, future business prospects and other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. Additional information concerning our dividends is set forth above under “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” of this Report.

Capital Structure and Resources

2019 Credit Agreement: As discussed in Note 13: Credit Arrangements in the Notes, on June 28, 2019, we established a new $2 billion, 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2019 Credit Facility”) by entering into a Revolving Credit Agreement (the “2019 Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lenders. The 2019 Credit Facility replaced our prior $1 billion, 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2018 Credit Facility”). The description of the 2019 Credit Facility and the 2019 Credit Agreement set forth in Note 13: Credit Arrangements in the Notes is incorporated herein by reference.

We were in compliance with the covenants in the 2019 Credit Agreement at January 3, 2020, including the covenant requiring that we not permit our ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to total capital, each as defined in the 2019 Credit Agreement, to be greater than 0.65 to 1.00. At January 3, 2020, we had no borrowings outstanding under the 2019 Credit Arrangement.

Exchange Offer: In connection with the L3Harris Merger, on May 30, 2019, we commenced offers to eligible holders to exchange any and all outstanding 4.950% Senior Notes due 2021, 3.850% Senior Notes due 2023, 3.950% Senior Notes due 2024, 3.850% Senior Notes due 2026 and 4.400% Senior Notes due 2028 issued by L3 for up to $3.35 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes issued by L3Harris and cash. On July 2, 2019, we settled the debt exchange offer. See Note 14: Debt in the Notes for additional information.

Short-Term Debt: Our short-term debt at January 3, 2020, June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018 was $3 million, $103 million and $78 million, respectively, consisting of commercial paper and local borrowing by international subsidiaries for working capital needs. Our commercial paper program was supported by the 2019 Credit Facility at January 3, 2020 and June 28, 2019 and the 2018 Credit Facility at June 29, 2018. See Note 13: Credit Arrangements in the Notes for additional information regarding credit arrangements.

Long-Term Variable-Rate Debt: The description of our long-term variable-rate debt set forth in Note 14: Debt in the Notes is incorporated herein by reference. As discussed in Note 14: Debt in the Notes, during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we repaid at maturity the entire outstanding $300 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating Rate Notes due February 27, 2019 that had been issued in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we completed the issuance and sale of $250 million in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due April 30, 2020 and used the net proceeds, together with cash on hand, to repay in full the $253 million in remaining outstanding indebtedness under the 5-year tranche of our $1.3 billion senior unsecured term loan facility pursuant to our Term Loan Agreement, dated as of March 16, 2015. We repaid the entire $305 million in remaining outstanding indebtedness under our variable-rate term loans during fiscal 2018.

Long-Term Fixed-Rate Debt: The description of our long-term fixed-rate debt set forth in Note 14: Debt in the Notes is incorporated herein by reference. As discussed in Note 14: Debt in the Notes, on November 27, 2019, in order to fund our optional redemption of our 2.7% Notes due April 27, 2020 (the “2.7% 2020 Notes”), we completed the issuance and sale of $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.900% Notes due December 15, 2029. On December 16, 2019, we completed our optional redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.7% 2020 Notes at a “make-whole” redemption price of $403 million, as set forth in the 2.7% 2020 Notes. The 2.7% 2020 Notes were terminated and cancelled. On June 4, 2018, in order to fund our optional redemption of the 2018 Redeemed Notes described below, we completed the issuance and sale of $850 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.400% Notes due June 15, 2028. On June 22, 2018, we completed our optional redemption of the entire outstanding $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.4% Notes due December 15, 2020 (the “4.4% 2020 Notes”) and $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.55% Notes due October 1, 2021 (the “5.55% 2021 Notes” and collectively with the 4.4% 2020 Notes, the “2018 Redeemed Notes”) at a “make-whole” redemption price as set forth in the 4.4% 2020 Notes and the 5.55% 2021 Notes, respectively. The combined “make-whole” redemption price for the 2018 Redeemed Notes was $844 million. The 2018 Redeemed Notes were terminated and cancelled. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we also repaid at maturity the entire outstanding $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 1.999% Notes due April 27, 2018.

During fiscal 2017, we repaid at maturity the entire outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of our 4.25% Notes due October 1, 2016.

Other Agreements: We have a receivable sales agreement (“RSA”) with a third-party financial institution that permits us to sell, on a non-recourse basis, up to $100 million of outstanding receivables at any given time. From time to time, we have sold certain customer receivables under the RSA, which we continue to service and collect on behalf of the third-party financial institution and which we account for as sales of receivables with sale proceeds included in net cash from operating activities. The impact to net cash from operating activities from these transactions was not material in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 or fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.

 52

Contractual Obligations

At January 3, 2020, we had contractual cash obligations to repay debt, to purchase goods and services and to make payments under operating leases. Payments due under these long-term obligations are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

_______________

(1)The purchase obligations of $3.4 billion included $568 million of purchase obligations related to cost-plus type contracts where our costs are fully reimbursable.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(3)The above table does not include unrecognized tax benefits of $438 million.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In accordance with the definition under SEC rules, any of the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:

•Any obligation under certain guarantee contracts;

•A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets;

•Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, under certain derivative instruments; and

•Any obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to, the registrant, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging or R&D services with the registrant.

As of January 3, 2020, we were not participating in any material transactions that generated relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including variable interest entities, and we did not have any material retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above. As of January 3, 2020, we did not have material financial guarantees or other contractual commitments that are reasonably likely to adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, and we were not a party to any related party transactions that materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We have, from time to time, divested certain of our businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities, such as environmental liabilities and tax liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. We do not believe, however, that the liabilities relating to these representations, warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Due to our downsizing of certain operations pursuant to acquisitions, divestitures, restructuring plans or otherwise, certain properties leased by us have been sublet to third parties. If any of these third parties vacates any of these premises, we would be legally obligated under master lease arrangements. We believe that the financial risk of default by such sublessees is individually and in the aggregate not material to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

 53

Commercial Commitments

We have entered into commercial commitments in the normal course of business including surety bonds, standby letter of credit agreements and other arrangements with financial institutions and customers primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts to provide products and services to customers or to obtain insurance policies with our insurance carriers. At January 3, 2020, we had commercial commitments on outstanding surety bonds, standby letters of credit and other arrangements, as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The surety bonds and standby letters of credit used for performance are primarily related to Public Safety and Professional Communications. As is customary in bidding for and completing network infrastructure projects for public safety systems, contractors are required to procure surety bonds and/or standby letters of credit for bids, performance, warranty and other purposes (collectively, “Performance Bonds”). Such Performance Bonds normally have maturities of up to three years and are standard in the industry as a way to provide customers a mechanism to seek redress if a contractor does not satisfy performance requirements under a contract. Typically, a customer is permitted to draw on a Performance Bond if we do not fulfill all terms of a project contract. In such an event, we would be obligated to reimburse the financial institution that issued the Performance Bond for the amounts paid. It has been rare for our Public Safety and Professional Communications business to have a Performance Bond drawn upon. In addition, pursuant to the terms under which we procure Performance Bonds, if our credit ratings are lowered to below “investment grade,” we may be required to provide collateral to support a portion of the outstanding amount of Performance Bonds. Such a downgrade could increase the cost of the issuance of Performance Bonds and could make it more difficult to procure Performance Bonds, which would adversely impact our ability to compete for contract awards. Such collateral requirements could also result in less liquidity for other operational needs or corporate purposes. In addition, any future disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in financial and insurance markets could also adversely affect our ability to obtain Performance Bonds and may result in higher funding costs.

Financial Risk Management

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates. We employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks.

Foreign Exchange and Currency: Our U.S. and foreign businesses enter into contracts with customers, subcontractors or vendors that are denominated in currencies other than functional currencies of such businesses. We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to hedge both balance sheet and off-balance sheet future foreign currency commitments. Factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs for foreign currency include accuracy of sales estimates, volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments. A 10 percent change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at January 3, 2020 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of such instruments or our results of operations or cash flows. This quantification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign currency financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair value of our foreign denominated assets, liabilities and firm commitments. See Note 20: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information.

Interest Rates: As of January 3, 2020, we had long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. The fair value of these obligations is impacted by changes in interest rates; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations at January 3, 2020 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of these obligations. There is no interest-rate risk associated with long-term fixed-rate debt obligations on our results of operations and cash flows unless existing obligations are refinanced upon maturity at then-current interest rates, because the interest rates are fixed until maturity, and because our long-term fixed-rate debt is not putable to us (i.e., not required to be redeemed by us prior to maturity). We can give no assurances, 

 54

however, that interest rates will not change significantly or have a material effect on the fair value of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations over the next twelve months. See Note 14: Debt in the Notes for information regarding the maturities of our long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. 

We use derivative instruments from time to time to manage our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our anticipated issuance of new long-term fixed-rate notes to repay at maturity our existing long-term fixed-rate debt obligations. If the derivative instrument is designated as a cash flow hedge, gains and losses from changes in the fair value of such instrument are deferred and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to interest expense in the period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings. See Note 20: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information.

At January 3, 2020, we had two outstanding treasury lock agreements, with a notional amount of $650 million, to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the benchmark interest rate (10-year U.S. Treasury rate) associated with our anticipated issuance of long-term fixed-rate notes to redeem or repay at maturity the entire $650 million outstanding principal amount of the 4.95% Notes due February 15, 2021 (“4.95% 2021 Notes”). We designated these treasury locks as cash flow hedges against fluctuations in interest payments on the 4.95% 2021 Notes due to changes in the benchmark interest rate prior to issuance, which we expect to occur before the date of maturity of the 4.95% 2021 Notes. An unrealized after-tax loss of $16 million associated with these treasury locks was deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss at January 3, 2020. A 10 percent change in the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate at September 27, 2019 would not have had a material impact on the fair value of these treasury lock agreements or our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 20: Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities in the Notes for additional information.

As of January 3, 2020, we also had long-term variable-rate debt obligations of $250 million of Floating Rate Notes due April 30, 2020. These debt obligations bear interest that is variable based on certain short-term indices, thus exposing us to interest-rate risk; however, a 10 percent change in interest rates for these debt obligations at January 3, 2020 would not have had a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows. See Note 14: Debt in the Notes for further information.

We have also used short-term variable-rate debt borrowings, primarily under our commercial paper program, which are subject to interest rate risk. We utilize our commercial paper program to satisfy short-term cash requirements, including bridge financing for strategic acquisitions until longer-term financing arrangements are put in place, temporarily funding repurchases under our share repurchase programs and temporarily funding redemption of long-term debt. The interest rate risk associated with such debt on our results of operations and cash flows is not material due to its temporary nature.

Impact of Foreign Exchange

Approximately 40 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency environments in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 compared with 18 percent in fiscal 2019 and 22 percent in fiscal 2018. The impact of translating the assets and liabilities of these operations to U.S. Dollars is included as a component of shareholders’ equity. As of January 3, 2020, the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment included in shareholders’ equity was a $81 million loss compared with a $106 million loss at June 28, 2019 and $99 million loss at June 29, 2018. We utilize foreign currency hedging instruments to minimize the currency risk of international transactions. Gains and losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations did not have a material effect on our results in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 or fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.

Impact of Inflation

To the extent feasible, we have consistently followed the practice of adjusting our prices to reflect the impact of inflation on salaries and fringe benefits for employees and the cost of purchased materials and services. Inflation and changing prices did not materially adversely impact our gross margin, revenue or operating income in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 or fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies or estimates. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes. In preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances, we apply our accounting policies and estimates as disclosed in the Notes. We consider the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment, with financial reporting results dependent on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Specific risks for these critical accounting estimates are described in the following paragraphs. The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed throughout this MD&A where such estimates affect our reported and expected financial results. Senior management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates and the related disclosure included herein with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Preparation of this Report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and backlog as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

 55

Besides estimates that meet the “critical” accounting estimate criteria, we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures. All estimates, whether or not deemed “critical,” affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are based on experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known, including for estimates that we do not deem “critical.”

Revenue Recognition

A significant portion of our business is derived from development and production contracts. Revenue and profit related to development and production contracts are generally recognized over time, typically using the percentage of completion (“POC”) cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, whereby we measure our progress toward completion of performance obligations based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs at completion under the contract. Because costs incurred represent work performed, we believe this method best depicts the transfer of control to the customer. Under the POC cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition, a single estimated profit margin is used to recognize profit for each performance obligation over its period of performance. Recognition of profit on a contract requires estimates of the total cost at completion and transaction price as well as measurement of progress towards completion. Due to the long-term nature of many of our contracts, developing the estimated total cost at completion and total transaction price often requires judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the cost of the work to be completed include: the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, subcontractor performance and the risk and impact of delayed performance. Factors that must be considered in estimating the total transaction price include contractual cost or performance incentives (such as incentive fees, award fees and penalties) and other forms of variable consideration as well as our historical experience and expectation for performance on the contract. These variable amounts generally are awarded upon achievement of certain negotiated performance metrics, program milestones or cost targets and can be based upon customer discretion. We include such estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved.

At the outset of each contract, we gauge its complexity and perceived risks and establish an estimated total cost at completion in line with these expectations. After establishing the estimated total cost at completion, we follow a standard Estimate at Completion (“EAC”) process in which we review the progress and performance on our ongoing contracts at least quarterly and, in many cases, more frequently. If we successfully retire risks associated with the technical, schedule and cost aspects of a contract, we may lower our estimated total cost at completion commensurate with the retirement of these risks. Conversely, if we are not successful in retiring these risks, we may increase our estimated total cost at completion. Additionally, as the contract progresses, our estimates of total transaction price may increase or decrease if, for example, we receive award fees that are higher or lower than expected. When adjustments in estimated total costs at completion or in estimated total transaction price are determined, the related impact on operating income is recognized using the cumulative catch-up method, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of such adjustments for all prior periods. Any anticipated losses on these contracts are fully recognized in the period in which the losses become evident.

EAC adjustments had the following impacts to operating income for the periods presented:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

There were no individual impacts to operating income due to EAC adjustments in the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 or in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017 that were material to our results of operations on a consolidated or segment basis for such periods.

We recognize revenue from numerous contracts with multiple performance obligations. For these contracts, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price of the good or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount for which we would sell the good or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not sold as bundled sale with any other products or services). The allocation of transaction price among separate performance obligations may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract. 

A substantial majority of our revenue is derived from contracts with the U.S. Government, including foreign military sales contracts. These contracts are subject to the FAR and the prices of our contract deliverables are typically based on our estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result, the standalone selling prices of the goods and services in these 

 56

contracts are typically equal to the selling prices stated in the contract, thereby eliminating the need to allocate (or reallocate) the transaction price to the multiple performance obligations. In our non-U.S. Government contracts, when standalone selling prices are not directly observable, we also generally use the expected cost plus a margin approach to determine standalone selling price. In determining the appropriate margin under the cost plus margin approach, we consider historical margins on similar products sold to similar customers or within similar geographies where objective evidence is available. We may also consider our cost structure and profit objectives, the nature of the proposal, the effects of customization of pricing, our practices used to establish pricing of bundled products, the expected technological life of the product, margins earned on similar contracts with different customers and other factors to determine the appropriate margin. 

Postretirement Benefit Plans

Certain of our current and former employees participate in defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, referred to as “defined benefit plans”) in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Germany, which are sponsored by L3Harris. The determination of projected benefit obligations and the recognition of expenses related to defined benefit pension plans are dependent on various assumptions. These major assumptions primarily relate to discount rates, long-term expected rates of return on plan assets, rate of future compensation increases, mortality, termination and other factors (some of which are disclosed in Note 15: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in the Notes). Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and generally amortized for each plan to the extent required over the estimated future life expectancy or, if applicable, the future working lifetime of the plan’s active participants. 

As part of our accounting for the L3Harris Merger, we completed a valuation and re-measurement of all L3 pension and other postretirement benefit (“OPEB”) plans as of the June 29, 2019 closing date of the L3Harris Merger and we recorded a $233 million increase to L3’s pension and OPEB liability as of June 29, 2019 based on the results of this valuation. The total L3 pension and OPEB liability assumed by L3Harris was $1.4 billion at June 29, 2019. The discount rate assumption used was a yield curve rather than a single interest rate. For the pension plans, the average June 29, 2019 discount rate used was 3.54 percent for U.S. plans and 2.95 percent for Canadian plans. For OPEB plans, the average June 29, 2019 discount rate used was 3.31 percent for U.S. plans and 2.92 percent for Canadian plans. The long‐term expected rate of return on plan assets for the Fiscal Transition Period was 7.75 percent for the majority of our postretirement benefit plans.

Significant Assumptions 

We develop assumptions using relevant experience, in conjunction with market-related data for each plan. Assumptions are reviewed annually with third party consultants and adjusted as appropriate. The table included below provides the weighted average assumptions used to estimate projected benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost as they pertain to our defined benefit pension plans.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Key assumptions for the U.S. Salaried Retirement Plan (“U.S. SRP”) (our largest defined benefit plan, with approximately 54% of the total projected benefit obligation as of January 3, 2020) included a discount rate for obligation assumptions of 3.10% and expected return on plan assets of 7.75% for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, which is being maintained at 7.75% for fiscal 2020. Effective December 31, 2016, accruals under the U.S. SRP benefit formula were frozen for all employees and replaced with a 1% cash balance benefit formula for certain employees who were not highly compensated on December 31, 2016. 

Expected Return on Plan Assets

Substantially all of our plan assets are managed on a commingled basis in a master investment trust. We determine our expected return on plan assets by evaluating both historical returns and estimates of future returns. Specifically, we consider the plan’s actual historical annual return on assets over the past 15, 20 and 25 years and historical broad market returns over long-term time frames based on our strategic allocation, which is detailed in Note 15: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in the Notes. Future returns are based on independent estimates of long-term asset class returns. Based on this approach, the long-term annual rate of return on assets was estimated at 7.68% for the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 and fiscal 2020. 

 57

Discount Rate

The discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future benefit payments at the measurement date. A decrease in the discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and generally decreases pension expense. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The pension discount rate is determined by considering an interest rate yield curve comprising AAA/AA bonds, with maturities between zero and thirty years, developed by the plan’s actuaries. Annual benefit payments are then discounted to present value using this yield curve to develop a single discount rate matching the plan’s characteristics. 

Sensitivity Analysis

Pension Expense

A 25 basis point change in the long-term expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate would have the following effect on the combined U.S. defined benefit pension plans’ pension expense for the next twelve months:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Projected Benefit Obligation

Funded status is derived by subtracting the respective year-end values of the projected benefit obligations (“PBO”) from the fair value of plan assets. The sensitivity of the PBO to changes in the discount rate varies depending on the magnitude and direction of the change in the discount rate. We estimate that a decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate of the combined U.S. defined benefit pension plans would increase the PBO by approximately $288.7 million and an increase of 25 basis points would decrease the PBO by approximately $274.7 million.

Fair Value of Plan Assets

The plan assets of our defined benefit plans comprise a broad range of investments, including domestic and international equity securities, fixed income investments, interests in private equity and hedge funds and cash and cash equivalents.

A portion of our defined benefit plans asset portfolio is comprised of investments in private equity and hedge funds. The private equity and hedge fund investments are generally measured using the valuation of the underlying investments or at net asset value. However, in certain instances, the values reported by the asset managers were not current at the measurement date. Consequently, we have estimated adjustments to the last reported value where necessary to measure the assets at fair value at the measurement date. These adjustments consider information received from the asset managers, as well as general market information. Asset values for other positions were generally measured using market observable prices. See Note 15: Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits in the Notes for further information.

Goodwill

Goodwill in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2020 and June 28, 2019 was $20.0 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively. Goodwill is not amortized. We perform annual (or under certain circumstances, more frequent) impairment tests of our goodwill. We identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying amount, including goodwill, which is adjusted for allocations of Corporate assets and liabilities as appropriate. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. 

L3Harris Merger Goodwill Allocation 

As discussed in more detail in Note 25: Business Segments in the Notes, after the completion of the L3Harris Merger, we adjusted our segment reporting to reflect our new organizational structure effective June 29, 2019. Because our accounting for the L3Harris Merger is still preliminary, we assigned goodwill acquired on a provisional basis. Immediately before and after our goodwill assignments, we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment under our former and new segment reporting structure and determined that no impairment existed. See Note 5: Business Combination and Note 10: Goodwill in the Notes for additional information. 

Harris Night Vision Goodwill Allocation 

As described in more detail in Note 3: Divestitures, Asset Sales and Discontinued Operations in the Notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Harris Night Vision business on April 4, 2019 and completed the sale on September 13, 2019. Because the then pending divestiture of the Harris Night Vision business represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our former Communication System segment, we assigned $30 million of goodwill to the Harris Night Vision business

disposal group on a relative fair value basis during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, when the held for sale criteria were met. The fair value of the Harris Night Vision business disposal group was determined based on the negotiated selling price, and the fair value of the retained businesses (which comprised the remaining portion of the reporting unit) was determined based on a combination of market-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices and comparable publicly reported transactions, and projected discounted cash flows. These fair value determinations are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. In conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses for impairment, and we concluded that goodwill and other assets related to the Harris Night Vision business were not impaired as of June 28, 2019.

IT Services Goodwill Allocation and Impairment

As described in more detail in Note 3: Divestitures, Asset Sales and Discontinued Operations in the Notes, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell IT Services on January 26, 2017 and completed the sale on April 28, 2017. Because the then-pending divestiture of IT Services represented the disposal of a portion of a reporting unit within our former Critical Networks segment, we assigned $487 million of goodwill to the IT Services disposal group on a relative fair value basis during the third quarter of fiscal 2017, when the held for sale criteria were met. The fair value of the IT Services disposal group was determined based on the negotiated selling price, and the fair value of the retained businesses (which comprised the remaining portion of the reporting unit) was determined based on a combination of market-based valuation techniques, utilizing quoted market prices and comparable publicly reported transactions, and projected discounted cash flows. These fair value determinations are categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy due to their use of internal projections and unobservable measurement inputs. In conjunction with the relative fair value allocation, we tested goodwill assigned to the disposal group and goodwill assigned to the retained businesses for impairment. As a result, we concluded, in connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, that goodwill and other assets related to IT Services were impaired as of March 31, 2017, and we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $240 million in discontinued operations, $228 million of which related to goodwill. The goodwill impairment charge was non-deductible for tax purposes. 

Fiscal 2017, 2018 and 2019 and Fiscal Transition Period Impairment Tests

We perform an annual impairment test of our goodwill as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist. Following our fiscal year end change, we made a corresponding change to our annual impairment assessment date and will continue to perform annual impairment test on the first day of our fourth quarter, which for the Fiscal Transition Period was September 28, 2019 (the first day of the last quarter of the Fiscal Transition Period). 

We test goodwill for impairment at a level within the Company referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or one level below the business segment. Some of our segments are comprised of several reporting units. Allocation of goodwill to several reporting units could make it more likely that we will have an impairment charge in the future. An impairment charge to one of our reporting units could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment. To test goodwill for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. If we elect to perform a qualitative assessment for a certain reporting unit, we evaluate events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the probability that goodwill is impaired. If we determine it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative assessment. 

Our qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill, whether performed annually or based on specific events or circumstances, considers various macroeconomic, industry-specific and company-specific factors. These factors include: (i) deterioration in the general economy; (ii) deterioration in the environment in which the company operates; (iii) increase in raw materials, labor or other costs; (iv) negative or declining cash flows; (v) changes in management, changes in strategy, or significant litigation; (vi) change in the composition or carrying amount of net assets or an expectation of disposing all or a portion of the reporting unit; or (vii) a sustained decrease in share price. 

If we perform a quantitative assessment for a certain reporting unit, we calculate the fair value of that reporting unit and compare the fair value to the reporting unit’s net book value. We estimate fair values of our reporting units based on projected cash flows, and sales and/or earnings multiples applied to the latest twelve months’ sales and earnings of our reporting units. Projected cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and balance sheet metrics reflecting our view of the financial and market conditions of the underlying business; and the resulting cash flows are discounted using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk in the forecasted cash flows. The sales and earnings multiples applied to the sales and earnings of our reporting units are based on current multiples of sales and earnings for similar businesses, and based on sales and earnings multiples paid for recent acquisitions of similar businesses made in the marketplace. We then assess whether any implied control premium, based on a comparison of fair value based purely on our stock price and outstanding shares with fair value determined by using all of the above-described models, is reasonable.

We tested goodwill for impairment as of September 28, 2019 and the estimated fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount.

Accounting for Business Combinations

We follow the acquisition method of accounting to record identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree recognized in connection with acquired businesses at their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition.

Intangible assets from business combinations are recognized at their estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition and generally consist of customer relationships, trade names, developed technology and in-process R&D (“IPR&D”). Determination of the estimated fair value of intangible assets requires judgment. The fair value of customer contractual relationships is determined based on estimates and judgments regarding future after-tax earnings and cash flows arising from follow-on sales on contract renewals expected from customer contractual relationships over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and sales, less a contributory asset charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of trade name intangible assets is determined utilizing the relief from royalty method. Under this form of the income approach, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the trade name and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their useful lives, generally ranging from three to twenty years. The preliminary estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in connection with the L3Harris Merger was approximately $7.9 billion. 

We assess the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. We evaluate the recoverability of such assets based on the expectations of undiscounted cash flows of the assets. If the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset, a loss would be recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount. See Note 5: Business Combination and Note 11: Intangible Assets for additional information. 

Income Taxes 

We record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We follow very specific and detailed guidelines in each tax jurisdiction regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide necessary valuation allowances as required. Future realization of deferred tax assets ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character (for example, ordinary income or capital gain) within the carryback or carryforward periods available under the tax law. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. We have not made any material changes in the methodologies used to determine our tax valuation allowances during the two quarters ended January 3, 2020 or the previous three fiscal years.

Our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 3, 2020 included deferred tax assets of $102 million and deferred tax liabilities of $1.48 billion. This compares with deferred tax assets of $173 million and deferred tax liabilities of $12 million as of June 28, 2019 and deferred tax assets of $119 million and deferred tax liabilities of $79 million as of June 29, 2018. For all jurisdictions for which we have net deferred tax assets, we expect that our existing levels of pre-tax earnings are sufficient to generate the amount of future taxable income needed to realize these tax assets. Our valuation allowance related to deferred income taxes, which is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, was $185 million as of January 3, 2020 compared with $159 million as of June 28, 2019 and $181 million as of June 29, 2018. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our deferred tax assets, if we continue to operate at a loss in certain jurisdictions or are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the potential impact of tax planning strategies changes, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results.

The evaluation of tax positions taken in a filed tax return, or planned to be taken in a future tax return or claim, involves inherent uncertainty and requires the use of judgment. We evaluate our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based on our assessment of the facts and circumstances as of the reporting date. For tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we record the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50 percent probability of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the applicable taxing authority, assuming the taxing authority has full knowledge of all relevant information. For income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be realized, we do not recognize a tax benefit in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of January 3, 2020, we had $438 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $313 million would favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized. As of June 28, 2019, we had $204 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $162 million would favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are 

 60

eventually recognized. As of June 29, 2018, we had $102 million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $92 million would favorably impact our future tax rates in the event that the tax benefits are eventually recognized. 

It is reasonably possible that there could be a significant decrease or increase to our unrecognized tax benefits during the course of the next twelve months as ongoing tax examinations continue, other tax examinations commence or various statutes of limitations expire. However, an estimate of the range of possible changes cannot be made for remaining unrecognized tax benefits because of the significant number of jurisdictions in which we do business and the number of open tax periods. See Note 23: Income Taxes for additional information. 

Impact of Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued but have not yet been implemented by us are described in Note 2: Accounting Changes or Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the Notes, which describes the potential impact that these pronouncements are expected to have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

The following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from our historical results or our current expectations or projections. Other factors besides those listed here also could adversely affect us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Report for more information regarding factors that might cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in this Report.

•We depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•We depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•The U.S. Government’s budget deficit and the national debt, as well as any inability of the U.S. Government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year and consequently having to shut down or operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a “continuing resolution,” could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•We could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion, insider threats or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.

•Our ability to successfully manage ongoing business and organizational changes could impact our business results.

•Our results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts. In particular, our fixed-price contracts could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.

•We use estimates in accounting for many of our programs, and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.

•We derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.

•The level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods.

•We may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.

•Disputes with our subcontractors or the inability of our subcontractors to perform, or our key suppliers to timely deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our products, systems or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.

•Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.

•Our future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.

•We participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.

•We cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.

•Strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

 61

•The outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved from time to time is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•We are subject to government investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future prospects.

•Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.

•Our commercial aviation products, systems and services business is affected by global demand and economic factors that could negatively impact our financial results.

•We face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.

•Changes in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

•Our level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our unfunded defined benefit plans liability may adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.

•A downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.

•Unforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

•We have significant operations in locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.

•Changes in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would adversely affect our results of operations.

•We must attract and retain key employees, and any failure to do so could seriously harm us.

•Some of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.

•We may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the businesses.

•Certain business uncertainties arising from the L3Harris Merger could adversely affect our businesses and operations.

•We have incurred and will incur direct and indirect costs as a result of the L3Harris Merger.
