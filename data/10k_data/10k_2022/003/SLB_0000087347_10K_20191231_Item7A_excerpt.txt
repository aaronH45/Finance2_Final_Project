Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  

As a multinational company, Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries. Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar. Approximately 78% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2019 was denominated in US dollars. However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies. Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase.  

Schlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings. Schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities, and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. 

A 10% appreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2019 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $8 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2019 market rates would increase the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $9 million. In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings.

At December 31, 2019, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $7.7 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $3.0 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  

Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio. Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2019, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt aggregating approximately $12.9 billion and variable rate debt aggregating approximately $2.4 billion, before considering the effects of cross currency swaps.  

Schlumberger’s exposure to interest rate risk associated with its debt is also partially mitigated by its investment portfolio. Short-term investments, which totaled approximately $1.0 billion at December 31, 2019, are comprised primarily of money market funds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds and notes, substantially all of which are denominated in US dollars. The average return on investments was 3.0% in 2019.  

The following table reflects the carrying amounts of Schlumberger’s debt at December 31, 2019 by year of maturity:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The fair market value of the outstanding fixed rate debt was approximately $13.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The weighted average interest rate on the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2019 was 2.3%.  

Schlumberger does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
