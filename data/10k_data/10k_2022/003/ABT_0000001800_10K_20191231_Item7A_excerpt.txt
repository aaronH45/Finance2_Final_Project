ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Financial Instruments and Risk Management

Market Price Sensitive Investments

The fair value of equity securities held by Abbott with a readily determinable fair value was approximately $11 million and $13 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These equity securities are subject to potential changes in fair value. A hypothetical 20 percent decrease in the share prices of these investments would decrease their fair value at December 31, 2019 by approximately $2 million. Changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded in earnings. The fair value of investments in mutual funds that are held in a rabbi trust for the purpose of paying benefits under a deferred compensation plan was approximately $346 million and $307 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Changes in the fair value of these investments, as well as an offsetting change in the benefit obligation, are recorded in earnings.

Non-Publicly Traded Equity Securities

Abbott holds equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges. The carrying value of these investments was $158 million and $211 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. No individual investment is recorded at a value in excess of $61 million. Abbott measures these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.

Interest Rate Sensitive Financial Instruments

At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott had interest rate hedge contracts totaling $2.9 billion to manage its exposure to changes in the fair value of debt. The effect of these hedges is to change the fixed interest rate to a variable rate for the portion of the debt that is hedged. Abbott does not use derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates for its investment securities. The fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2019 and 2018 amounted to $20.8 billion and $19.9 billion, respectively (average interest rates of 3.3% and 3.5% as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively) with maturities through 2046. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the fair value of current and long-term investment securities amounted to approximately $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 100-basis point change in the interest rates would not have a material effect on cash flows, income or fair values. (A 100-basis point change is believed to be a reasonably possible near-term change in rates.)

Foreign Currency Sensitive Financial Instruments

Certain Abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the U.S. dollar. These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and are marked-to-market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses will be included in Cost of products sold at the time the products are sold, generally within the next twelve to eighteen months. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott held $6.8 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, of such contracts. Contracts held at December 31, 2019 will mature in 2020 or 2021 depending upon the contract. Contracts held at December 31, 2018 matured in 2019 or will mature in 2020 depending upon the contract.

Abbott enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency denominated intercompany loans and trade payables and third-party trade payables and receivables. The contracts are marked-to-market, and resulting gains or losses are reflected in income and are generally offset by losses or gains on the foreign currency exposure being managed. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, Abbott held $9.1 billion and $13.6 billion, respectively, of such contracts, which mature in the next 13 months.

In November 2019, Abbott borrowed ¥59.8 billion under a 5-year term loan and designated the yen-denominated loan as a hedge of the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. From the date of the borrowing through December 31, 2019, the value of this long-term debt decreased approximately $4 million to $546 million due to foreign exchange rate changes. The change in the value was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. In March 2017, Abbott repaid its $479 million yen-denominated short-term debt which was designated as a hedge of the net

investment in a foreign subsidiary. At December 31, 2016, the value of this short-term debt was $454 million, and changes in the fair value of the debt up through the date of repayment due to changes in exchange rates were recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.
