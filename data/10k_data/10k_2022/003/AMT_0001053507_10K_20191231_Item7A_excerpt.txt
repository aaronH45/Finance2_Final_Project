Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2019, we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of $18.3 million, has an interest rate of 5.37% and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $600.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. In addition, we have three interest rate swap agreements related to a portion of the 3.000% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of $500.0 million, an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in June 2023.

 Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of December 31, 2019 consisted of $700.0 million under the 2019 Multicurrency Credit Facility, $1.6 billion under the 2019 Credit Facility, $1.0 billion under the 2019 Term Loan, $1.0 billion under the 2019 364-Day Term Loan, $600.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes, $500.0 million under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 3.000% Notes, $20.8 million under the South African credit facility, $6.1 million under the Colombian credit facility after giving effect to our interest rate swap agreements, $16.3 million under the Brazil credit facility and $329.8 million under the Eaton Towers Debt. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional $20.8 million of interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Foreign Currency Risk

We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 43% of our revenues and 51% of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies.

As of December 31, 2019, we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested, and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in $105.4 million of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019.
