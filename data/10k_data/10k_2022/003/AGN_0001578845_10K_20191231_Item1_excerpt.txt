BUSINESS 

Explanatory Note 

This Annual Report on Form 10-K is a combined annual report being filed separately by two registrants: Allergan plc and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, Warner Chilcott Limited. Each registrant hereto is filing on its own behalf all the information contained in this annual report that relates to such registrant. Each registrant hereto is not filing any information that does not relate to such registrant, and therefore makes no representations as to any such information. 

Company History 

Allergan plc was incorporated in Ireland on May 16, 2013 as a private limited company and re-registered effective September 20, 2013 as a public limited company. Except where otherwise indicated, and excluding certain insignificant cash and non-cash transactions at the Allergan plc level, the consolidated financial statements and disclosures are for two separate registrants, Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. The results of Warner Chilcott Limited are consolidated into the results of Allergan plc. Due to the de minimis activity between Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited, references throughout this document relate to both Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited. Refer to “Note 3 —Reconciliation of Warner Chilcott Limited results to Allergan plc results” in the accompanying “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in this document for a summary of the details on the differences between Allergan plc and Warner Chilcott Limited.

On June 25, 2019, the Company announced that it entered into a transaction agreement (the “AbbVie Agreement”) under which AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”), a global, research-driven biopharmaceutical company, would acquire Allergan plc in a stock and cash transaction (the “AbbVie Transaction”), valued at $188.24 per Allergan share, or approximately $63.0 billion, based on AbbVie’s then-current stock price at the time the AbbVie Transaction was announced. At the closing of the proposed AbbVie Transaction, Company shareholders will receive 0.8660 shares of AbbVie common stock and $120.30 in cash for each of their existing shares. On October 14, 2019, the Company’s shareholders voted to approve the AbbVie Transaction. The AbbVie Transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  

On October 25, 2019, in connection with the AbbVie Transaction, AbbVie commenced offers to exchange all Allergan Senior Notes issued by Allergan and maturing from September 15, 2020 through March 15, 2045 for up to approximately $19.6 billion aggregate principal amount of new notes to be issued by AbbVie and cash. In conjunction with the exchange offer, AbbVie solicited and obtained consents from eligible holders of the Allergan Senior Notes to amend each of the indentures governing the Allergan Senior Notes to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants in such indentures and eliminate any guarantees of the related Allergan Senior Notes. Consummation of the exchange offer is conditioned upon, among other things, the closing of the AbbVie Transaction. The exchange offers are expected to close, and such amendments are expected to become operative, on or about the closing date of the AbbVie Transaction. 

On January 27, 2020, in connection with the AbbVie Transaction, Allergan announced that it entered into definitive agreements to divest (a) brazikumab, an IL-23 inhibitor currently being evaluated in a phase IIb/III study as a potential treatment for Crohn’s Disease and in a phase II study for ulcerative colitis, and (b) Zenpep®, a product approved for treating exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis and other conditions, and Viokace®, another pancreatic enzyme preparation. These agreements were made in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process for the AbbVie Transaction. AstraZeneca plc will acquire brazikumab, including global development and commercial rights. Nestle SA will acquire Zenpep® and Viokace®. The closing of the divestiture of brazikumab is contingent upon receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Commission approval, the closing of the divestitures of Zenpep® and Viokace® is contingent upon receipt of of U.S. Federal Trade Commission approval, and closings of both divestitures are contingent upon the closing of the AbbVie Transaction and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.

The Company concluded based on the stage of development of the assets, the lack of acquired employees and manufacturing, as well as the lack of certain other inputs and processes, that the transaction did not qualify as a business. The aggregate upfront payment of $145.0 million was recorded as a component of R&D expense in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Business Description  

The Company markets brand pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including aesthetic products, under brand names through programs that are designed to generate physician and consumer loyalty. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company changed the operational and management structure for its in-development calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) receptors, Ubrogepant and Atogepant. These development products were previously reported within the US Specialized Therapeutics segment and have been transferred to the US General Medicine segment to align these development products with the Company’s management structure and reporting. The revenues and cost of sales related to these products in prior periods were zero and any selling and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses were de minimis, and therefore it was not necessary to recast prior periods.  

As a result of the differences between the types of products we market and/or distribute, we operate and manage our business in three distinct operating segments: US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International. The operating segments are organized as follows: 

•  

The US Specialized Therapeutics segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the U.S., including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology through September 20, 2018, Eye Care and Neuroscience and Urology therapeutic products. 

•  

The US General Medicine segment includes sales and expenses relating to branded products within the U.S. that do not fall into the US Specialized Therapeutics business units, including Central Nervous System, Gastrointestinal, Women’s Health, Anti-Infectives and Diversified Brands. 

•  

The International segment includes sales and expenses relating to products sold outside the U.S. 

Business Strategy 

We apply four key strategies to achieve growth for our US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International businesses: (i) internal development of differentiated and high-demand products, (ii) investing behind key marketed brands, (iii) establishment of strategic alliances and collaborations and (iv) acquisition of products and companies that complement our current business.  

Based upon business conditions, our financial strength and other factors, we regularly reexamine our business strategies and may change them at any time. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS —Risks Related to Our Business” in this document.

As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio of products within the US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International segments include the following products with sales in excess of $200.0 million: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our portfolio of products also includes eye drops, including Optive and Refresh, with net sales in excess of $200.0 million in 2019. 

On December 23, 2019, the Company received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the Company’s New Drug Application (NDA) for UBRELVY™ (ubrogepant) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura in adults. UBRELVY™ is a first-in-class oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (“CGRP”) receptor antagonist (gepant) for the treatment of migraine attacks once they start. 

On January 27, 2020, in connection with the AbbVie Transaction, Allergan announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to divest Zenpep® and Viokace®. This agreement was made in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process for the AbbVie Transaction. The closing of the divestitures of Zenpep® and Viokace® are contingent upon receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission approval, closing of the AbbVie Transaction and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. 

Businesses 

Our US Specialized Therapeutics business offers certain of our branded products within the U.S., including Medical Aesthetics, Medical Dermatology through September 20, 2018, Eye Care and Neuroscience and Urology therapeutic products. 

Our US General Medicine business is focused on newly developed pharmaceutical products, which are normally patented or have market exclusivity. These patented and off-patent trademarked products are branded pharmaceutical products, and as a result of patents or other market exclusivity are generally offered by a single provider when first introduced to the market. We market a number of branded products to physicians, hospitals, and other customers that we serve as well as the end patient. 

Our International segment offers a wide array of branded products, including aesthetics products, outside of the United States.

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Business Strategies  

Our US Specialized Therapeutics business is focused on maintaining a leading position in the therapeutic areas in which we participate within the U.S. market. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on targeted activities, including direct-to-consumer advertising to increase consumer awareness of our products and also to engage specialty physicians and surgeons through our sales professionals and other programs to ensure they are fully informed about our product offerings. For reimbursed products, we also contract with payors to ensure that our products are widely available to patients. 

In our US General Medicine business, we market our branded products through our active sales professionals in the United States. Our sales and marketing efforts focus on both general practitioners and specialty physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of particular medical conditions. We also conduct targeted activities, including direct-to-consumer advertising to increase consumer awareness of our products. We believe that our current sales force structure gives us a competitive advantage in launching and promoting products due to our ability to reach a larger target audience of both general practitioners and specialists. For reimbursed products, we also contract with payors to ensure that our products are widely available to patients. 

Our International business is focused on maintaining a leading position by offering a consistent and reliable supply of quality branded and aesthetic products in key markets. We have maintained an ongoing effort to enhance efficiencies and reduce costs in our manufacturing operations.  

Research and Development 

We devote significant resources to the R&D of branded products, biosimilars and proprietary drug delivery technologies. R&D activities are expensed as incurred and consist of self-funded R&D costs, the costs associated with work performed under collaborative R&D agreements, regulatory fees, and acquisition and license related milestone payments, if any.  

Our R&D strategy focuses on the following product development areas: 

•  

the application of proprietary drug-delivery technology for new product development in specialty areas; 

•  

the acquisition of mid-to-late development-stage brand drugs;  

•  

early stage collaboration arrangements; and 

•  

the development of sustained-release, semi-solid, liquid, oral transmucosal, transdermal, gel, injectable, and other drug delivery technologies and the application of these technologies to proprietary drug forms. 

9 

As of December 31, 2019, we are developing a number of products, some of which utilize novel drug delivery systems, through a combination of internal and collaborative programs including but not limited to the following: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In addition to the projects listed in the table above, the Company continues to develop brazikumab, a gastrointestinal development project for indications of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. On January 27, 2020, in connection with the AbbVie Transaction, Allergan announced that it entered into a definitive agreement to divest brazikumab. This agreement was made in conjunction with the ongoing regulatory approval process for the AbbVie Transaction. AstraZeneca plc will acquire brazikumab, including global development and commercial rights. The closing of the divestiture of brazikumab is contingent upon receipt of U.S. Federal Trade Commission and European Commission approval, closing of the AbbVie Transaction and the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions.  

As of December 31, 2019, we conducted the majority of our branded drug delivery R&D activities in Irvine, California. We are presently developing a number of products through a combination of internal and collaborative programs. 

Financial Information About Segments and Geographic Areas 

The Company evaluates segment performance based on segment contribution. Segment contribution for our segments represents net revenues less cost of sales (defined below), selling and marketing expenses, and select general and administrative expenses. The Company does not evaluate the following items at the segment level: 

•  

Revenues and operating expenses within cost of sales, selling and marketing expenses, and general and administrative expenses that result from the impact of corporate initiatives. Corporate initiatives primarily include integration, restructuring, divestitures, acquisitions, certain milestones and other shared costs. 

•  

General and administrative expenses that result from shared infrastructure, including certain expenses located within the United States. 

•  

Other select revenues and operating expenses including R&D expenses, amortization, IPR&D impairments, goodwill impairments and asset sales and impairments, net as not all such information has been accounted for at the segment level, or such information has not been used by all segments.  

•  

Total assets including capital expenditures. 

The Company defines segment net revenues as product sales and other revenue derived from our products or licensing agreements.  

Cost of sales within segment contribution includes standard production and packaging costs for the products we manufacture, third-party acquisition costs for products manufactured by others, profit-sharing or royalty payments for products sold pursuant to licensing agreements and finished goods inventory reserve charges. Cost of sales within segment contribution excludes non-standard production costs, such as non-finished goods inventory obsolescence charges, manufacturing variances and excess capacity utilization charges, where applicable. Cost of sales does not include amortization or impairment costs for acquired product rights or other acquired intangibles. 

Selling and marketing expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, product promotion costs, distribution costs, professional service costs, insurance, depreciation and travel costs.  

10 

General and administrative expenses consist mainly of personnel-related costs, facilities costs, transaction costs, insurance, depreciation, litigation costs and professional services costs which are general in nature and attributable to the segment.  

Customers 

In US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International operations, we sell our brand and aesthetic products primarily to drug wholesalers, retailers and distributors, including national retail drug and food store chains, hospitals, clinics, mail order retailers, government agencies and managed healthcare providers such as health maintenance organizations and other institutions. Certain medical aesthetic products and devices are also sold directly to physicians.  

Sales to certain of our customers within the U.S. and Canada accounted for 10% or more of our annual revenues during the past three years. The following table illustrates customers and the respective percentage of revenues which they comprised in each of the last three years: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our significant customers comprise a large part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in North America. As a result, a small number of large wholesaler distributors control a significant share of the market for our products. No customer in a country outside the U.S. and Canada had 10% or more of global sales. 

The loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  

Competition 

The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. In our US Specialized Therapeutics, US General Medicine and International businesses, we compete with different companies to develop competitive products, in certain product categories, and within each applicable product category, upon dosage strengths and drug delivery systems. Our competitors include the major brand name manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. In addition to product development, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product quality, price, reputation, service and access to proprietary and technical information. It is possible that developments by others will make our products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. 

Competing in the brand and aesthetic product business requires us to identify and successfully bring to market new products embodying technological innovations. Successful marketing of brand and aesthetic products depends primarily on the ability to communicate the effectiveness, safety and value of these products to healthcare professionals in private practice and group practices and to receive formulary status from managed care organizations. We anticipate that our brand and aesthetic product offerings will support our existing areas of therapeutic focus. Based upon business conditions and other factors, we regularly reevaluate our business strategies and may from time to time reallocate our resources from one therapeutic area to another, withdraw from a therapeutic area or add an additional therapeutic area in order to maximize our overall growth opportunities.  

Many of our competitors, except for those in the Medical Aesthetics business, have been in business for a longer period of time, have a greater number of products on the market and have greater financial and other resources than we do. When we directly compete with these companies for certain contracted business or for the same markets and/or products, their financial strength could prevent us from capturing a meaningful share of those markets. 

Social Contract 

In September 2016, we introduced our Social Contract with Patients, in which we pledged to invest in new and innovative treatments, make our treatments accessible and affordable to patients, provide enhanced patient assistance programs (including in some cases free medicine) to eligible patients and maintain safety reporting and quality standards. Additionally, in our Social Contract with Patients, we committed to limit price increases. If we increase prices on our products, we will limit increases to once per year, and only increase the list price of a product by single-digit percentages. Our expectation is that net price increases, which are price increases after discounts and rebates, would be in the low to mid- single digit range. 

11 

For the full-year 2019, our net price on U.S. products increased by an average 0.1 percent, and list price increases averaged 7.7 percent. The difference between the net price decreases and the list price increases is due to higher rebates and discounts. 

Manufacturing, Suppliers and Materials  

As of December 31, 2019, we manufactured certain of our own finished products at our plants. We also have development and manufacturing capabilities for raw material and active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and intermediate ingredients to support our R&D internal product development efforts in our Campbell, California, Irvine, California and Liverpool, United Kingdom locations.  

We have major manufacturing sites in:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our manufacturing operations are subject to extensive regulatory oversight and could be interrupted at any time. Refer to Legal Matters in “NOTE 26 — Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in this document. 

While we manufacture certain of our own finished products at our plants, we are dependent on third parties for the supply of many of our finished products. In addition, we are dependent on third parties for the supply of the raw materials necessary to develop and manufacture our commercialized products, including the API and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients used in many of these products. We are required to identify the supplier(s) of all the raw materials for our products in the drug applications that we file with the FDA in the U.S. and other regulatory authorities outside the U.S. If raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier specified in a drug application, we would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the FDA and with other regulatory authorities outside the U.S., which could interrupt manufacturing of the affected product. To the extent practicable, we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application. However, some raw materials are available only from a single source and, in many of our drug applications, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified, even in instances where multiple sources exist. 

Furthermore, we obtain a significant portion of our raw materials from foreign suppliers. Arrangements with international raw material suppliers are subject to, among other things, FDA regulation, customs clearance, various import duties, foreign currency risk and other government clearances. Acts of governments outside the U.S. may affect the price or availability of raw materials needed for the development or manufacture of our products. In addition, any changes in patent laws in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may make it increasingly difficult to obtain raw materials for R&D prior to the expiration of the applicable U.S. or foreign patents. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — If we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of raw materials, our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded.” and — “The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by regulations promulgated by the European Union.” in this document. 

Patents and Proprietary Rights  

We believe patent protection of our proprietary products is important to our products. Our success with our branded products will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, and successfully defend if challenged, patent or other proprietary protection for such products. We currently have a number of U.S. and foreign patents issued or pending. However, the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or as to the enforceable scope of the claims of the patent. Accordingly, our patents may not prevent other companies from developing similar or functionally equivalent products or from successfully challenging the validity of our patents. If our patent applications are not allowed or, even if allowed, if such patents are circumvented or not upheld in a court of law or in  

12 

administrative proceedings, including oppositions, re-examinations or inter partes review (“IPR”), our ability to competitively market our patented products and technologies may be significantly reduced. Also, such patents may or may not provide competitive advantages for their respective products or they may be challenged or circumvented by competitors, in which case our ability to commercially market these products may be diminished. From time to time, we may need to obtain licenses to patents and other proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to commercially market such products may be inhibited or prevented. In addition, patents covering, for example, Actonel® (certain indications), Androderm®, Carafate®, Minastrin®, Estrace® Cream, Femhrt®, INFed®, Namenda® (IR), Pylera® and Rapaflo® products have expired and we have no further patent protection on these products. Generic versions of our Minastrin® product entered the market during 2017 pursuant to settlement agreements previously entered into. Generic versions of our Estrace® product entered the market in January 2018, generic versions of our Namenda XR® product entered the market in March 2018, generic versions of our Rapaflo® product entered the market in December 2018, and a generic version of our Carafate® product entered the market in December 2019.  

We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality agreements with our partners, customers, employees and consultants. It is possible that these agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable in every instance, and we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach. It is also possible that our trade secrets will otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. 

We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent and trademark rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation concerning patents, trademarks, copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and, as with litigation generally, the outcome is inherently uncertain. 

Litigation alleging infringement of patents, trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property rights may be costly and time consuming. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — Third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products.” and Legal Matters in “NOTE 26 — Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in this document. 

Government Regulation and Regulatory Matters  

The following discussion focuses on key markets to the Company’s overall business. 

United States  

All U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Allergan, are subject to extensive, complex and evolving regulation by the federal government, principally the FDA, and to a lesser extent, by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), Occupational Safety and Health Administration and state government agencies, as well as by various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our products or product candidates are being manufactured and/or marketed. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”), the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing, manufacturing, packing, labeling, storing, record keeping, safety, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of our products. In our international markets, the approval, manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products is similar to that of the United States with some variations dependent upon local market dynamics. 

Specialty Pharmaceuticals 

In the United States, FDA approval is required before any dosage form of any new drug, including an off-patent equivalent of a previously approved drug, can be marketed. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous, time-consuming and costly, and the extent to which it may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments cannot be predicted. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping new products. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — If we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products, our operating results will suffer.” and “— Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.” in this document. 

13 

All applications for FDA approval must contain information relating to product formulation, raw material suppliers, stability, manufacturing processes, packaging, labeling and quality control. We file a New Drug Application (“NDA”) when we seek approval for drugs with active ingredients and/or with dosage strengths, dosage forms, delivery systems or pharmacokinetic profiles that have not been previously approved by the FDA. Generally, NDAs are filed for new chemical entities or for a new dosage form of previously approved drugs. 

For innovative or non-generic new drugs, an FDA-approved NDA is required before the drug may be marketed in the United States. The NDA must contain data to demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective for its intended uses and that it will be manufactured to appropriate quality standards. In order to demonstrate safety and effectiveness, an NDA generally must include or reference pre-clinical studies and clinical data from controlled trials in humans. For a new chemical entity, this generally means that lengthy, uncertain and rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing must be conducted. For compounds that have a record of prior or current use, it may be possible to utilize existing data or medical literature and limited new testing to support an NDA. Any pre-clinical testing that we wish to rely upon for FDA action must comply with the FDA’s good laboratory practice and other requirements. Clinical testing in human subjects must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practice and other requirements. In order to initiate a clinical trial, the sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA or meet one of the narrow exemptions that exist from the IND requirement. 

The FDA has the authority to either approve or not approve NDAs, and if an application is not approved, additional data (clinical, non-clinical, manufacturing or quality data, among other types of data) is generally required. In addition, the FDA may approve an NDA subject to post-approval studies or monitoring requirements, or require that other risk management measures be utilized when the product is commercialized. There are also requirements to conduct pediatric trials for all new NDAs and supplements to NDAs for pharmaceutical products that may be used in the pediatric patient population, unless a waiver or deferral applies. 

Once approved, the NDA is subject to life-cycle management regulations (for example, annual reports) in order to maintain product registrations. A Supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) is required for changes that require FDA evaluation and/or approval prior to implementation, including the transfer of certain products from one manufacturing site to another, a change in API supplier, or a new indication or dosage form. In addition, a change in the manufacturing site for certain products may only be approved once new bioequivalency studies are conducted or other requirements are satisfied. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing studies. 

To obtain FDA approval of NDAs and sNDAs, our manufacturing procedures and operations must conform to FDA quality system and control requirements generally referred to as current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”), as defined in Title 21 of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, and cGMP must be adhered to throughout the life cycle of a product, as these regulations encompass all aspects of the production process from receipt and qualification of components to distribution procedures for finished products. cGMP standards are evolving standards; thus, we must continue to expend substantial time, money and effort in all production and quality control areas to maintain compliance with these standards. The evolving and complex nature of regulatory requirements, the broad authority and discretion of the FDA, and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in the continuing possibility that we may be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our efforts to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements. 

We are subject to the periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and/or the testing of our products by the FDA, the DEA and other health authorities, which conduct periodic inspections to assess compliance with applicable regulations. In addition, in connection with its review of our applications for new products, the FDA conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes comply with cGMP and other FDA regulations. Among other things, the FDA may withhold approval of NDAs, sNDAs, or other product applications of a facility if deficiencies are found at that facility. Vendors that supply finished products or components to us that we use to manufacture, package and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections. 

Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form 483 and Warning Letters that may require us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection. A Form 483 notice may be issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection and lists issues the FDA investigators believe may violate cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a Warning Letter be issued only for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly address the correction to the satisfaction of the FDA may be expected to result in an enforcement action.  

Additionally, FDA reviews promotional and marketing materials for compliance with the FFDCA and FDA regulations. FDA may issue letters or take other enforcement action if FDA believes promotional and marketing materials do not comply with the law and regulations. 

14 

Failure to comply with FDA and other governmental regulations can result in fines, unanticipated compliance expenditures, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production and/or distribution, suspension of the FDA’s review of NDAs or sNDAs or other product application enforcement actions, injunctions and criminal prosecution. Under certain circumstances, the FDA also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals. Although we have internal compliance programs, if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if our compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — Extensive industry regulation has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business, especially our product development, manufacturing and distribution capabilities.” in this document. The FDA can also significantly delay the approval of any pending NDA or other regulatory submissions under the Fraud, Untrue Statements of Material Facts, Bribery and Illegal Gratuities Policy Act. 

Medical Devices  

Medical devices are subject to regulation by the FDA, state agencies and foreign government health authorities. FDA regulations, as well as various U.S. federal and state laws, govern the development, clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, record keeping and marketing of medical device products agencies in the United States. Our medical device product candidates, including our breast implants, must undergo rigorous clinical testing and an extensive government regulatory clearance or approval process prior to sale in the United States and other countries. The lengthy process of clinical development and submissions for clearance or approval, and the continuing need for compliance with applicable laws and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory clearance or approval, when and if obtained, may be limited in scope, and may significantly limit the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed. Cleared or approved products and their manufacturers are subject to ongoing review, and discovery of previously unknown problems with products may result in restrictions on their manufacture, sale, and/or use or require their withdrawal from the market.  

Our medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we market in the United States must have a 510(k) clearance or a Premarket Approval Application (“PMA”) in accordance with the FFDCA and its implementing regulations. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of controls that are needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed to pose a lower risk are placed in either Class I or Class II, and devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or a device deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III. In general, a Class III device cannot be marketed in the United States unless the FDA approves the device after submission of a PMA, and any changes to the device subsequent to initial FDA approval must also be reviewed and approved by the FDA. The majority of our medical device products, including our breast implants, are regulated as Class III medical devices. A Class III device may have significant additional obligations imposed in its conditions of approval, and the time in which it takes to obtain approval can be long. Compliance with regulatory requirements is assured through periodic, unannounced facility inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors or other third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters or untitled letters; fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals that are already granted; and criminal prosecution. 

A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”), which must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. A study sponsor must obtain approval for its IDE from the FDA, and it must also obtain approval of its study from the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”) overseeing the trial. The results of clinical testing may not be sufficient to obtain approval of the investigational device.  

Once a device is approved, the manufacture and distribution of the device remains subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including Quality System Regulation requirements, which involve design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process. Medical device manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments and list their manufactured devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with regulatory requirements. Manufacturers must also report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that could likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or if the manufacturer conducts a field correction or product recall or removal to reduce a risk to health posed by a device or to remedy a violation of the FFDCA that may present a health risk. Further, the FDA continues to regulate device labeling, and prohibits the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses along with other labeling restrictions. If a manufacturer or distributor fails to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, or if safety concerns with a device arise, the FDA may take legal or regulatory action, including civil or criminal penalties, suspension, withdrawal or delay in the issuance of clearances or approvals, or seizure or recall of products, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect upon us.  

15 

Other Regulatory Requirements Applicable to Our Business 

The FDA imposes a number of complex regulatory requirements on entities that advertise and promote pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including, but not limited to, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, “off-label” promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities including internet marketing. Pharmaceutical products and medical devices can only be marketed for indications approved or cleared by the FDA. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in penalties, the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials be pre-cleared by the FDA, and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.  

U.S. government reimbursement programs include Medicare, Medicaid, TriCare, and State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs established according to statute, government regulations and policy. Federal law requires all pharmaceutical manufacturers, as a condition of having their products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, to pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on units of their pharmaceuticals that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. With enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), as amended, manufacturer rebate liability for brand drugs increased from 15.1% to 23.1% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or the difference between the Average Manufacturer Price and the drug’s Best Price (i.e., the lowest net sales price to a non-government customer during a specified period), whichever is greater. In some states, supplemental rebates are required as a condition of including the manufacturer’s drug on a state’s Preferred Drug List, which if agreed upon would generally permit access to a manufacturer’s product without utilization management (e.g., step therapy). 

The ACA prescribed that the coverage gap phase of the Medicare Part D benefit be closed such that, by 2020, beneficiaries will pay co-insurance of 25% (or co-payment equivalents) of the cost of prescription drugs dispensed to them under their applicable Medicare Part D plans, until they reach the catastrophic phase of the Medicare Part D benefit. Beginning in 2011, brand drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50% discount on their drugs while beneficiaries are in the coverage gap; the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, however, increased this discount to 70% beginning in 2019. Additionally, beginning in 2013, the government and Medicare Part D plan sponsors began providing additional subsidies for brand name drugs bought by seniors who enter the coverage gap. The government/sponsor share originally was designed to provide a 25% discount in the cost of drugs by 2020, however the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 revised this percentage down to 5%. Consequently, the combined industry discounts and government subsidies still will add up to 75% of brand name drug costs in 2020, however, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to extend far greater discounts under this coverage gap program than originally was contemplated.  

On January 21, 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a final rule on the calculation of AMP, Best Price, and the Unit Rebate Amount for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; the final rule took effect in April 2016 (for most provisions). Allergan has implemented required changes to its Medicaid rebate calculations and policies, effective for its Q2 2016 calculations and pricing submissions. Notably, however, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires compliance with complex statutory pricing formulas and requirements, and manufacturers frequently are required to adopt “reasonable assumptions,” as permitted by CMS guidance, where the regulations are silent or unclear. Any changes in existing CMS guidance could affect our compliance efforts, existing reasonable assumptions, and rebate liability. We are also required to discount products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, under which additional laws and requirements apply. 

The ACA also expanded the government’s 340B drug discount program by adding new categories of covered entity types that are qualified to participate in the program and benefit from its deeply discounted drug pricing. The ACA also obligated the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), which administers the 340B program, to update the Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement, which each manufacturer must sign to participate in the 340B program, to require each manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes its drugs available to any other purchaser at any price, and to report statutory ceiling prices for its drugs to the government. HRSA issued this update in late 2016 and the Company subsequently signed and executed an amendment to our agreement. In addition, on January 5, 2017, HRSA finalized regulations that, among other things, implement rules regarding civil monetary penalties for knowing and intentional overcharges of 340B covered entities by pharmaceutical manufacturers; after a series of regulatory delays, these rules became effective for transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2019. 

In connection with the commercialization of our products, we often are required to negotiate and enter into discount and rebate agreements for our products with government and private health insurers, including Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”) and Managed Care Organizations (“MCOs”). These discount and rebate agreements commonly are required to ensure the accessibility of our drugs to beneficiaries of the individual health insurance plans, whether sponsored by the government or a commercial entity. Indeed, the sale of our existing and any future products largely is dependent on the extent to which our products are covered by health insurance. Any changes to product coverage requirements, including pursuant to federal law or regulation, or government or private drug cost containment measures could have an adverse effect on our business operations. 

16 

Additionally, we may in the future -- as we have in the past -- receive requests for information, sometimes in the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas, from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and the European Commission - Competition. Any adverse outcome of these types of investigations or actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business—Federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business.” Also refer to Legal Matters in “NOTE 26 — Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in this document. 

As part of the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”), companies are required to file with the FTC and the Department of Justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture, marketing and sale of generic versions of brand drugs. This requirement could affect the manner in which drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with competitor pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private-party litigation against pharmaceutical companies. The impact of this requirement, and the potential private-party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers, is uncertain and could adversely affect our business. For example, beginning in April 2013, private parties have filed lawsuits against us alleging that a settlement of a patent litigation between a subsidiary of the Company and potential generic competitor that had filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”) for a generic version of Loestrin® is unlawful. Those lawsuits remain pending. Refer to Legal Matters in “NOTE 26 — Commitments and Contingencies” in the accompanying “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” in this document. 

Federal, state, local and foreign laws of general applicability, such as laws regulating working conditions, also govern us. In addition, we are subject, as are all manufacturers generally, to numerous and increasingly stringent federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations, and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. Our environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or increased manufacturing activities at any of our facilities. We could be adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws, including the costs of undertaking a clean-up at a site to which our wastes were transported. 

European Union 

We encounter similar regulatory and legislative issues in most other countries, including countries that are members of the European Union (the “EU”). Pharmaceutical manufacturers are regulated in the EU by the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) and national health authorities. All manufacturers are required to submit medicinal products, including generic versions of previously approved products and new strengths, dosages and formulations of previously approved products, to the EMA and/or its member states for review and marketing authorization before such products are placed on the market in the EU. 

Marketing authorizations are granted to applicants after the relevant health authority issues a positive assessment of quality, safety and efficacy of the product. In order to receive such assessment, applicants must submit applications, which must contain or reference the results of pre-clinical tests, pharmaceutical tests, and clinical trials with respect to originator products. All of these tests or trials must be conducted in accordance within European regulations and must allow the reviewing body to evaluate the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product. 

In addition to obtaining marketing authorization for each product, all member states require that a manufacturer’s facilities obtain approval from the national authority. The EU has a code of good manufacturing practices that each manufacturer must follow and comply with. Regulatory authorities in the EU may conduct inspections of the manufacturing facilities to review procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. Refer to “ITEM 1A. — RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — The supply of APIs into Europe may be negatively affected by regulations promulgated by the European Union.” in this document. 

In the EU, member states regulate the pricing of pharmaceutical products, and in some cases, the formulation and dosing of products. This regulation is handled by individual member state national health services. These individual regulatory bodies can result in considerable price differences and product availability among member states. The implementation of tendering systems for the pricing of pharmaceuticals in several countries generally impacts drug pricing; generally “tendering” refers to a system that requires bids to be submitted to the relevant national health services organizations by competing manufacturers to be the exclusive, or one of a few, supplier(s) of a product for such tender. 

17 

Further, faced with major budget constraints, many European countries have resorted to price cuts or claim-back schemes that affect both innovative and generic pharmaceuticals. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business—Global economic conditions could harm us.” in this document.  

Medical device products that are marketed in the European Union must comply with the requirements of the Medical Device Directive (the “MDD”), as implemented in the national legislation of the European Union member states. The MDD, as implemented, provides for a regulatory regime with respect to the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices to ensure that medical devices marketed in the European Union are safe and effective for their intended uses. Medical devices that comply with the MDD, as implemented, are entitled to bear a Conformité Européenne (“CE”) marking evidencing such compliance and may be marketed in the European Union. Failure to comply with these domestic and international regulatory requirements could affect our ability to market and sell our products in these countries. For example, following the non-renewal of our textured breast implant CE Mark licenses in Europe pending the request for additional information by LNE-GMED, the notified body responsible for certification of our breast implants, Allergan suspended sales of textured breast implants in Europe and withdrew the remaining textured breast implants then on the market in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2018. The MDD will be superseded by new legislation, the Medical Device Regulation (the “MDR”), which will come into effect in May 2020. The MDR will essentially operate in the same way as the MDD to ensure a harmonized approach in the European Union to ensuring the safety and performance of medical devices, and failure to comply with the MDR could affect our ability to market and sell our products in the European Union member states. 

Canada 

In Canada, pharmaceutical manufacturers are regulated by the Therapeutic Products Directorate (the “TPD”) which derives its authority from the Canadian federal government under the Food and Drugs Act and the Controlled Drug and Substances Act. The TPD evaluates and monitors the safety, effectiveness and quality of pharmaceutical products. Products are officially approved for marketing in Canada following receipt of a market authorization, or “Notice of Compliance” (a “NOC”), which is subject to the Food and Drug Regulations. Issuance of a NOC for generic drug products is also subject to the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations (the “NOC Regulations”) under the Patent Act. 

The NOC Regulations allow branded drug marketers to list patents that contain a claim for a medicinal ingredient, a claim for the formulation containing the medicinal ingredient, a claim for the dosage form, or a claim for the use of the medicinal ingredient in their branded drug on a patent register maintained by the TPD. In its abbreviated new drug submission, a generic applicant must address each patent listed against the reference product by making at least one statutory allowed allegation (for example, alleging that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed). If the generic applicant alleges invalidity or non-infringement, it must provide the branded manufacturer with an explanation of its allegations. Upon receipt of the explanation, the branded manufacturer may commence an action against the generic applicant in the Federal Court of Canada for a declaration that the making, constructing, using or selling of the generic applicant’s drug would infringe any patent that is subject of an allegation. The NOC Regulations prohibits the Minister of Health from issuing an NOC to the generic applicant that is a party to the action, for a 24-month period from the day on which the action is brought, until the action is determined by the court. The branded manufacturer who brought the action, may also renounce application of the 24-month period but this could allow for early market entry, subject to data protection and the generic applicant’s willingness to launch at risk. 

Facilities, procedures, operations and/or testing of products are subject to periodic inspection by Health Canada and the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate. In addition, Health Canada conducts pre-approval and post-approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems are in compliance with the good manufacturing practices in Canada, Drug Establishment Licensing requirements and other provisions of the NOC Regulations. Competitors are subject to similar regulations and inspections. 

Each Canadian province and territory also provides a comprehensive public drug program, which controls drug pricing and reimbursement and is responsible for ensuring eligible patients receive drugs through public funding. The provinces and territories in Canada operate drug benefit programs through which eligible recipients receive drugs through public funding; these drugs are listed on provincial or territorial Drug Benefit Formularies (“Formularies”). Eligible recipients include seniors, persons on social assistance, low-income earners, and those with certain specified conditions or diseases. Formulary listings are also used by private payors to reimburse generic products. To be listed in a Formulary, drug products must have been issued a NOC and must comply with each jurisdiction’s individual review process. Currently, Canada’s provinces and territories are looking at national competitive bidding processes/tendering of drugs, which may affect the sustainability of the industry and the supply of pharmaceuticals. 

Finally, Canada has reached a trade agreement with the European Union (the “Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement”) in which it has implemented a form of patent term extensions and certain procedural amendments to the NOC Regulations. Canada is further involved in trade negotiations with ten Pacific countries (the “Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership”), which could lead to further changes to Canada’s intellectual property framework and affect our business.

Environmental Matters 

We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations in the United States and abroad. Our environment, health and safety group monitors our operations around the world, providing us with an overview of regulatory requirements and overseeing the implementation of our standards for compliance. We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we have a business presence, and we periodically audit our manufacturing and R&D facilities for compliance with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although we continue to make capital expenditures for environmental protection, we do not anticipate any significant expenditure in order to comply with such laws and regulations that would have a material impact on our earnings or competitive position. We are not aware of any pending litigation or significant financial obligations arising from current or past environmental practices that are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position. We cannot assure, however, that environmental problems relating to facilities owned or operated by us will not develop in the future, and we cannot predict whether any such problems, if they were to develop, could require significant expenditures on our part.  

Climate change presents risks to our operations, including the potential for additional regulatory requirements and associated costs, and the potential for more frequent and severe weather events and water availability challenges that may impact our facilities and those of our suppliers. These potential risks are integrated into the Company’s business planning including investment in reducing energy, water use and greenhouse gas emissions. We cannot provide assurance that physical risks to our facilities and supply chain due to climate change will not occur in the future; however we do not believe these risks are material to our business at this time. 

In addition, we are unable to predict what legislation or regulations may be adopted or enacted in the future with respect to environmental protection and waste disposal. Refer to “ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS — Risks Related to Our Business — Our business will continue to expose us to risks of environmental liabilities.” in this document. 

Seasonality 

Consistent with the United States pharmaceutical industry, our business experiences seasonality, with the first quarter of each year typically being the lowest revenue quarter for our products. In addition, our aesthetics products, including our Botox® cosmetic indications, have tended to be marginally higher during the second and fourth quarters, presumably in advance of the summer vacation and holiday seasons. Fluctuations of our sales are also impacted by the effect of promotional activity, which cause non-seasonal variability in sales trends. 

Backlog 

As a result of the extent of our supply chain, backlog of orders is not material to our business. 

Employees 

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 17,400 employees. Of our employees, approximately 2,400 were engaged to support R&D functions, 4,900 supported Cost of Goods Sold functions, 8,700 supported sales, marketing and distribution functions, and 1,400 supported administrative functions.
