However, we used our fee schedule and the aggregate number and amount of transactions involving the Iranian embassies and Iranian airlines to estimate the net revenue and net profit we obtained during the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and (as to one of the airlines) the seven years ended December 31, 2018. Both the number of transactions and our estimated net revenue and net profits for this period are de minimis."
