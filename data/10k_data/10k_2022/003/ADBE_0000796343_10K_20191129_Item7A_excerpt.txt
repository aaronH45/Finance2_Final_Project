ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

All market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non-trading purposes.

Foreign Currency Risk

Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Instruments

In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. Dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates. We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge our foreign currency revenue. Additionally, we hedge our net recognized foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities with foreign exchange forward contracts. We hedge these exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. 

Our significant foreign currency revenue exposures for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 were as follows :

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of November 29, 2019, the total absolute value of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts, including options and forwards, was $1.90 billion, which included the notional equivalent of $927.0 million in Euros, $431.0 million in British Pounds, $341.3 million in Japanese Yen and $201.8 million in other foreign currencies. As of November 29, 2019, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through June 2020. The bank counterparties in these contracts could expose us to credit-related losses that would be largely mitigated with master netting arrangements with the same counterparty by permitting net settlement

transactions. In addition, we enter into collateral security agreements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of these contracts fluctuates from contractually established thresholds.

A sensitivity analysis was performed on all of our foreign exchange derivatives as of November 29, 2019. This sensitivity analysis measures the hypothetical market value resulting from a 10% shift in the value of exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. For option contracts, the Black-Scholes option pricing model was used. A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the value of the hedged foreign currency asset would lead to an increase in the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $113.6 million. Conversely, a 10% decrease in the value of the U.S. Dollar would result in a decrease in the fair value of these financial instruments by $33.4 million.

As a general rule, we do not use foreign exchange contracts to hedge local currency denominated operating expenses in countries where a natural hedge exists. For example, in many countries, revenue in the local currencies substantially offsets the local currency denominated operating expenses. We also have long-term investment exposures consisting of the capitalization and retained earnings in our non-U.S. Dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $385.2 million and $292.3 million, respectively, with the year-over-year increase primarily driven by earnings growth. At this time, we do not hedge these long-term investment exposures.

We do not use foreign exchange contracts for speculative trading purposes, nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates. We regularly review our hedging program and assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis.

Cash Flow Hedges of Forecasted Foreign Currency Revenue 

We may use foreign exchange purchased options or forward contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Japanese Yen. We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, may have maturities between one and twelve months. We enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge forecasted revenue in the normal course of business and accordingly, they are not speculative in nature.

We record changes in fair value of these cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated revenue in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the forecasted transaction occurs. When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the cash flow hedge to revenue. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur, or it becomes probable that it will not occur, we reclassify the gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to revenue. For the fiscal year ended November 29, 2019, there were no net gains or losses recognized in revenue relating to hedges of forecasted transactions that did not occur.

Non-Designated Hedges of Foreign Currency Assets and Liabilities

Our derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist of foreign currency forward contracts that we primarily use to hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are carried at fair value with changes in fair value of these contracts recorded to interest and other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. These contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities. At November 29, 2019, the outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives had maturities of 180 days or less.

See Note 6 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our derivative financial instruments.

Interest Rate Risk

Short-Term Investments and Fixed Income Securities

At November 29, 2019, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $1.53 billion. Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these investments. A sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of November 29, 2019. The analysis is based on an estimate of the hypothetical changes in market value of the portfolio that would result from an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of various magnitudes.

The following tables present the hypothetical fair values of our debt securities classified as short-term investments assuming immediate parallel shifts in the yield curve of 50 basis points (“BPS”), 100 BPS and 150 BPS. The analysis is shown as of November 29, 2019 and November 30, 2018:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Term Loan 

As of November 29, 2019, our Term Loan’s carrying value was $2.25 billion. At our election, the Term Loan will bear interest at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.500% to 1.000% or (ii) a base rate plus a margin, based on our debt ratings, ranging from 0.040% to 0.110%. Interest is payable periodically, in arrears, at the end of each interest period we elect. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.

Senior Notes

As of November 29, 2019, the amount outstanding under our Notes was $1.9 billion. In June 2014, we entered into interest rate swaps that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on our 2020 Notes to a floating interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points through February 1, 2020. Accordingly, our exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates is on the hedged fixed-rate debt of $900 million. An immediate hypothetical 50 basis points increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on our results of operations.

As of November 29, 2019, the total carrying amount of the Notes was $1.89 billion and the related fair value based on observable market prices in less active markets was $1.96 billion.

Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk

In June 2019, in anticipation of refinancing our $2.25 billion Term Loan due April 30, 2020 and $900 million notes payable due February 1, 2020, we entered into Treasury lock agreements with large financial institutions which fixed benchmark U.S. Treasury rates for an aggregate notional amount of $1 billion of our future debt issuance. These derivative instruments hedge the impact of changes in the benchmark interest rate to future interest payments and will be terminated upon closing of our anticipated refinancing. We record changes in the fair value of these cash flow hedges of interest rate risk in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until the anticipated refinancing. Upon refinancing and termination of the derivative instruments, their fair value will be amortized over the term of our new debt to interest expense.
