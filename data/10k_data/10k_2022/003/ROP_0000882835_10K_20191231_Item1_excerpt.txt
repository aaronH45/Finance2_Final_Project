Our Business

Roper Technologies, Inc. (“Roper,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a diversified technology company. We operate businesses that design and develop software (both license and Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”)) and engineered products and solutions for a variety of niche end markets.

We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other businesses that offer high value-added software, services, engineered products and solutions that we believe are capable of achieving growth and maintaining high margins. We compete in many niche markets and believe we are the market leader or a competitive alternative to the market leader in most of these markets.

We were incorporated on December 17, 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Market Share, Market Expansion, and Product Development

Leadership with Engineered Content for Niche Markets - We maintain a leading position in many of our markets. We believe our market positions are attributable to the technical sophistication of our products and software, the applications expertise used to create our advanced products and systems, and our distribution and service capabilities. Our operating units grow their businesses through new product development and development of new applications and services to satisfy customer needs. In addition, our operating units grow our customer base by expanding our access to customers and entering adjacent markets.

Diversified End Markets and Geographic Reach - We have a global presence, with sales to customers outside the U.S. totaling $1.4 billion in 2019. Information regarding our international operations is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

Our Business Segments

During the first quarter of 2019, we implemented a realignment of our reportable segment structure. The new reportable segments continue to provide a transparent view into Roper’s operations and capital deployment strategy and objectives. The Company’s new reporting segment structure reinforces Roper’s diversified, niche market strategy by reporting based upon business models instead of end markets. The four new reportable segments (and businesses within each; including changes due to acquisitions and divestitures since the realignment) are as follows: 

–Application Software - Aderant, CBORD, CliniSys, Data Innovations, Deltek, Horizon, IntelliTrans, PowerPlan, Strata, Sunquest

–Network Software & Systems - ConstructConnect, DAT, Foundry, Inovonics, iPipeline, iTradeNetwork, Link Logistics, MHA, RF IDeas, SHP, SoftWriters, TransCore

–Measurement & Analytical Solutions (1) - Alpha, CIVCO Medical Solutions, CIVCO Radiotherapy, Dynisco, FMI, Hansen, Hardy, IPA, Logitech, Neptune, Northern Digital, Struers, Technolog, Uson, Verathon

–Process Technologies - AMOT, CCC, Cornell, FTI, Metrix, PAC, Roper Pump, Viatran, Zetec

(1) The Measurement & Analytical Solutions segment includes the results of the divestitures completed in 2019 through the transaction date for (i) Princeton Instruments, Photometrics, Lumenera, and other brands (collectively, the “Imaging” businesses), sold to Teledyne Technologies Inc. (“Teledyne”) on February 5, 2019 and (ii) Gatan, Inc. (“Gatan”) sold to AMETEK, Inc. (“AMETEK”) on October 29, 2019.

The Company’s strategy, organizational structure, and day-to-day operations of our businesses remain unchanged. All prior periods have been recast to reflect the changes noted above. Information regarding our business segments is set forth in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.

Materials and Suppliers

We believe most materials and supplies we use are readily available from numerous sources and suppliers throughout the world. However, some components and sub-assemblies are currently available from only a limited number of suppliers. We regularly investigate and identify alternative sources where possible, and we believe these conditions equally affect our competitors. Supply shortages have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues although delays in shipments have occurred following such supply interruptions.

Backlog

Our backlog includes only firm unfilled orders expected to be recognized as revenue within twelve months. Backlog was $1.99 billion at December 31, 2019, and $1.69 billion at December 31, 2018.

Distribution and Sales

Distribution and sales occur primarily through direct sales offices, manufacturers’ representatives, resellers and distributors. 

Environmental Matters and Other Governmental Regulation

Our operations and properties are subject to laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air emissions, water discharges, waste management and workplace safety. We use, generate and dispose of hazardous substances and waste in our operations and could be subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation and clean-up of contaminated properties and related claims. We are required to conform our operations and properties to these laws and adapt to regulatory requirements in all countries as these requirements change. In connection with our acquisitions, we may assume significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may not be aware of, or may not be quantifiable, at the time of acquisition. In addition, new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new requirements could increase our costs or subject us to new or increased liabilities.

Customers

No customer accounted for 10% or more of net revenues for 2019 for any of our segments or for our Company as a whole.

Competition

Generally, our products and solutions face significant competition, usually from a limited number of competitors. We believe that we are a leader in most of our markets, and no single company competes with us over a significant number of product lines. Competitors might be large or small in size, often depending on the size of the niche market we serve. We compete primarily on product quality, performance, innovation, technology, price, applications expertise, system and service flexibility, distribution channel access and customer service capabilities.

Patents and Trademarks

In addition to trade secrets, unpatented know-how, and other intellectual property rights, we own or license the rights under a number of patents, trademarks and copyrights relating to certain of our products and businesses. We also employ various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with individuals and companies we do business with, employees, distributors, representatives and customers to protect our trade secrets and know-how. We believe none of our operating units are substantially dependent on any single patent, trademark, copyright, or other item of intellectual property or group of patents, trademarks or copyrights.
