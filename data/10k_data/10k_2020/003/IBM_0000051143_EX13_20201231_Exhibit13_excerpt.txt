Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments include true-ups, accounting elections and any changes to regulations, laws, audit adjustments, etc. that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of the company’s acquisitions. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. Throughout the Management Discussion, the impact of acquisitions over the prior 12-month period may be a driver of higher expense year to year. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and the company considers these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business.

Overall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of the company’s pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows the company to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. Our reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with our management and measurement system. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts.

Strategic Announcement

IBM is redefining its future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. The October 8, 2020 announcement of our plan to separate the managed infrastructure services unit of our GTS segment into a new public company will create two industry-leading companies, each with strategic focus and flexibility to capitalize on their respective missions and drive client and shareholder value. Client buying needs for application and infrastructure services are diverging, while adoption of our hybrid cloud platform is accelerating. This change in clients’ needs makes it the right time to create two market-leading companies focused on what they do best. IBM will focus on its open hybrid cloud platform and AI capabilities to accelerate clients’ digital transformations. Upon separation, NewCo will immediately be the world's leading managed infrastructure services provider and will have greater agility to design, run and modernize the infrastructure of the world’s most important organizations. Both IBM and NewCo will have greater ability to focus on their operating and financial models, have more freedom to partner with others and both will align their investments and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. We are on track to complete the separation by the end of 2021.

Environmental Dynamics

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) a global pandemic. This resulted in significant governmental measures being initiated around the globe, including travel bans and border closings, shelter-in-place orders, closures of non-essential businesses and social distancing requirements in efforts to slow down and control the spread of the virus.

Throughout 2020, the health of IBM employees, our clients, business partners and community continued to be our primary focus. We are actively engaged to ensure our plans and response activities continue to be aligned with recommendations of the WHO, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and governmental regulations. 

IBM continues to be well positioned to support our clients through this crisis. The pandemic has driven companies to accelerate their digital transformations, resulting in the removal of traditional barriers to progress. The reliance on technology, particularly hybrid cloud and AI technologies that give clients the scalability and flexibility needed to adjust to the rapid market changes, has become more acute. We are helping to advise, build, move and manage our clients’ journey to the cloud. We are also working with our clients to apply AI, automation and other technologies to make their workflows more intelligent and responsive. As our clients are intensifying their focus on their most important asset, their people, we are partnering with clients to help them enhance employee engagement and productivity, reskill the workforce faster and reimagine ways of working.

The COVID-19 pandemic and broader macroeconomic uncertainty has placed every company in uncharted waters. In this environment, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to remain sound:

•Our diversification and mix by industry, geography and client segment provides some stability during these times;

•IBM has always focused on the enterprise space, and within that our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic;

•From an industry perspective, the majority of our revenue comes from clients in financial services, telecom, and the public sector – industries that run the world’s most critical processes;

•From a geographic perspective, we are continuing to see markets experience different impacts from the pandemic over time. Our global footprint provides some natural hedge; 

​

​

•Approximately 60 percent of our annual revenue is in recurring revenue streams;

•Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity and access to capital.

All of this provides some level of stability, not only in our revenue, but also in profit and cash, as we continue to manage through these challenging times. However, in this macroeconomic environment, clients balanced near-term needs and opportunities for transformation. Their near-term priorities were focused on operational stability, flexibility and cash preservation, and as such, in 2020, we experienced some disruptions in transactional performance, shorter duration software transactions and delays in some services projects.

At the same time, this environment has only reinforced the need for clients to modernize their businesses to succeed in this new normal, with hybrid cloud and AI at the core of their digital transformations. While the current environment poses certain short-term challenges, it also presents long-term opportunities that IBM will seize as our open hybrid platform and AI-driven model delivers greater innovation, higher productivity and more strategic optionality to our clients. 

Financial Performance Summary

In 2020, we reported $73.6 billion in revenue and income from continuing operations of $5.5 billion, which included a $2.0 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions (primarily workforce rebalancing) in the fourth quarter to simplify and optimize our operating model. Operating (non-GAAP) earnings in 2020 were $7.8 billion, which also included the charge for workforce rebalancing. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $6.13 as reported and $8.67 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We also generated $18.2 billion in cash from operations, $10.8 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $5.8 billion in dividends. With the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainty beginning in March 2020, client priorities shifted to maintaining operational stability, flexibility and preservation of cash. While there was continued demand for offerings that support their digital transformation, clients moved to shorter term duration engagements and prioritized operational expenditures over capital expenditures, which impacted the company’s performance in 2020. However, our results reflect strong performance in hybrid cloud led by Red Hat, gross margin expansion and solid cash generation. We also continued to strengthen our position as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company through strategic organic investments and acquisitions. 

Total consolidated revenue decreased 4.6 percent as reported and 4.7 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency, revenue decreased 3.5 percent. Cloud & Cognitive Software increased 2.1 percent as reported and 2 percent adjusted for currency, with strong performance from Red Hat, offset by declines in transactional performance in other areas of the portfolio. Within Cloud & Cognitive Software, Cloud & Data Platforms, which includes Red Hat, grew 20.9 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency), while Cognitive Applications decreased 3.0 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency), and Transaction Processing Platforms declined 16.8 percent as reported (17 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting the impacts of the macroeconomic uncertainty, with purchase deferrals and clients opting for shorter duration contracts. Global Business Services decreased 3.8 percent as reported and 4 percent adjusted for currency with declines across all lines of business due to project delays and less discretionary spending by clients. Global Technology Services decreased 5.7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency with declines in Infrastructure & Cloud Services and Technology Support Services driven by lower business volumes primarily with clients in industries more impacted by the macroeconomic environment. Systems decreased 8.2 percent year to year as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency due to product cycle dynamics. Across the segments, total IBM cloud revenue of $25.1 billion in 2020 grew 19 percent as reported (18 percent adjusted for currency) and 20 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue declined 6.0 percent year to year as reported (4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) decreased 3.3 percent (4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific declined 3.5 percent (4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency).

The consolidated gross margin of 48.3 percent increased 1.0 points year to year, and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 49.3 percent increased 1.3 points versus the prior year, reflecting portfolio mix with strong software contribution and our focus on productivity. 

Total expense and other (income) increased 17.5 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year performance was driven by higher charges for workforce rebalancing, a full year of Red Hat operational spending in 2020 compared to six months in 2019, lower gains from divestitures and higher non-operating retirement-related costs, partially offset by lower spending including reductions in travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 16.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors excluding the non-operating retirement-related costs. 

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $4.6 billion decreased 54.4 percent and the pre-tax margin was 6.3 percent, a decrease of 6.9 points versus 2019, primarily due to higher workforce rebalancing charges in 2020, lower gains from divestitures and higher retirement-related costs in the current year. The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2020 was (18.6) percent compared to 7.2

percent in 2019. The benefit from income taxes in 2020 was primarily due to the tax impacts of an intra-entity sale of certain of the company’s intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter, which resulted in a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion. Net income from continuing operations of $5.5 billion decreased 41.7 percent and the net income from continuing operations margin was 7.5 percent, down 4.8 points year to year, primarily due to the fourth-quarter workforce rebalancing charge. Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $7.7 billion decreased 38.7 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 5.8 points to 10.4 percent, reflecting the higher workforce rebalancing charges and lower gains from divestitures in the current year. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (1.5) percent compared to 8.5 percent in 2019. The current year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from an intra-entity IP sale in the first quarter. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $7.8 billion decreased 32.0 percent and the operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 10.6 percent was down 4.3 points year to year. 

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $6.13 in 2020 decreased 42.0 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $8.67 decreased 32.3 percent versus 2019, both including a ($1.84) impact from the fourth-quarter 2020 structural actions.

During 2020, we continued to take actions to further enhance our balance sheet and liquidity position. At December 31, 2020, the balance sheet remained strong with flexibility to support and invest in the business, with a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times. Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at year end were $14.3 billion, an increase of $5.3 billion from December 31, 2019. Throughout 2020, we took mitigation actions to preserve liquidity as well as strategic actions to optimize our capital structure, for example, we re-focused our Global Financing portfolio reducing our external debt needs. We have reduced total debt by $1.4 billion from prior year end and $11.5 billion since the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat transaction).

Total assets increased $3.8 billion (increased $0.9 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2019 primarily driven by:

•An increase of $5.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities;

•An increase in deferred taxes of $4.1 billion primarily due to the intra-entity sale of IP in the first quarter; and

•An increase in prepaid pension assets of $0.7 billion driven by higher returns on plan assets and plan remeasurements; partially offset by

•A decline in receivables of $6.5 billion mainly due to sales of financing receivables, continued focus on collections, including collection of divestiture-related receivables and a decline in revenue.

Total liabilities increased $4.0 billion (increased $0.1 billion adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2019 driven by:

•An increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $2.5 billion primarily due to the workforce rebalancing charge in the fourth quarter of 2020;

•An increase in deferred income of $1.3 billion; and

•An increase in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations of $1.1 billion mainly driven by plan remeasurements; partially offset by

•A decrease in total debt of $1.4 billion.

Total equity of $20.7 billion decreased $0.3 billion from December 31, 2019 as a result of:

•Dividends paid of $5.8 billion; partially offset by 

•Net income of $5.6 billion.

Cash provided by operating activities was $18.2 billion in 2020, an increase of $3.4 billion compared to 2019, driven primarily by an increase in cash provided by receivables ($4.8 billion); partially offset by performance-related declines within net income. 

Net cash used in investing activities of $3.0 billion decreased $23.9 billion compared to the prior year, primarily driven by a decrease in net cash used for acquisitions ($32.3 billion) due to the acquisition of Red Hat in the prior year, partially offset by a decrease in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables ($6.2 billion), primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations. 

Financing activities were a net use of cash of $9.7 billion in 2020 compared to a net source of cash of $9.0 billion in 2019. The year-to-year change of $18.8 billion was driven by a decrease in net cash provided from debt transactions ($20.0 billion) primarily driven by a higher level of net additions in the prior year to fund the Red Hat acquisition and a decrease in cash used for gross common stock repurchases ($1.4 billion).

DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Please refer to IBM’s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021, for Item 1A. entitled “Risk Factors.”

We create value for clients by providing integrated solutions and products that leverage: data, information technology, deep expertise in industries and business processes, with trust and security and a broad ecosystem of partners and alliances. Our hybrid cloud platform and AI technology and services capabilities support clients’ digital transformations and help them engage with their customers and employees in new ways. These solutions draw from an industry-leading portfolio of consulting and IT implementation services, cloud, digital and cognitive offerings, and enterprise systems and software which are all bolstered by one of the world’s leading research organizations.

IBM Strategy

As technology has increasingly become a key engine of business success, enterprises around the world are prioritizing digital transformation. The pressing need to adapt to evolving market requirements and adopt new business models that improve customer experience and streamline business performance has accelerated the urgency of this transformation. 

To date, only 25 percent of enterprise workloads have made it onto a public cloud– mostly limited to greenfield cloud applications or ones that are easy to “lift and shift”. The remaining 75 percent have not moved, as enterprises wrestle with how to handle the mission-critical workloads and data that require heightened security, particularly for highly regulated industries with complex, often cross-border, compliance needs. 

Hybrid cloud and AI are the only way to deliver the digital transformation businesses are looking for across all their processes, applications and data. Together, they have a multiplier effect on the speed and breadth of transformation. Only a fraction of enterprise data is being leveraged for business insights, in part because it is spread across public clouds, datacenters and increasingly, edge computing. The emergence of edge computing across many industries will only expand the kinds of hybrid environments our clients use.

A hybrid cloud approach bridges the silos within this existing enterprise infrastructure, maintaining security for mission-critical workloads while enabling the data collection and analysis that accelerates development and deployment of AI at scale. AI unlocks the value of enterprise data, using it to reinvent processes, predict outcomes and transform businesses.

The pressing need to pivot to remote work and reinvent their business models during the pandemic accelerated the urgency of this transformation for many enterprises. Companies are focused more than ever on moving workloads to the cloud. 

IBM’s Commitment to Hybrid Cloud and AI 

That makes hybrid cloud and AI an enormous opportunity for IBM. Hybrid cloud alone represents a $1 trillion market. 

We are targeting this market because we recognize the value it brings to our clients. Through deep engagement with a wide breadth of clients, we know that a hybrid cloud approach on average creates 2.5 times more value for enterprises than a public cloud-alone strategy, and IBM leads in delivering better return on investment (ROI) through hybrid cloud. This higher ROI comes from enhanced business acceleration, developer productivity, infrastructure cost efficiency and regulatory compliance and security. 

We have built a hybrid cloud platform, based on open technologies, that allows clients to realize their digital and AI transformations across the applications, data and environments in which they operate. Watson is IBM’s industry leading AI for business, a portfolio of enterprise-ready pre-built applications and tools designed to reduce the costs and hurdles of AI adoption through industry-leading natural language processing, automation and trust in our responsible use of AI. Building on our hybrid cloud platform, our software collects and analyzes data from across our clients’ enterprises, training our AI to provide insights into their business processes. These insights enable intelligent workflows, reinventing the way businesses operate and driving improved business outcomes that accelerate our clients’ adoption of AI. 

Trust is a key differentiator for IBM’s AI, and of paramount importance to our clients. In a recent survey, 76 percent of AI professionals said being able to trust their AI’s output is fair, safe and reliable is “critically” or “very” important to their business. That is why we believe that AI must be transparent and explainable, and that data and insights belong to the creator. In keeping with this belief, we have designed hybrid cloud and AI solutions that give our clients sole control of their encryption keys. Our homomorphic encryption takes data privacy and security one step further, allowing data to be processed without decryption. 

We have pivoted all of IBM to deliver on this hybrid cloud and AI value for our clients. We believe we have the portfolio that will support IBM’s success as well our clients’ and ecosystem partners’ success. It includes the services capabilities that drive consumption of our technology and enable digital transformation, our software portfolio that can achieve transformational business outcomes through AI and automation, and our systems and infrastructure that can run this platform for mission critical applications.

IBM’s Technology Stack and Platform Approach

IBM offers clients a full technology stack that meets them wherever they are on their journey, from their existing IT infrastructure to our hybrid cloud platform to our cloud-native software to our services professionals who can advise on custom solutions that create the most value for our clients. Our ecosystem partners enhance the client experience and innovation that can be derived from IBM technology. 

Our hybrid cloud approach is platform-centric, with Linux, containers and Kubernetes as the architectural foundation. Platforms provide compelling economics: every $1 of platform spend on average drives $3 to $5 of software revenue, $6 to $8 of services and $1 to $2 of enterprise infrastructure. The multiplier effect of our technology stack creates more value for IBM and our growing ecosystem of partners. 

Hybrid cloud platforms and software comprise a $450 billion market opportunity and are the key to any hybrid cloud architecture. 

Red Hat OpenShift is the leading hybrid cloud software platform, and the only one that is fully integrated and open source, with built-in development, security and operations features. It takes advantage of an ecosystem of millions of developers to accelerate innovation. Leveraging the power of Kubernetes and containers, OpenShift creates the foundation that allows our clients to manage siloed, multi-cloud, edge and legacy infrastructure as a single platform. These capabilities are a clear differentiator, enabling our clients to “write once, deploy anywhere” for their hybrid architecture. We are seeing strong momentum, with more than 2,800 clients using our hybrid cloud platform at the end of 2020.

Cloud Paks are IBM’s containerized, modernized software built to extend the value of OpenShift. They are key to realizing value through digital transformation in four important ways. They help our clients to modernize applications to take advantage of the hybrid platform, automate processes for speed and efficiency, use the power of AI for data driven decision-making and prediction, and secure the entire platform from the data center to the edge. Cloud Paks provide a powerful addition to IBM’s traditional middleware. Our traditional middleware is an industry standard that creates tremendous value for our clients through connectivity on all kinds of systems and gives IBM a leadership position in the market.

IBM’s software enables solutions that can transform businesses. It is the software that solves industry or business-specific problems such as supply chain or asset management and uses our breakthrough natural language processing and automation capabilities as well as other technologies including analytics, encryption, blockchain and machine learning. IBM Research continues to advance these technologies, for example integrating neural and symbolic techniques to build AI that can perform more complex tasks by understanding and reasoning more like humans. 

Business transformation and hybrid cloud services provide a $300 billion market opportunity. Key to how our technology is delivered, IBM Global Business Services (GBS) is a leading design, consulting and systems integration organization, with more OpenShift certified experts than any of the competition. They are the leaders in helping enterprises move workloads onto OpenShift – the top hybrid cloud platform – and have built or migrated hybrid cloud applications for more than 500 clients.

​

Our consultants have the trust of clients around the world, many having worked in the same industries as the clients they serve. Our services professionals bring that deep knowledge to helping clients develop their hybrid cloud infrastructure, applying the full range of IBM’s and its partners’ capabilities to build intelligent workflows enabled by our technology stack. GBS works with our ecosystem partners and IBM developers to create the custom solutions that realize digital transformation for our clients in any country and any industry.

Infrastructure, a $230 billion market, is at the base of our stack, incorporating the public and private cloud technology that integrates with our hybrid cloud approach. 

Our clients are using a combination of public and private cloud infrastructure to keep their mission-critical data and workloads secure. IBM provides both in a way that can easily be slotted into our hybrid cloud platform and AI. IBM public cloud is the technology behind our clouds for highly regulated industries, such as IBM Cloud for Financial Services and IBM Cloud for Telecommunications, with industry-specific security and compliance features. To help clients integrate their private clouds into a hybrid cloud strategy using IBM IT infrastructure, we have made investments in our IBM Z, LinuxONE, Power and Storage offerings to support our hybrid cloud platform and software.

Investing in the Future

Investment in future technologies is an important part of our strategy. Hybrid cloud and AI are the technologies of today, but IBM’s investment in quantum computing positions us to win in the next era of computing. We were the first technology company to publish plans to produce a quantum processor with more than 1,000 qubits by 2023 giving us a significant first mover advantage. 

We already have more than 285,000 registered users in our market-leading quantum network. The 130+ members of the IBM Q Network – including universities, banks, auto companies, telcos and a wide array of companies from other industries – have run over 500 billion quantum circuits.

IBM Research continues to develop new technologies and improve on our existing ones, ensuring that IBM stays in the vanguard of technological innovation that helps enterprises achieve their digital transformations.

Aligning Structure to Strategy

As we focus our strategy on hybrid cloud and AI, IBM is making it easier for our clients to consume our technology and gain better access to our deep technical expertise. 

We are adjusting our portfolio to align to our strategy. The announced spin-off of our managed infrastructure services business will better align IBM to our hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy and create clearer focus for both companies. With over 4,600 technology-intensive, highly regulated clients in 115 countries and more than twice the scale of its nearest competitor, NewCo will pursue a $500 billion market opportunity in managed infrastructure services.

At the same time, we continue to invest organically and inorganically. The acquisitions we announced in 2020 extend our hybrid cloud and AI technology and services capabilities to provide value for our clients. 

We are changing the way we go to market to simplify our client segmentation and better align IBM’s salesforce with our clients so that we more consistently deliver the value of our platform. We will demonstrate the value of our hybrid cloud and AI approach through technical and experiential selling. IBM Garage, a market-leading immersive experience for co-creating solutions, helps our clients and partners grasp the value of the platform by seeing it in practice.

We are expanding our ecosystem by adding hundreds of new global systems integrators, independent software vendors and major third-party software partners. We are investing $1 billion in our ecosystem to ensure that our partners have the resources they need to develop software and build their businesses on our platform expanding IBM’s go-to-market reach. 

When our partners succeed, our clients succeed, and that translates to success for IBM. Our hybrid cloud and AI strategy is designed for our mutual success. It is the engine to propel growth across our entire business, enhanced by a revised sales strategy, ecosystem priority and go-to-market approach. The focus of 2021 will be to accelerate that engine.

Global Financing

Global Financing encompasses two primary businesses: financing, primarily conducted through IBM Credit LLC (IBM Credit), and remanufacturing and remarketing. IBM Credit, a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM, facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of information technology systems, software and services through its financing solutions. The financing arrangements are predominantly for products or services that are critical to the end users’ business operations and support IBM’s hybrid cloud platform and AI strategy. Global Financing conducts a comprehensive credit evaluation of its clients prior to extending financing. As a captive financier, Global Financing has the benefit of both deep knowledge of its client base and a clear insight into the products and services financed. These factors allow the business to effectively manage two of the major risks associated with financing, credit and residual value, while generating

strong returns on equity. Global Financing also maintains a long-term partnership with IBM’s clients through various stages of the IT asset life cycle–from initial purchase and technology upgrades to asset disposition decisions.

Global Financing comprises the following business areas:

Client Financing: lease, installment payment plan and loan financing to end users and internal clients for terms up to seven years. Assets financed are primarily new and used IT hardware, software and services where we have expertise. Internal financing is predominantly in support of Global Technology Services’ long-term client service contracts. All internal financing arrangements are at arm’s-length rates and are based upon market conditions.

Commercial Financing: short-term working capital financing to suppliers, distributors and resellers primarily of IBM products. In 2019, we wound down the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) IT portion of our commercial financing operations. In the fourth-quarter 2020, Global Financing expanded its financial flexibility by entering into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3 billion of its IBM commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis over the agreement’s three-year term.

Remanufacturing and Remarketing: assets include used equipment returned from lease transactions, or used and surplus equipment acquired internally or externally. These assets may be refurbished or upgraded, and sold or leased to new or existing clients both externally and internally. Externally remarketed equipment revenue represents sales or leases to clients and resellers. Internally remarketed equipment revenue primarily represents used equipment that is sold internally to Global Technology Services. Systems may also sell the equipment that it purchases from Global Financing to external clients.

IBM Worldwide Organizations

The following worldwide organizations play key roles in IBM’s delivery of value to its clients:

•Global Markets

•Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Global Markets

IBM operates in more than 175 countries with a broad distribution of revenue. To manage this global footprint, Global Markets leads our dedicated country-based IBM operations in order to serve clients, develop markets, and ultimately, ensure IBM is led through a client lens.

These teams serve our clients locally, complemented by digital capabilities, global talent and resources, and an extensive partner ecosystem. These country teams have client leaders, IBM consultants, solution specialists, delivery professionals and business partners all working on behalf of clients. Their mission is to provide insights and innovation and co-create with clients to help them address their most pressing business challenges and opportunities.

In this way, we serve as a trusted partner to clients, establishing and maintaining relationships that deliver long-term value based on industry expertise, innovative technologies and an ability to deliver mission critical capabilities to an enterprise at scale.

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Our research and development (R&D) operations differentiate us from our competitors. In 2020, we invested approximately 9 percent of total revenue for R&D, focusing on high-growth, high-value opportunities. IBM Research works with clients and our business units through global labs on near-and mid-term innovations. It delivers many new technologies to our portfolio every year and helps clients address their most difficult challenges. IBM Research scientists are conducting pioneering work in hybrid cloud, AI, quantum computing, security, systems and more–applying these technologies across industries including financial services, healthcare, automotive, pharmaceuticals and energy.

We actively continue to seek IP protection for our innovations. Some of our technological breakthroughs are used exclusively in IBM products, while others are licensed and may be used in IBM products and/or the products of the licensee. As part of our business model, we license certain of our IP assets, which constitute high-value technology, but may be applicable in more mature markets. While our various proprietary IP rights are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. In addition, IBM owns or is licensed under a number of third-party patents, which vary in duration, relating to its products.

Human Capital

Employees and Related Workforce[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*

The complementary workforce is an approximation of equivalent full-time employees hired under temporary, part-time and limited-term employment arrangements to meet specific business needs in a flexible and cost-effective manner.

​

As a globally integrated enterprise, IBM operates in more than 175 countries and is continuing to shift our business to the higher value segments of enterprise IT. Our global workforce is highly skilled, reflective of the work we do for our clients’ digital transformations and in support of their mission-critical operations. Our global workforce includes developers, consultants, client delivery and services specialists, research scientists and others. Our employees are among the world’s leading experts in cloud, AI, quantum computing, cybersecurity and industry-specific solutions.

Talent and Culture 

IBM attracts, develops, engages and retains talent in a dynamic and competitive environment. IBM offers a compelling employee value proposition: we develop and deliver innovative technologies including hybrid cloud, AI, and quantum, for clients whose businesses the world relies on. IBM is continuously transforming and developing its talent, both through learning and hiring. In 2020, more than 30,000 people from 75 countries joined IBM. Employees are encouraged and enabled to learn and grow their careers, with employees completing more than 80 hours of learning on average in 2020. Our digital learning platform, Your Learning, uses Watson AI to generate personalized recommendations and includes peer-to-peer collaboration and internal social sharing. Hundreds of thousands of employees globally participate in our annual engagement survey, which measures elements such as workplace experience, inclusion, pride and propensity to recommend IBM as an employer. Our industry-leading talent practices enabled IBM to improve employee engagement by more than 2 points year to year and retain employees above historical levels. Every manager and leader in IBM has access to their team and organization engagement levels along with actionable data-driven insights. 

Diversity and Inclusion

IBM has a long, proud history as a pioneer in diversity and inclusion. A diverse and inclusive workplace leads to greater innovation, agility, performance and engagement, enabling both business growth and societal impact. We ensure employees from diverse backgrounds are engaged, can be their authentic selves, build skills and achieve their greatest potential. With the full support of our Board of Directors, beginning in April 2021 we will disclose annually an overview of our diversity, pay equity and inclusion efforts and programs, including diversity representation data. We are proud of our inclusive culture, with nine out of ten employees responding that they can be their authentic selves at work. Our focus on creating a diverse and inclusive workplace led to increased engagement levels for women, Black and Hispanic employees. We are also focused on meeting or exceeding the diversity of skilled talent in the labor market, for every underrepresented group, and at every level of our company. Women now make up more than 33 percent of our workforce, and we increased representation of women, Black and Hispanic employees in 2020 compared to the prior year. While we have taken significant actions and made progress, we have ongoing work to do. IBM believes in pay equity: we have had an equal pay policy since 1935 and a long-standing practice of maintaining pay equity. To this end, we conduct statistical pay equity analysis that includes all countries with IBM employees. We also empower employees to understand their pay by providing comprehensive education and transparent access to pay statements including a comparison to market pay ranges.

Health, Safety and Well-Being

We have a long-standing commitment to the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Never has this been more important than in 2020 as we faced the COVID-19 pandemic. From early in the course of the outbreak, we supported the health, safety and well-being of our employees by restricting travel, cancelling in-person meetings and events and transitioning nearly 95 percent of our workforce to work from home. We have a robust case management system to manage COVID-19 exposures and a comprehensive playbook on workplace health and safety measures that allow our offices to reopen when conditions improve. Employees are supported with 24/7 access to IBM’s world-class Health and Safety team, education, timely updates and forums to ask questions and raise concerns. 

Additionally, from the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, IBM has focused on mental health and supporting our employees for the long run with programs shaped by frequent survey polls and employee input sessions. Such programs include: four weeks additional paid time off for working parents and caregivers facing disruption, robust case management through our Employee Assistance Program to manage COVID-19 exposures and develop comprehensive guidance, training for employees on resilience and for managers on how to identify and address mental health issues and financial counseling offerings tailored to pandemic-related matters.

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

** Red Hat was acquired on July 9, 2019. Results in 2020 include a full year of Red Hat revenue.

​

Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue of $23,376 million increased 2.1 percent as reported (2 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. There was strong growth in Cloud & Data Platforms, as reported and at constant currency, driven primarily by Red Hat, as our hybrid cloud and AI solutions are resonating with clients. Both Cognitive Applications and Transaction Processing Platforms revenue decreased year to year as reported and adjusted for currency, driven by declines in transactional software performance as clients delayed longer term commitments in the current environment.

Cloud & Data Platforms revenue of $11,481 million increased 20.9 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, driven by a full year of Red Hat revenue contribution and Red Hat’s strong performance in infrastructure and application development and emerging technologies. Red Hat OpenShift, the leading open source hybrid cloud platform, helped clients modernize mission-critical workloads, build cloud native applications, and deploy and manage data and applications across various clouds within an environment that is open, flexible and secure. We now have more than 2,800 clients using our hybrid cloud platform, which is an increase of more than 1,000 new enterprise clients since the acquisition of Red Hat in July 2019.

​

Cognitive Applications revenue of $5,290 million decreased 3.0 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. We had good client adoption in security solutions such as Cloud Pak for Security and growth in security services as clients focused on their secure digital transformations. This growth was offset by declines in solutions used by some of the more impacted industries in the current macroeconomic environment, where clients deferred transformational investments to focus on their core operations.

Transaction Processing Platforms revenue of $6,606 million decreased 16.8 percent as reported (17 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. With the macroeconomic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clients focused on near-term priorities resulting in purchase deferrals, which impacted our transactional software performance in 2020. However, our subscription and support revenue grew in 2020 compared to the prior year.

Within Cloud & Cognitive Software, cloud revenue of $7.0 billion grew 67 percent as reported and adjusted for currency year to year.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

​

The Cloud & Cognitive Software gross profit margin increased 0.4 points to 77.5 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year. The gross profit margin expansion was driven primarily by the full-year contribution from Red Hat and year-to-year improvement in services margins as we continued to focus on shifting to higher value services, such as Software-as-a-Service and security services, and driving AI-powered automation across the portfolio. Pre-tax income of $6,362 million decreased 18.5 percent compared to the prior year with a pre-tax margin decline of 6.4 points to 24.0 percent. The decline in pre-tax income and margin was driven primarily by the revenue decline in Transaction Processing Platforms, our continued investment in our strategic areas of cloud and AI, and the impact of higher workforce rebalancing charges year-to-year which had 2.6 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Global Business Services[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

GBS revenue of $16,162 million decreased 3.8 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. As the global pandemic intensified through the year, we aligned our offerings to help clients focus on engaging customers virtually, modernizing and migrating applications to the cloud, empowering a remote workforce, and focusing on cybersecurity and IT resiliency. In 2020, GBS accelerated the number of engagements using Red Hat technology and continued to drive client adoption of Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks.

Consulting revenue of $8,083 million decreased 0.9 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Given the macroeconomic environment during 2020, clients shifted priorities, which led to project delays and less demand for more discretionary offerings. As we pivoted our offerings and capabilities to help address clients’ priorities around application modernization, our GBS Consulting total signings grew for the year at a mid-single digit rate compared to 2019.

Application Management revenue of $7,133 million decreased 6.7 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by the decline in our more traditional on-premise application management services, partially offset by growth in higher value offerings to develop, modernize and manage cloud applications. Our incumbency in Application Management creates the opportunity and trust to be the partner of choice for our clients’ digital journeys, and helps drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform.

Global Process Services revenue of $945 million decreased 5.0 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting the impact of the ongoing macroeconomic environment on volume-based services. GPS returned to growth in the fourth quarter of 2020,

as we continued to deliver efficiency and flexibility to our clients’ processes by infusing innovative technology and redesigning intelligent workflows.

Within GBS, cloud revenue of $5.8 billion grew 11 percent as reported and adjusted for currency. GBS continued to drive the adoption of our hybrid cloud platform to help our clients accelerate their digital reinventions by modernizing their application infrastructures and leveraging business transformation services built on hybrid cloud.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Recast to reflect segment changes.

The GBS gross profit margin increased 2.0 points to 29.7 percent compared to the prior year, driven by margin improvements across all three areas of the business. The gross margin expansion reflects our shift to higher-value offerings, improved productivity and operational efficiency created by our investments in innovative delivery capabilities and our ability to leverage our variable and global delivery resource model. Pre-tax income of $1,351 million decreased 16.8 percent compared to the prior year and the pre-tax margin declined 1.2 points to 8.3 percent. The year-to-year declines in pre-tax income and margin were driven by the higher workforce rebalancing charges year to year, which had 2.6 points of impact to pre-tax margin, partially offset by the gross margin expansion.

Global Technology Services[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

GTS revenue of $25,812 million decreased 5.7 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020 compared to the prior year. The revenue decline was driven by lower client business volumes primarily with clients in industries more impacted by the macroeconomic environment. However, cloud revenue grew as reported and adjusted for currency in 2020 compared to the prior year. We had strong contract renewals and added a number of new clients in the fourth quarter.

Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue of $19,669 million decreased 5.1 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year. Revenue was impacted by lower client-based business volumes year to year in the more economically sensitive industries. Clients took a longer-term view, with a focus on modernizing their core infrastructure to create operational efficiency and move their mission-critical workloads to a hybrid cloud platform. These clients turn to GTS’s managed infrastructure services with its deep expertise in managing clients’ mission-critical infrastructures and next generation service delivery capabilities infused with AI and automation. As we prepare to separate our managed infrastructure services business in 2021, we are deeply engaged with our clients to ensure a smooth transition to NewCo, the world’s leading provider of infrastructure services.

Technology Support Services (TSS) revenue of $6,144 million decreased 7.3 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) in 2020, driven primarily by the Systems hardware product cycles and a shift away from lower value services.

Within GTS, cloud revenue of $9.4 billion grew 10 percent as reported and adjusted for currency.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The GTS gross profit margin of 34.8 percent was flat compared to the prior year. We had margin improvement across the portfolio from the benefits of workforce rebalancing actions taken earlier in the year and from the shift to higher-value business, partially offset by revenue declines in TSS. Pre-tax income of $117 million decreased 92.9 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 5.3 points year to year to 0.4 percent, reflecting the higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the current year, which had 4.2 points of impact on the pre-tax margin. A significant portion of the structural actions in the fourth quarter of 2020 impacted GTS in order to further improve margins and the overall financial profile of the business.

Services Backlog and Signings[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The estimated total services backlog at December 31, 2020 was $111 billion, a decrease of 1.5 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency).

Total services backlog includes Infrastructure & Cloud Services, Security Services, Consulting, Global Process Services, Application Management and TSS. Total backlog is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract which is either noncancellable, or which historically has very low likelihood of termination, given the criticality of certain services to the company’s clients. Total backlog does not include as-a-Service arrangements that allow for termination under contractual commitment terms. Backlog estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustments for revenue not materialized and adjustments for currency.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Services signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.

Signings include Infrastructure & Cloud Services, Security Services, Consulting, Global Process Services and Application Management contracts. Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Total services signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger contracts, such as in Infrastructure & Cloud Services or Global Process Services. TSS is generally not included in signings as the maintenance contracts tend to be more steady state, where revenues equal renewals. Certain longer-term TSS contracts that have characteristics similar to outsourcing contracts are included in signings.

Contract portfolios purchased in an acquisition are treated as positive backlog adjustments provided those contracts meet the company’s requirements for initial signings. A new signing will be recognized if a new services agreement is signed incidental or coincidental to an acquisition or divestiture.

Management believes that the estimated values of services backlog and signings disclosed herein provide insight into our potential future revenue, which is used by management as a tool to monitor the performance of the business and viewed as useful decision-making information for investors. The conversion of signings and backlog into revenue may vary based on the types of services and

solutions, customer decisions, and as well as other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic environment or external events.

Systems[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Systems revenue of $6,978 million decreased 8.2 percent year to year as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency). Our Systems portfolio continues to deliver critical and lasting value to enterprise clients in support of our hybrid cloud strategy. Systems Hardware revenue of $5,481 million declined 7.4 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by declines in Power Systems and Storage Systems, partially offset by year-to-year growth in IBM Z. Operating Systems Software revenue of $1,497 million declined 11.2 percent as reported (11 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year.

Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue increased 1.9 percent as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency) despite an elongated z15 adoption cycle as a result of the challenging environment. The full-year growth in IBM Z reflects the importance of this high-value, secure and scalable platform with cloud native development capabilities. Our installed base of MIPS is more than 3.5 times the level of a decade ago, with 60 percent of our install base in new workload areas such as Linux.

Power Systems revenue decreased 22.4 percent as reported (23 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, reflecting the product cycles across the Power Systems portfolio.

Storage Systems revenue decreased 6.1 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) year to year, driven primarily by declines in high-end storage which is a reflection of the IBM Z cycle.

Within Systems, cloud revenue of $2.9 billion declined 3 percent as reported and adjusted for currency.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The Systems gross profit margin increased 2.8 points to 55.9 percent in 2020 compared to the prior year, driven primarily by margin improvements in IBM Z and Power Systems, and a mix to IBM Z hardware. Pre-tax income of $449 million declined 36.0 percent and pre-tax margin decreased 2.7 points year to year to 5.8 percent, driven primarily by the higher level of workforce rebalancing charges in the current year, which had 2.5 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Global Financing[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

In 2019, we began the wind down of our OEM Commercial Financing business to refocus our Global Financing business on IBM’s products and services. In 2020, we entered into arrangements to sell certain financing receivables to third parties. While the strategic actions we have taken are the primary driver of the decline in external revenue and pre-tax income on a year-to-year basis, our repositioning of the Global Financing business has strengthened our liquidity position, improved the quality of our portfolio and lowered our debt needs. 

Global Financing total revenue decreased 23.4 percent compared to the prior year. This was due to a decrease in internal revenue of 27.5 percent, driven by decreases in internal used equipment sales (down 22.3 percent to $670 million) and internal financing (down 39.5 percent to $224 million). The decrease in internal financing was due to lower average asset balances and yields. External revenue declined 19.8 percent due to decreases in external financing (down 25.5 percent to $834 million), reflecting the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations and a decline in client financing revenue.

Sales of used equipment represented 47.5 percent and 43.4 percent of Global Financing’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which reflects lower financing revenue compared to 2019. The gross profit margin on used sales was 50.7 percent and 52.2 percent for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Global Financing pre-tax income decreased 27.8 percent year to year primarily driven by a decline in gross profit ($339 million) due to lower revenue, partially offset by a decrease in expense ($46 million), which was in line with the segment’s performance.

Geographic Revenue

In addition to the revenue presentation by reportable segment, we also measure revenue performance on a geographic basis.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Total revenue of $73,620 million in 2020 decreased 4.6 percent year to year as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency and 4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency).

Americas revenue decreased 6.0 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency and 4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). Within North America, the U.S. decreased 4.9 percent and Canada decreased 6.0 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency). Latin America declined 12.9 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). Within Latin America, Brazil declined 17.9 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency).

EMEA revenue decreased 3.3 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency and 4 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency).

Total Expense and Other (Income)[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* Includes a $2.0 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter. 

NM–Not meaningful

Total expense and other (income) year-to-year results for the year ended December 31, 2020 were impacted by the Red Hat acquisition which closed in July 2019. As a result, in the current year, there was a full year of expenses for Red Hat operational spending and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the transaction. The current year also included a fourth-quarter $2.0 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions (primarily workforce rebalancing) to simplify and optimize our operating model.

Total expense and other (income) increased 17.5 percent in 2020 versus the prior year primarily driven by the fourth-quarter charge for workforce rebalancing, higher Red Hat operational spending, lower gains from divestitures and higher non-operating retirement-related costs, partially offset by lower spending including reductions in travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 16.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the factors above excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.

For additional information regarding total expense and other (income) for both expense presentations, see the following analyses by category.

Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 12.1 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors excluding the acquisition-related charges and amortization of acquired intangible assets associated with the Red Hat transaction.

Provisions for expected credit loss expense increased $19.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The receivables provision coverage was 2.4 percent at December 31, 2020, an increase of 70 basis points from December 31, 2019. The higher coverage rate at December 31, 2020 also reflects the adoption of the new guidance for current expected credit losses.

Research, Development and Engineering Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Research, development and engineering (RD&E) expense was 8.6 percent of revenue in 2020 and 7.8 percent of revenue in 2019.

RD&E expense increased 5.7 percent in 2020 versus 2019 primarily driven by:

•Higher spending (7 points) driven by a full year of Red Hat spending in 2020 compared to six months in 2019 (8 points); partially offset by

•Lower acquisition-related charges associated with the Red Hat transaction (1 point).

Operating (non-GAAP) expense increased 6.7 percent year to year primarily driven by Red Hat spending.

Intellectual Property and Custom Development Income[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees decreased 3.3 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. This was primarily due to a decline in licensing of intellectual property including royalty-based fees compared to the prior year. The timing and amount of licensing, sales or other transfers of IP may vary significantly from period to period depending upon the timing of licensing agreements, economic conditions, industry consolidation and the timing of new patents and know-how development.

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

Total consolidated other (income) and expense was expense of $861 million in 2020 compared to income of $968 million in 2019. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:

•Lower gains from divestitures ($733 million) reflected in Other;

•Higher non-operating retirement-related costs ($508 million). Refer to “Retirement-Related Plans” for additional information. 

•Net exchange losses (including derivative instruments) in the current year versus net exchange gains (including derivative instruments) in the prior year ($277 million); and

•Lower interest income ($244 million) driven by lower interest rates and a lower average cash balance in the current year.

Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was $265 million of income in 2020 and decreased $1,167 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by the lower gains from divestitures, effects of currency and lower interest income described above. 

Interest Expense[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Interest expense decreased $56 million compared to 2019. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement only if the related external borrowings are to support the Global Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) in 2020 was $1,738 million, a decrease of $214 million year to year primarily driven by lower average interest rates. 

Operating (non-GAAP) interest expense increased $172 million compared to the prior-year period. The prior year excluded Red Hat pre-closing debt financing costs and the current year included a full year of interest expense associated with the higher level of debt.

Stock-Based Compensation

Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost of $937 million increased $258 million compared to 2019. This was primarily due to increases related to a full year of compensation expense associated with the issuances and conversions of stock-based compensation for Red Hat ($167 million) compared to six months in 2019, and issuances of restricted stock units ($91 million). Stock-based compensation cost, and the year-to-year change, was reflected in the following categories: Cost: $153 million, up $53 million; SG&A expense: $586 million, up $134 million; and RD&E expense: $198 million, up $72 million.

Retirement-Related Plans

The following table provides the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans. Total operating costs/(income) are included in the Consolidated Income Statement within the caption (e.g., Cost, SG&A, RD&E) relating to the job function of the plan participants.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NM–Not meaningful

Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $545 million compared to 2019, primarily driven by lower expected returns on plan assets ($744 million) and an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($467 million), partially offset by lower interest costs ($726 million).

As discussed in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, we characterize certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in 2020 were $1,494 million, an increase of $37 million compared to 2019. Non-operating costs of $1,123 million in 2020 increased $508 million year to year, driven primarily by the same factors as above.

Income Taxes

The continuing operations effective tax rate for 2020 was (18.6) percent compared to 7.2 percent in 2019. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by a net tax benefit of $0.9 billion related to an intra-entity sale of certain of the company’s intellectual property and related impacts in the first quarter of 2020, and a benefit of $0.2 billion related to a foreign tax law change. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate for 2020 was (1.5) percent compared to 8.5 percent in 2019. The current year operating (non-GAAP) benefit from income taxes was primarily driven by the net tax benefit from the intra-entity IP sale. For more information, see note G, “Taxes.”

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and stock awards.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*

The $2.0 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter resulted in an impact of ($1.84) to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations and diluted operating (non-GAAP) earnings per share. The impact to basic earnings per share was ($1.85). 

Actual shares outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 892.7 million and 887.1 million, respectively. The year-to-year increase was primarily the result of the common stock issued under employee plans. The average number of common shares outstanding assuming dilution was 3.8 million shares higher in 2020 versus 2019.

Financial Position

Dynamics

At December 31, 2020, our balance sheet remained strong with flexibility to support the business. We continue to manage the investment portfolio to meet our capital preservation and liquidity objectives. In this unprecedented environment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, while we are supporting our clients and improving the flexibility and competitive position of our operations, we took actions to enhance our balance sheet strength and liquidity position. 

Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities at December 31, 2020 were $14,275 million, an increase of $5,265 million compared to prior year end. Through strategic mitigation actions and re-focus of our Global Financing portfolio, financing receivables declined $4,925 million to $17,979 million as of December 31, 2020. Total debt of $61,538 million decreased $1,361 million from prior year-end. During 2020, we completed bond issuances totaling $8,117 million, with terms ranging from 7 to 30 years, and interest rates ranging from 0.325 to 2.95 percent depending on maturity. We have reduced total debt $11,501 million since the end of the second quarter of 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition). We have consistently generated strong cash flow from operations and continue to have access to additional sources of liquidity through the capital markets and our credit facilities.

During 2020, we generated $18,197 million in cash from operating activities, an increase of $3,426 million compared to 2019. The year-to-year increase was primarily driven by the reduction of financing receivables due to sales of receivables. Our free cash flow for 2020 was $10,805 million, a decrease of $1,104 million compared to the prior year. See pages 57 and 58 for additional information on free cash flow. We returned $5,797 million to shareholders through dividends in 2020. We suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat closing to focus on debt repayment. At 2020 year end, we had $2.0 billion remaining in share repurchase authorization. Our cash generation permits us to invest and deploy capital to areas with the most attractive long-term opportunities.

Consistent with accounting standards, the company remeasured the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans at December 31. At December 31, 2020, the overall net underfunded position was $11,506 million, an increase of $416 million from December 31, 2019, driven by lower discount rates partially offset by strong asset returns. At year end, our qualified defined benefit

plans were well funded and the required contributions related to these plans and multi-employer plans are expected to be approximately $300 million in both 2021 and 2022. In 2020, the return on the U.S. Personal Pension Plan assets was 12.2 percent and the plan was 108 percent funded at December 31, 2020. Overall, global asset returns were 9.6 percent and the qualified defined benefit plans worldwide were 102 percent funded at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, approximately 61 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment-grade clients with no direct exposure to consumers, a decrease of 4 points year to year and an increase of 4 points compared to September 30, 2020. The reduction in investment grade year to year was driven primarily by credit rating changes within the existing portfolio of clients, partially offset by the wind down of OEM IT commercial financing operations. We continue to apply our rigorous credit policies, particularly in industries and countries disrupted by COVID-19, as it relates to the origination of new business. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio and reflects mitigating credit enhancement actions taken by the client to reduce the risk to IBM.

We have a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties, with enhanced focus in this unprecedented environment of the COVID-19 pandemic. These actions may include credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Sales of receivables arrangements are also utilized in the normal course of business as part of the company’s cash and liquidity management.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the company sold $2,562 million of client financing receivables, consisting of loan and lease receivables of $1,410 million and $1,152 million, respectively. 

On December 24, 2020, the company entered into an agreement with a third-party investor to sell up to $3,000 million of IBM short-term commercial financing receivables, at any one time, on a revolving basis. The company sold $515 million of commercial financing receivables under the agreement in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the company included $383 million of commercial financing receivables classified as held for sale at December 31, 2020 in short-term financing receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The reduction of financing receivables due to these sales resulted in a benefit to cash flows from operating activities, however had no impact to free cash flow. The impact to the Consolidated Income Statement, including fees and net gain or loss associated with the transfer of these receivables for the year ended December 31, 2020, was not material. For additional information relating to the sales of financing receivables refer to note K, “Financing Receivables.”

Working capital decreased $1,423 million from the year-end 2019 position. The key changes are described below:

Current assets increased $745 million ($40 million adjusted for currency) due to:

•An increase of $5,265 million ($5,064 million adjusted for currency) in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities; and

•An increase of $536 million ($446 million adjusted for currency) in total inventory, deferred costs and prepaid expenses and other current assets; partially offset by

•A decline in receivables of $5,057 million ($5,469 million adjusted for currency) mainly due to sales of financing receivables, continued focus on collections, including collection of divestiture-related receivables and a decline in revenue.

Current liabilities increased $2,168 million ($1,121 million adjusted for currency) as a result of:

•An increase in other accrued expenses and liabilities of $2,491 million ($1,922 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to the fourth-quarter workforce rebalancing charge; and

•An increase in deferred income of $807 million ($488 million adjusted for currency); and

•An increase in taxes payable of $462 million ($448 million adjusted for currency); partially offset by

•A decrease in short-term debt of $1,615 million ($1,552 million adjusted for currency) due to maturities of $9,165 million; partially offset by reclassifications of $7,998 million from long-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities.

The total IBM receivables provision coverage was 2.4 percent at December 31, 2020, an increase of 60 basis points compared to January 1, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by the overall decline in total receivables and an increase in customer specific provisions. The majority of the write-offs during the year related to receivables which had been previously reserved.

Global Financing Receivables and Allowances

The following table presents external Global Financing receivables excluding immaterial miscellaneous receivables.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Recorded investment excluded residual value.

Upon the adoption of the guidance on current expected credit losses, the percentage of financing receivables reserved increased from 1.0 percent at December 31, 2019, to 1.1 percent January 1, 2020, primarily driven by a 74.2 percent increase in unallocated reserves.

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

The percentage of financing receivables reserved increased from 1.1 percent at January 1, 2020, to 1.4 percent at December 31, 2020, which reflects essentially flat unallocated and specific reserves and an overall decline in financing receivables.

Global Financing’s provision for expected credit losses (including impacts from off-balance sheet commitments which are recorded in other liabilities) was an addition of $34 million in 2020, compared to a release of $7 million in 2019. The increase was primarily driven by higher unallocated and specific reserves in Americas.

Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

The increase in noncurrent assets of $3,039 million ($829 million adjusted for currency) was driven by:

•An increase in deferred taxes of $4,060 million ($3,915 million adjusted for currency) primarily due to the intra-entity sale of IP in the first quarter; and

•An increase in prepaid pension assets of $745 million ($526 million adjusted for currency) driven by higher returns on plan assets and plan remeasurements; partially offset by

•A decrease in long-term financing receivables of $1,626 million ($1,811 million adjusted for currency) as a result of sales of receivables and product cycle dynamics; and

•A decrease in net intangible assets and goodwill of $44 million ($1,283 million adjusted for currency) resulting from intangibles amortization, partially offset by an increase from new acquisitions.

Long-term debt increased $253 million (decreased $1,307 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by:

•Issuances of $8,727 million; partially offset by

•Reclassifications to short-term debt of $7,998 million to reflect upcoming maturities; and

•Redemption of $2,102 million of certain outstanding bonds.

Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) increased $1,621 million ($251 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by:

•An increase in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations of $1,106 million ($297 million adjusted for currency) mainly driven by plan remeasurements; and

•An increase in deferred income of $450 million ($364 million adjusted for currency); partially offset by

•A decrease in operating lease liabilities of $306 million ($424 million adjusted for currency).

Total debt of $61,538 million decreased $1,361 million ($2,859 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2019, primarily driven by early retirements and debt maturities of $11,267 million; partially offset by issuances of $8,982 million. Total debt decreased $11,501 million since the end of the second quarter 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition).

Non-Global Financing debt of $40,371 million increased $2,199 million ($1,046 million adjusting for currency) from December 31, 2019, but has decreased $7,685 million since June 30, 2019.

Global Financing debt of $21,167 million decreased $3,560 million from December 31, 2019 ($3,905 million adjusting for currency), primarily due to lower funding requirements as a result of the decline in financing assets, consistent with the company’s portfolio management strategy.

Global Financing provides financing predominantly for IBM’s external client assets, as well as for assets under contract by other IBM units. These assets, primarily for GTS, generate long-term, stable revenue streams similar to the Global Financing asset portfolio. Based on their attributes, these GTS assets are leveraged with the balance of the Global Financing asset base.

The debt used to fund Global Financing assets is composed of intercompany loans and external debt. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable and are based on arm’s-length pricing. The Global Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9 to 1 at December 31, 2020.

We measure Global Financing as a stand-alone entity, and accordingly, interest expense relating to debt supporting Global Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Global Financing Results of Operations” and in note D, “Segments.” In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Global Financing’s internal financing to IBM is reclassified from cost of financing to interest expense.

Equity

Total equity decreased by $258 million from December 31, 2019, primarily due to dividends paid of $5,797 million and a decline in accumulated other comprehensive income of $740 million mainly due to foreign currency translation adjustments; partially offset by increases from net income of $5,590 million and common stock of $661 million.

Cash Flow

Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page 71 are summarized in the table below. These amounts include the cash flows associated with the Global Financing business.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

Net cash provided by operating activities increased $3,426 million in 2020 driven by the following key factors:

•An increase of cash provided by receivables of $4,795 million primarily driven by sales of receivables, including sales of financing receivables of $3,076 million; and

•Payroll tax and value-added tax payment deferrals and exemptions of approximately $600 million due to tax relief provided under the U.S. CARES Act and other non-U.S. government assistance programs related to COVID-19; partially offset by

•An increase in workforce rebalancing payments of $293 million; 

•A net increase in cash payments for income taxes of $162 million primarily driven by withholding tax on intercompany dividends in the second quarter; and

•Performance-related declines within net income.

Net cash used in investing activities decreased $23,908 million driven by:

•A decrease in net cash used for acquisitions of $32,294 million due to the Red Hat acquisition in the prior year; partially offset by

•A decrease of $6,245 million in cash provided by net non-operating finance receivables primarily driven by the wind down of the OEM IT commercial financing operations;

•An increase in cash used for net purchases of marketable securities and other investments of $896 million;

Snapshot

In the fourth quarter of 2020, we reported $20.4 billion in revenue and income from continuing operations of $1.3 billion, which included a $2.0 billion pre-tax charge for structural actions (primarily workforce rebalancing) to simplify and optimize our operating model. Fourth quarter operating (non-GAAP) earnings were $1.9 billion, which also included the charge for workforce rebalancing. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.41 as reported and $2.07 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $5.9 billion in cash from operations, $6.1 billion in free cash flow and delivered shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in dividends. While challenges related to macroeconomic uncertainty and product cycle dynamics continued, our fourth-quarter results reflect strong performance in hybrid cloud led by Red Hat, gross margin expansion and solid cash generation.

Total consolidated revenue decreased 6.5 percent as reported and 9 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. Excluding divested businesses, revenue was down 6.2 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency. Cloud & Cognitive Software decreased 4.5 percent as reported and 7 percent adjusted for currency. Within this segment, Cloud & Data Platforms grew 8.8 percent (6 percent adjusted for currency) with Red Hat delivering double-digit growth across infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies. Cognitive Applications increased 0.2 percent as reported but decreased 2 percent adjusted for currency and Transaction Processing Platforms decreased 23.8 percent (26 percent adjusted for currency). GBS decreased 2.7 percent as reported and 5 percent adjusted for currency but improved sequentially from the third quarter. Cloud revenue within GBS grew at a double-digit rate and GPS revenue returned to growth in the fourth quarter. GTS decreased 5.5 percent as reported and 8 percent adjusted for currency, with declines in Infrastructure & Cloud Services and Technology Support Services. Systems decreased 17.8 percent as reported and 19 percent adjusted for currency primarily driven by product cycle dynamics. Across the

segments, total IBM cloud revenue of $7.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 grew 10 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) and 8 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency.

From a geographic perspective, Americas revenue decreased 10.5 percent year to year as reported (10 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). EMEA decreased 3.1 percent (8 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency). Asia Pacific declined 2.0 percent year to year as reported (5 percent excluding divested businesses and adjusted for currency).

The consolidated gross margin of 51.7 percent increased 0.7 points year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) gross margin of 52.5 percent increased 0.7 points with margin expansion across software, services and systems. 

Total expense and other (income) increased 29.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus the prior-year period primarily driven by the workforce rebalancing charge, lower gains from divestitures and the impact of currency. These increases were partially offset by lower spending including reduced travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other (income) increased 30.8 percent year to year, driven primarily by the same factors.

Pre-tax income from continuing operations of $1.3 billion decreased 67.7 percent and the pre-tax margin was 6.3 percent, a decrease of 12.0 points versus the prior-year period, primarily due to the workforce rebalancing charge. The continuing operations effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2020 was 1.9 percent compared to an effective tax rate of 8.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income from continuing operations was $1.3 billion, a decrease of 65.5 percent year to year. The net income margin from continuing operations was 6.2 percent, a decrease of 10.6 points from the prior-year period.

Operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income from continuing operations of $2.1 billion decreased 55.8 percent year to year and the operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax margin from continuing operations decreased 11.4 points to 10.2 percent, primarily due to the workforce rebalancing charge. The operating (non-GAAP) effective tax rate from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2020 was 10.4 percent versus 10.5 percent in the prior year. Operating (non-GAAP) income from continuing operations of $1.9 billion decreased 55.8 percent with an operating (non-GAAP) income margin from continuing operations of 9.1 percent, down 10.2 points year to year.

Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.41 in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 65.7 percent and operating (non-GAAP) diluted earnings per share of $2.07 decreased 56.1 percent versus the fourth quarter of 2019.

Cloud & Cognitive Software

Cloud & Cognitive Software revenue of $6,837 million decreased 4.5 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year. The year-to-year decline in our software performance reflects the continued challenging transactional environment due to the macroeconomic environment in the fourth quarter of 2020. Since the fourth quarter is seasonally our largest transactional quarter, this was more impactful than in other quarters in 2020. Additionally, we had strong software performance in the fourth quarter of 2019, the peak in our enterprise license agreement (ELA) cycle, where clients renew, on average, about every three years. With the uncertainty our clients are facing in the current environment, many clients opted for shorter duration ELAs. This dynamic, in combination with the large seasonal volume of ELAs in the fourth quarter, impacted our software revenue performance. We had strong year-to-year renewal rates for subscription and support in the fourth-quarter 2020, reflecting our clients’ commitment to our critical software solutions. We had solid growth in Cloud & Data Platforms led by Red Hat’s continued strong performance. Cognitive Applications grew slightly as reported, but declined adjusted for currency. Transaction Processing Platforms declined as reported and adjusted for currency. We had double-digit growth in total cloud revenue within the segment as reported and adjusted for currency.

In the fourth quarter, Cloud & Data Platforms revenue of $3,373 million increased 8.8 percent as reported (6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior year, reflecting clients’ adoption of our hybrid cloud and AI solutions, including Red Hat and Cloud Paks. Red Hat continued its strong performance with double-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by subscription growth. Red Hat’s strong growth was driven by offerings in infrastructure software and application development and emerging technologies. We are expanding our integration offerings, bringing AI-powered automation across the portfolio through key partnerships and new innovation. We continued to enhance Cloud Pak for Automation, which grew at a strong double-digit rate in the fourth quarter of 2020.

Cognitive Applications revenue of $1,545 million grew 0.2 percent year to year as reported, but declined 2 percent adjusted for currency, with growth in security. The growth in security reflects clients’ interest in our modernized Cloud Pak for Security and services. We had declining performance in solutions concentrated in industries impacted more severely by the current environment, such as TRIRIGA, which is focused on commercial real estate.

Transaction Processing Platforms revenue of $1,919 million decreased 23.8 percent as reported (26 percent adjusted for currency) reflecting our clients’ prioritization of operating expenditures over capital expenditures, which was amplified this quarter, given our strong seasonal mix toward transactional revenue and the ELA dynamics in the fourth-quarter 2020 compared to the prior-year period.

Within Cloud & Cognitive Software, total cloud revenue of $2.2 billion grew 39 percent as reported (36 percent adjusted for currency), which reflects our clients’ demand for our hybrid cloud and AI solutions.

Cloud & Cognitive Software gross profit margin of 79.8 percent increased 0.2 points during the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $1,887 million decreased 30.8 percent compared to the prior year and pre-tax margin decreased 9.8 points to 24.9 percent, driven primarily by the workforce rebalancing charge taken in the fourth-quarter 2020, which had 8.2 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Global Business Services

GBS revenue of $4,170 million decreased 2.7 percent as reported (5 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the prior year, but reflects a sequential year-to-year improvement versus the third-quarter 2020. Total cloud revenue within the segment grew at a double-digit rate year to year, and Global Process Services revenue returned to growth in the fourth-quarter 2020. This growth was offset by declines in Application Management and Consulting. While there remains some market uncertainty, especially in industries more severely impacted by the current environment, our clients are focused on accelerating their digital reinventions by leveraging business transformation services built on hybrid cloud. Our offerings are aligned to this high-value opportunity with a clear focus on reimagining workflows using AI and modernizing the underlying application infrastructures through hybrid cloud. 

Consulting revenue of $2,110 million decreased 0.4 percent as reported (3 percent adjusted for currency). We had continued growth in Cloud Application Development, DevOps and Cloud services such as SAP S/4HANA implementations, offset by declines in on-premise engagements. Consulting signings grew 11 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency) driven by advisory work for application modernization and enabled by our unique and experiential Garage methodology.

Application Management revenue of $1,801 million decreased 6.3 percent as reported (9 percent adjusted for currency), reflecting a continued shift away from traditional on-premise application management services to building and managing our clients’ cloud applications. Our incumbency in Application Management creates an opportunity, and trust, with our clients to be the partner of choice for their digital journey. This incumbency also drives adoption of Red Hat’s hybrid cloud platform. In 2020, our GBS Red Hat engagements accelerated through the year, with 75 new engagements in the fourth quarter. We are continuing this momentum by investing in ecosystems, resources, offerings and skills, and through the acquisitions announced in the fourth-quarter 2020 which will add to our offerings in areas such as cloud development, cloud migration, platform engineering and digital transformation.

Global Process Services (GPS) revenue of $258 million increased 6.2 percent as reported (4 percent adjusted for currency). GPS returned to revenue growth in the fourth-quarter 2020, as we delivered efficiency and flexibility to our clients’ processes through innovative technology and redesign of workflows.

Within GBS, cloud revenue of $1.7 billion grew 16 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) year to year.

GBS fourth-quarter gross profit margin of 30.1 percent increased 2.6 points year to year. Pre-tax income of $148 million decreased 68.5 percent year to year and the pre-tax margin decreased 7.3 points to 3.5 percent. The gross profit margin expansion was driven primarily by improved delivery quality resulting from our investment in innovative delivery capabilities. The decline in pre-tax income and margin reflects the workforce rebalancing charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020, which had 8.8 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Global Technology Services

GTS revenue of $6,568 million decreased 5.5 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). In the fourth quarter, Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue declined as reported and adjusted for currency. We had strong growth in cloud revenue, which was offset by a decline in client business volumes. Technology Support Services revenue declined as reported and adjusted for currency due to Systems’ product cycle dynamics.

Infrastructure & Cloud Services revenue of $5,006 million decreased 5.2 percent as reported (8 percent adjusted for currency). We continued to prioritize high-value opportunities and rescope contracts with our clients to provide long-term value. While these actions impacted our revenue performance this quarter, they contributed to improved gross margin. We had strong contract renewals in the fourth quarter and signed eleven new logo deals. This was one of the strongest new logo signings periods in the last two years and more than doubled the number signed in the fourth quarter of 2019. However, with our announcement in October 2020 of the spin-off of our managed infrastructure services business, some client negotiations were extended, resulting in the delay of some transactions in the fourth quarter. We are working with our clients to ensure a smooth transition to NewCo after the separation and the positive

response we have received from our client outreach demonstrates the confidence our clients have in NewCo’s long-term value proposition to manage and modernize their mission-critical infrastructures. 

Technology Support Services revenue of $1,562 million declined 6.3 percent as reported (7 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by lower services due to Systems product cycles and lower volumes due to hardware consolidation and shift to cloud.

Within GTS, cloud revenue of $2.5 billion grew 4 percent year to year as reported (1 percent adjusted for currency).

GTS gross profit margin of 35.9 percent improved 0.7 points in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the prior-year period. This improvement was driven by the restructuring of certain existing contracts and reduced activity in lower value offerings. GTS reported a pre-tax loss of $353 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to pre-tax income of $645 million in the prior-year period. The pre-tax margin decreased 14.1 points year to year to (5.1) percent. The pre-tax loss and decline in pre-tax margin reflect the workforce rebalancing charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2020, which had 12.5 points of impact on the pre-tax margin. Through these workforce rebalancing actions, we are optimizing the NewCo business to have a leaner and more efficient operating model. 

Systems

Systems revenue of $2,501 million decreased 17.8 percent as reported (19 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. Systems Hardware revenue of $2,077 million decreased 18.8 percent as reported (20 percent adjusted for currency), driven by product cycle dynamics in IBM Z, Power Systems and Storage Systems.

Within Systems Hardware, IBM Z revenue decreased 22.9 percent year to year as reported (24 percent adjusted for currency), compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, which was the first full quarter of shipments of the z15 mainframe. Clients in sectors such as banking and financial markets made purchases early in the cycle to manage through robust market volatility. However, clients in some other industries focused on cash preservation due to the current macroeconomic environment, delayed their purchases elongating the z15 adoption cycle. Our fourth-quarter 2020 performance reflected improved adoption of z15 in some of these industries.

Power Systems revenue declined 14.5 percent as reported (16 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth-quarter 2020 compared to the prior-year period, driven primarily by declines in low-end and high-end systems reflecting the product cycles.

Storage Systems revenue decreased 14.9 percent as reported (17 percent adjusted for currency), driven primarily by declines in high-end storage systems, partially offset by growth in SAN. In the fourth-quarter 2019, we launched the DS8900 high-end system that is tightly integrated with the z15 mainframe, which drove strong performance in the prior-year period.

In the fourth quarter, Operating Systems Software revenue of $423 million decreased 12.1 percent as reported (14 percent adjusted for currency) driven primarily by the IBM Z and Power Systems product cycles.

Within Systems, cloud revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 18 percent as reported (19 percent adjusted for currency) in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.

The Systems gross profit margin increased 3.8 points to 59.9 percent in the fourth-quarter 2020 compared to the prior year. Pre-tax income of $455 million decreased 43.2 percent and the pre-tax margin decreased 7.9 points year to year to 16.9 percent. The gross profit margin expansion was driven primarily by improvements in IBM Z and Power Systems margins, partially offset by a mix within the hardware portfolio. The decline in pre-tax income and margin reflects the workforce rebalancing charge taken in the fourth-quarter 2020, which had 6.0 points of impact on the pre-tax margin.

Global Financing

Global Financing revenue of $286 million decreased 4.8 percent year to year, primarily driven by declines in financing revenue partially offset by an increase in used equipment sales. Global Financing fourth-quarter pre-tax income decreased 22.6 percent to $195 million and the pre-tax margin of 37.6 percent decreased 1.3 points year to year. The decrease in pre-tax income was driven by a decrease in gross profit.

Total expense and other (income) increased 29.9 percent in the fourth quarter with an expense-to-revenue ratio of 45.3 percent compared to 32.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019. The year-to-year increase was primarily driven by the fourth-quarter charge for workforce rebalancing (28 points), lower gains from divestitures (3 points) and the impact of currency (3 points), partially offset by lower spending (4 points) including reduced travel and other expenses associated with COVID-19 restrictions. 

Total operating (non-GAAP) expense and other income increased 30.8 percent year to year primarily driven by the same factors described above.

Cash Flow

We generated $5.9 billion in cash flow from operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $2.4 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily driven by sales of financing receivables of $1.5 billion. Net cash used in investing activities of $0.6 billion was $0.7 billion higher than the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in cash used in acquisitions ($0.3 billion) and lower cash provided by divestitures ($0.2 billion). Net cash used in financing activities of $6.3 billion increased $0.6 billion compared to the prior year, primarily due to higher net reductions in debt.

GBS revenue was flat as reported, but grew adjusted for currency in 2019 compared to the prior year. This performance was driven by strong growth in Consulting led by offerings that enabled each phase of our clients’ digital journey. These offerings included cognitive technology and data platform services, application modernization and next-generation enterprise applications and offerings that use AI to help clients unlock new opportunities and realize productivity improvements. Application Management declined as reported, but was flat adjusted for currency. We had growth in offerings that help clients develop and manage cloud applications and modernize and automate their application portfolio, offset by continued decline in the more traditional application management engagements. GPS revenue decreased year to year as demand shifted away from traditional Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) offerings to new business platforms around intelligent workflows. Within GBS, cloud revenue of $5.2 billion grew 10 percent as reported and 13 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior year. [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

OTHER INFORMATION

Looking Forward

IBM is redefining our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. To accelerate our strategy, we have taken a number of actions that span our portfolio, our operating model and our capital structure. 

On October 8, 2020, we announced our plan to separate the managed infrastructure services unit of our GTS segment into a new public company, currently referred to as NewCo. The separation is expected to be achieved through a U.S. federal tax-free spin-off to IBM shareholders, and be completed by the end of 2021. This creates two industry-leading companies, each with strategic focus and flexibility to capitalize on their respective missions and drive client and shareholder value. Client buying needs for application and infrastructure services are diverging, while adoption of our hybrid cloud platform is accelerating. This change in clients’ needs makes it the right time to create two market-leading companies focused on what they do best. IBM will accelerate our open hybrid cloud platform growth strategy and AI capabilities to drive clients’ digital transformations. NewCo will design, run and modernize the infrastructure of the world’s most important organizations. Both IBM and NewCo will have greater agility to focus on their operating and financial models, have more freedom to partner with others and both will align their investments and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. We remain on track to complete the separation by the end of 2021.

IBM’s focus will be on our open hybrid cloud platform, which represents a $1 trillion market opportunity. We are unlocking the full value of the cloud for clients, further accelerating their digital transformations and adoption of the platform. This platform facilitates the deployment of powerful AI capabilities to enable the power of data, application modernization services and systems. These are all underpinned by the security, unmatched expertise in industry verticals, and deep commitment to open source innovation that clients expect from us. Our approach is platform-centric and differentiated by Red Hat OpenShift, our market-leading open platform, along with a vast software portfolio modernized to run cloud-native and our GBS expertise that drives platform adoption. This platform allows clients to “write-once/run-anywhere,” and enables a hybrid cloud approach that drives up to 2.5 times more value for clients than a public cloud-only solution. Our unique full-stack capabilities and the large ecosystem of partners and global coalition of best of breed independent software vendors we have brought together should accelerate adoption of our platform. Our software portfolio, focused on data and AI, automation, and security, enables the widest access to innovation through open source. Our business, strategy and technology consultants help clients transform by modernizing their existing applications, and by building new AI-infused data analysis capabilities on the leading open hybrid cloud platform. The secure, mission-critical IBM public cloud is designed to provide all required regulatory controls, and offers clients a foundation of open source software, security leadership, and enterprise-grade infrastructure. Our Systems business, integrated with the hybrid cloud platform, allows cloud-native developers to capitalize on the unique capabilities of our hardware. Leveraging our long-term relationships with clients, we will continue to drive the innovation in hardware that enterprises rely on for their most mission-critical computing needs.

NewCo will immediately be the world’s leading managed infrastructure services provider, focused on managing and modernizing client IT environments, a $500 billion market opportunity. It will leverage its unrivaled expertise to offer services and solutions that include resiliency, security and network capabilities to enable high performance of mission-critical systems and services to help clients in their transformation journeys. NewCo will extend its leadership through increased investment in the next generation of transformational managed infrastructure services and be able to partner fully across all cloud vendors, opening new avenues for growth. At the same time, NewCo will maintain a strong strategic partnership with IBM and continue to serve existing and new clients.

We are increasing our investment, both organic and inorganic, in innovation, expertise and ecosystems to drive value through greater focus on our portfolio, our operating model and the needs of our clients. We are investing in platform capabilities, including security and industry-specific clouds. We are continuing to make investments in data and AI, and in technologies like quantum to create future market opportunities, while adding GBS skills and expertise to bring these innovations to market. We announced a new go-to market model in January 2021 to engage our clients in a more technical and experiential way and we are investing $1 billion to expand our ecosystem to broaden our reach and accelerate our platform adoption.

We have also taken actions to enhance our balance sheet strength and liquidity. At December 31, 2020, we had over $14 billion of cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents. We have focused our Global Financing business on IBM’s hybrid cloud and AI offerings. We wound down our OEM Commercial Financing business and entered into an agreement to sell our IBM commercial financing receivables beginning in December 2020. Consistent with our refocused Global Financing strategy and expected capital needs, IBM Credit will no longer require direct access to the public capital markets. As part of IBM’s overall 2021 debt pay down strategy, in the first half of the year IBM Credit will redeem $1.75 billion of outstanding debt and deregister with the SEC.

Looking forward, there is tremendous opportunity for us to help our clients become digital businesses. We continue to take prudent actions to improve our operating model and accelerate our strategic priorities. We are managing for the long-term and are confident in the direction and focus of our business. We expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company with an improving financial profile while maintaining our solid and modestly growing dividend policy.

Our pension plans are well funded. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2020, of which $0.3 billion generally relates to legally required contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. We expect 2021 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $2.9 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2020. This estimate reflects current pension plan assumptions at December 31, 2020. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion, approximately flat versus 2020. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, an increase of approximately $300 million compared to 2020, primarily driven by lower income from expected return on assets.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The company has consistently generated strong cash flow from operations, providing a source of funds ranging between $14.8 billion and $18.2 billion per year over the past three years. The company provides for additional liquidity through several sources: maintaining an adequate cash balance, access to global funding sources, committed global credit facilities and other committed and uncommitted lines of credit worldwide. The following table provides a summary of the major sources of liquidity for the years ended December 31, 2018 through 2020.

Cash Flow and Liquidity Trends[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On July 9, 2019, we closed the acquisition of Red Hat for cash consideration of $34.8 billion. The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from debt issuances. In order to reduce this debt and return to target leverage ratios within a couple of years, we suspended our share repurchase program at the time of the Red Hat acquisition closing. Refer to note P, “Borrowings,” for additional details of financing this transaction.

The indenture governing our debt securities and our various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to 10 percent of IBM’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict our ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on our consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than 2.20 to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $500 million.

We are in compliance with all of our significant debt covenants and provide periodic certification to our lenders. The failure to comply with debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to our debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.

We do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if IBM’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At December 31, 2020, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $627 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of the company’s outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.

The major ratings agencies ratings on our debt securities at December 31, 2020 were as follows:[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

​

IBM has ample financial flexibility, supported by our strong liquidity position and cash flows, to operate at a single A credit rating. Debt levels have decreased $11.5 billion from our peak levels at June 30, 2019 (immediately preceding the Red Hat acquisition) and we will continue to de-leverage throughout 2021 utilizing our debt maturities schedule.

In July 2017, the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Various central bank committees and working groups continue to discuss replacement of benchmark rates, the process for amending existing LIBOR-based contracts, and the potential economic impacts of different alternatives. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative rate for USD LIBOR. SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including risk management, internal operational readiness and monitoring the FASB standard-setting process to address financial reporting issues that might arise in connection with transition from LIBOR to a new benchmark rate. However, it is not expected to have a material impact in the consolidated financial results.

We prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page 71 and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on pages 43 to 44. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different format.

Management uses free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan share repurchase levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Global Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software. A key objective of the Global Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Global Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Global Financing receivables. Free cash flow guidance is derived using an estimate of profit, working capital and operational cash flows. Since we view Global Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, which we seek to maximize, it is not considered when formulating guidance for free cash flow. As a result, we do not estimate a GAAP Net Cash from Operations expectation metric.

From the perspective of how management views cash flow, in 2020, after investing $3.0 billion in capital investments, primarily to scale our cloud infrastructure, we generated free cash flow of $10.8 billion which was down $1.1 billion compared to 2019. Year to year, there were higher capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments from previous actions, offset by improvements in sales cycle working capital and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. In 2020, we continued to return value to shareholders including $5.8 billion in dividends.

IBM’s Board of Directors considers the dividend payment on a quarterly basis. In the second quarter of 2020, the Board of Directors increased the company’s quarterly common stock dividend from $1.62 to $1.63 per share.

The table below represents the way in which management reviews cash flow as previously described.[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

* 143% in 2020 excluding a $2.0 billion pre-tax charge in the fourth quarter for structural actions.

** 111% in 2018 excluding charge of $2.0 billion associated with the enactment of U.S. tax reform.

Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note R, “Commitments & Contingencies.” With respect to pension funding, in 2020, we contributed $211 million to our non-U.S. defined benefit plans compared to $274 million in 2019. As highlighted in the Contractual Obligations table, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. plans of approximately $1.5 billion in the next five years. The 2021 contributions are currently expected to be approximately $300 million. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $2.3 billion in 2021, an increase of approximately $100 million compared to 2020. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or pension plan funding regulations.

In 2021, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.

Our cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities. With our share repurchase program suspended since the close of the Red Hat acquisition, our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our long-standing dividend policy.

Contractual Obligations[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

*

Finance lease obligations are presented on a discounted cash flow basis, whereas operating lease obligations are presented on an undiscounted cash flow basis.

**

As funded status on plans will vary, obligations for mandated minimum pension payments after 2025 could not be reasonably estimated.

È 

 Includes benefits related to a $2.0 billion charge for structural actions in the fourth quarter of 2020, most of which is expected to be paid in 2021.

ÈÈ These amounts represent the liability for unrecognized tax benefits. We estimate that approximately $368 million of the liability is expected to be settled within the next 12 months. The settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the income tax liability cannot be reasonably estimated as the timing of the payments will depend on the progress of tax examinations with the various tax authorities; however, it is not expected to be due within the next 12 months.

Certain contractual obligations reported in the previous table exclude the effects of time value and therefore, may not equal the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Certain noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the previous table as their future cash outflows are uncertain. This includes deferred taxes, derivatives, deferred income, disability benefits and other sundry items. Certain obligations related to our divestitures are included.

Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) we would incur a penalty if the agreement was canceled, or (3) we must make specified minimum payments even if we do not take delivery of the contracted products or services (take-or-pay). If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract is included in the previous table. If the obligation is cancelable, but we would incur a penalty if canceled, the dollar amount of the penalty is included as a purchase obligation. Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment.

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contracts that specify that we will purchase all or a portion of our requirements of a specific product, commodity or service from a supplier or vendor. These contracts are generally entered into in order to secure pricing or other negotiated terms. They do not specify fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased and, therefore, we do not consider them to be purchase obligations.

Interest on floating-rate debt obligations is calculated using the effective interest rate at December 31, 2020, plus the interest rate spread associated with that debt, if any.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

From time to time, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by SEC Financial Reporting Release 67 (FRR-67), “Disclosure in Management’s Discussion and Analysis about Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations.”

At December 31, 2020, we had no such off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. See the table above for our contractual obligations, and note R, “Commitments & Contingencies,” for detailed information about our guarantees, financial commitments and indemnification arrangements. We do not have retained interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or other material off-balance sheet interests or instruments.

Critical Accounting Estimates

The application of GAAP requires IBM to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that directly affect its reported financial condition. The accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to our financial statements. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both (a) the nature of the estimate or 

​ 
60Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

assumption is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact within a reasonable range of outcomes of the estimate and assumption is material to IBM’s financial condition. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of IBM’s Board of Directors. Our significant accounting policies are described in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.”

The inputs into certain of our critical accounting estimates considered the macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. These estimates included but were not limited to, the allowances for credit losses, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets and other long-lived assets, our net investments in sales-type or direct financing leases, valuation allowances for tax assets and revenue recognition. The macroeconomic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material impact on our critical accounting estimates reflected in our 2020 results. Given the inherent uncertainty of the magnitude of future impacts from and/or the duration of the pandemic, our estimates may change materially in future periods.

A quantitative sensitivity analysis is provided where that information is reasonably available, can be reliably estimated and provides material information to investors. The amounts used to assess sensitivity (e.g., 1 percent, 10 percent, etc.) are included to allow users of the Annual Report to understand a general direction cause and effect of changes in the estimates and do not represent management’s predictions of variability. For all of these estimates, it should be noted that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and estimates require regular review and adjustment.

Pension Assumptions

For our defined benefit pension plans, the measurement of the benefit obligation to plan participants and net periodic pension (income)/cost requires the use of certain assumptions, including, among others, estimates of discount rates and expected return on plan assets.

Changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the (gain)/loss amortization and interest cost components of the net periodic pension (income)/cost calculation and the projected benefit obligation (PBO). The discount rate assumption for the IBM Personal Pension Plan (PPP), a U.S.-based defined benefit plan, decreased by 90 basis points to 2.20 percent on December 31, 2020. This change will increase pre-tax income recognized in 2021 by an estimated $48 million. If the discount rate assumption for the PPP had increased by 90 basis points on December 31, 2020, pre-tax income recognized in 2021 would decrease by an estimated $29 million. Further changes in the discount rate assumptions would impact the PBO which, in turn, may impact our funding decisions if the PBO exceeds plan assets. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would cause a corresponding decrease or increase, respectively, in the PPP’s PBO of an estimated $1.3 billion based upon December 31, 2020 data.

The expected long-term return on plan assets assumption is used in calculating the net periodic pension (income)/cost. Expected returns on plan assets are calculated based on the market-related value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets systematically over a five-year period in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost. The differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term return on plan assets are recognized over five years in the expected return on plan assets line in net periodic pension (income)/cost and also as a component of actuarial (gains)/losses, which are recognized over the service lives or life expectancy of the participants, depending on the plan, provided such amounts exceed thresholds which are based upon the benefit obligation or the value of plan assets, as provided by accounting standards.

To the extent the outlook for long-term returns changes such that management changes its expected long-term return on plan assets assumption, each 50 basis point increase or decrease in the expected long-term return on PPP plan assets assumption would have an estimated decrease or increase, respectively, of $240 million on the following year’s pre-tax net periodic pension (income)/cost (based upon the PPP’s plan assets at December 31, 2020 and assuming no contributions are made in 2021).

We may voluntarily make contributions or be required, by law, to make contributions to our pension plans. Actual results that differ from the estimates may result in more or less future IBM funding into the pension plans than is planned by management. Impacts of these types of changes on our pension plans in other countries worldwide would vary depending upon the status of each respective plan.

In addition to the above, we evaluate other pension assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age and mortality, and update these assumptions to reflect experience and expectations for the future. Actual results in any given year can differ from actuarial assumptions because of economic and other factors.

For additional information on our pension plans and the development of these assumptions, see note V, “Retirement-Related Benefits.”

Revenue Recognition

Application of GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires us to make judgments and estimates. Specifically, complex arrangements with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant contract interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting, including whether promised goods and services specified in an arrangement are distinct performance 

​ 
​

​

Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies 61

​

obligations. Other significant judgments include determining whether IBM or a reseller is acting as the principal in a transaction and whether separate contracts should be combined and considered part of one arrangement.

Revenue recognition is also impacted by our ability to determine when a contract is probable of collection and to estimate variable consideration, including, for example, rebates, volume discounts, service-level penalties and performance bonuses. We consider various factors when making these judgments, including a review of specific transactions, historical experience and market and economic conditions. Evaluations are conducted each quarter to assess the adequacy of the estimates. If the estimates were changed by 10 percent in 2020, the impact on net income would have been immaterial.

Costs to Complete Service Contracts

We enter into numerous service contracts through our services businesses. During the contractual period, revenue, cost and profits may be impacted by estimates of the ultimate profitability of each contract, especially contracts for which we use cost-to-cost measures of progress. If at any time these estimates indicate the contract will be unprofitable, the entire estimated loss for the remainder of the contract is recorded immediately in cost. We perform ongoing profitability analyses of these services contracts in order to determine whether the latest estimates require updating. Key factors reviewed to estimate the future costs to complete each contract are future labor costs and product costs and expected productivity efficiencies. Contract loss provisions recorded as a component of other accrued expenses and liabilities were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments are required in determining the consolidated provision for income taxes.

During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, we recognize tax liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes and interest will be due. These tax liabilities are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We believe that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. To the extent that new information becomes available which causes us to change our judgment regarding the adequacy of existing tax liabilities, such changes to tax liabilities will impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

Significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all available evidence for each jurisdiction including past operating results, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies/actions. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made.

The consolidated provision for income taxes will change period to period based on nonrecurring events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors including the geographic mix of income before taxes, state and local taxes and the effects of various global income tax strategies.

To the extent that the provision for income taxes increases/decreases by 1 percent of income from continuing operations before income taxes, consolidated net income would have decreased/improved by $46 million in 2020.

Valuation of Assets

The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to estimate the fair value of assets acquired including separately identifiable intangible assets, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree to properly allocate purchase price consideration. Impairment testing for assets, other than goodwill, requires the allocation of cash flows to those assets or group of assets and if required, an estimate of fair value for the assets or group of assets. Our estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. These valuations require the use of management’s assumptions, which would not reflect unanticipated events and circumstances that may occur.

Valuation of Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. In 2020, we assessed the qualitative risk factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.

​ 
62Management Discussion

International Business Machines Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

We assess qualitative factors in each of our reporting units that carry goodwill including relevant events and circumstances that affect the fair value of reporting units. Examples include, but are not limited to, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, as well as other individual factors such as:

•A loss of key personnel;

•A significant adverse shift in the operating environment of the reporting unit such as unanticipated competition;

•A significant pending litigation;

•A more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of; and

•An adverse action or assessment by a regulator.

We assess these qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. This quantitative test is required only if we conclude that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. After performing the annual goodwill impairment qualitative analysis during the fourth quarter of 2020, the company determined it was not necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test.

Loss Contingencies

We are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings. At least quarterly, we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based only on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation, and may revise our estimates. These revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

Global Financing Receivables Allowance for Credit Losses

The Global Financing business reviews its financing receivables portfolio on a regular basis in order to assess collectibility and records adjustments to the allowance for credit losses at least quarterly. A description of the methods used by management to estimate the amount of uncollectible receivables is included in note A, “Significant Accounting Policies.” Factors that could result in actual receivable losses that are materially different from the estimated reserve include significant changes in the economy, or a sudden change in the economic health of a significant client that represents a concentration in Global Financing’s receivables portfolio.

To the extent that actual collectibility differs from management’s estimates currently provided for by 10 percent, Global Financing’s segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes would be higher or lower by an estimated $26 million depending upon whether the actual collectibility was better or worse, respectively, than the estimates.

Residual Value

Residual value represents the estimated fair value of equipment under lease as of the end of the lease. Residual value estimates can impact the determination of whether a lease is classified as operating, sales-type or direct financing. Global Financing estimates the future fair value of leased equipment by using historical models, analyzing the current market for new and used equipment, and obtaining forward-looking product information such as marketing plans and technological innovations. Residual value estimates are periodically reviewed and “other than temporary” declines in estimated future residual values are recognized upon identification. Anticipated increases in future residual values are not recognized until the equipment is remarketed.

Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimates include significant changes in the used-equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment.

To the extent that actual residual value recovery is lower than management’s estimates by 10 percent, Global Financing’s segment pre-tax income and our income from continuing operations before income taxes for 2020 would have been lower by an estimated $52 million. If the actual residual value recovery is higher than management’s estimates, the increase in income will be realized at the end of lease when the equipment is remarketed.

Currency Rate Fluctuations

Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the U.S. dollar affect our financial results and financial position. At December 31, 2020, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into more dollars than at year-end 2019. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to financing transactions and other foreign currency-based transactions.

During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates. For example, when pricing offerings in the marketplace, we may use some of the advantage from a weakening U.S. dollar to improve our position competitively, and price more aggressively to win the business, essentially passing on a portion of the currency advantage to our customers. Competition will frequently take the same action. Consequently, we believe that some of the currency-based changes in 

​ 
​

​

Management Discussion

​

cost impact the prices charged to clients. We also maintain currency hedging programs for cash management purposes which may temporarily mitigate, but not eliminate, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results.

We translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates. Currency movements impacted our year-to-year revenue and earnings per share growth in 2020. Based on the currency rate movements in 2020, total revenue decreased 4.6 percent as reported and 4.7 percent at constant currency versus 2019. On an income from continuing operations before income taxes basis, these translation impacts offset by the net impact of hedging activities resulted in a theoretical maximum (assuming no pricing or sourcing actions) increase of approximately $280 million in 2020 on an as-reported basis and an increase of approximately $290 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. The same mathematical exercise resulted in an increase of approximately $300 million in 2019 on an as-reported basis and an increase of $260 million on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period, but we believe it could be substantially less than the theoretical maximum given the competitive pressure in the marketplace.

For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to U.S. dollars.

During 2018, the three-year cumulative inflation rates in Argentina, using a combination of monthly indices, exceeded the 100 percent threshold for hyperinflation. As a result, effective July 1, 2018, the company changed the functional currency from local currency to U.S. dollar functional for Argentina with no material impact. In 2019 and 2020, the Argentinean economy continued to experience high inflation. The ongoing impact is not material given the size of the company’s operations in the country (less than 1 percent of total 2020 and 2019 revenue, respectively).

Market Risk

In the normal course of business, our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks. In addition to the market risk associated with interest rate and currency movements on outstanding debt and non-U.S. dollar denominated assets and liabilities, other examples of risk include collectibility of accounts receivable and recoverability of residual values on leased assets.

We regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures. As a result, we do not anticipate any material losses from these risks.

Our debt, in support of the Global Financing business and the geographic breadth of our operations, contains an element of market risk from changes in interest and currency rates. We manage this risk, in part, through the use of a variety of financial instruments including derivatives, as described in note T, “Derivative Financial Instruments.”

To meet disclosure requirements, we perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our debt and other financial instruments.

The financial instruments that are included in the sensitivity analysis are comprised of our cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, short-term and long-term loans, commercial financing and installment payment receivables, investments, long-term and short-term debt and derivative financial instruments. Our derivative financial instruments generally include interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps and forward contracts.

To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates on market-sensitive instruments. The market values for interest and foreign currency exchange risk are computed based on the present value of future cash flows as affected by the changes in rates that are attributable to the market risk being measured. The discount rates used for the present value computations were selected based on market interest and foreign currency exchange rates in effect at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The differences in this comparison are the hypothetical losses associated with each type of risk.

Information provided by the sensitivity analysis does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because, due to practical limitations, all variables other than the specific market risk factor are held constant. In addition, the results of the model are constrained by the fact that certain items are specifically excluded from the analysis, while the financial instruments relating to the financing or hedging of those items are included by definition. Excluded items include short-term and long-term receivables from sales-type and direct financing leases, forecasted foreign currency cash flows and the company’s net investment in foreign operations. As a consequence, reported changes in the values of some of the financial instruments

impacting the results of the sensitivity analysis are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge.

The results of the sensitivity analysis at December 31, 2020 and 2019, are as follows:

Interest Rate Risk

A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the levels of interest rates with all other variables held constant would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of approximately $0.4 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant, would result in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of approximately $1.8 billion and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in the sensitivity of these theoretical changes from the prior year is primarily driven by an increase in Euro denominated long-term debt and a decrease in derivatives used for purchases of foreign currencies.

Financing Risks

See the “Description of Business” on pages 27 to 28 for a discussion of the financing risks associated with the Global Financing business and management’s actions to mitigate such risks.

Cybersecurity

While cybersecurity risk can never be completely eliminated, our approach draws on the depth and breadth of our global capabilities, both in terms of our offerings to clients and our internal approaches to risk management. We offer commercial security solutions that deliver capabilities in areas such as identity and access management, data security, application security, network security and endpoint security. These solutions include pervasive encryption, threat intelligence, analytics, cognitive and artificial intelligence, and forensic capabilities that analyze client security events, yielding insights about attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities facing the client. We also offer professional consulting and technical services solutions for security from assessment and incident response to deployment and resource augmentation. In addition, we offer managed and outsourced security solutions from multiple security operations centers around the world. Finally, security is embedded in a multitude of our products and offerings through secure engineering and operations, and by critical functions (e.g., encryption, access control) in servers, storage, software, services, and other solutions.

From an enterprise perspective, we implement a multi-faceted risk-management approach based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to identify and address cybersecurity risks. In addition, we have established policies and procedures that provide the foundation upon which IBM’s infrastructure and data are managed. We regularly assess and adjust our technical controls and methods to identify and mitigate emerging cybersecurity risks. We use a layered approach with overlapping controls to defend against cybersecurity attacks and threats on networks, end-user devices, servers, applications, data and cloud solutions. We draw heavily on our own commercial security solutions and services to mitigate cybersecurity risks. We also have threat intelligence and security monitoring programs, as well as a global incident response process to respond to cybersecurity threats and attacks. In addition, we utilize a combination of online training, educational tools, videos and other awareness initiatives to foster a culture of security awareness and responsibility among our workforce.

Management Responsibility for Financial Information

Responsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information presented in this Annual Report rests with IBM management. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.

IBM maintains an effective internal control structure. It consists, in part, of organizational arrangements with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation of authority, and comprehensive systems and control procedures. An important element of the control environment is an ongoing internal audit program. Our system also contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies as they are identified.

To assure the effective administration of internal controls, we carefully select and train our employees, develop and disseminate written policies and procedures, provide appropriate communication channels and foster an environment conducive to the effective functioning of controls. We believe that it is essential for the company to conduct its business affairs in accordance with the highest ethical standards, as set forth in the IBM Business Conduct Guidelines. These guidelines, translated into numerous languages, are distributed to employees throughout the world, and reemphasized through internal programs to assure that they are understood and followed.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors is composed solely of independent, non-management directors, and is responsible for recommending to the Board the independent registered public accounting firm to be retained for the coming year, subject to stockholder ratification. The Audit Committee meets regularly and privately with the independent registered public accounting firm, with the company’s internal auditors, as well as with IBM management, to review accounting, auditing, internal control structure and financial reporting matters.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting of the company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.

PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, is retained to audit IBM’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting. Its accompanying report is based on audits conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of International Business Machines Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.

Change in Accounting Principle

As discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.

Basis for Opinions

​

The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

​

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
