PART I

Item 1. Business.

The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. Our products are sold in approximately 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Too Faced, Dr. Jart+, and The Ordinary. We are also the global licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products sold under various designer brand names. Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products.

We believe we are a leader in the beauty industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our excellence in product innovation, our strong position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and “High-Touch” services. We sell our prestige products through distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands, and we provide “High-Touch” consumer experiences across our distribution channels. Our products are sold on our own and authorized retailer websites, on third-party online malls, in stores in airports, in duty-free locations and in our own and authorized freestanding stores. In addition, our products are sold in brick-and-mortar retail stores, including department stores, specialty-multi retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.

Our Brands

Given the personal nature of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes. Each brand has a single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands in the market. Beauty brands are differentiated by numerous factors, including quality, performance, a particular lifestyle, where they are distributed (e.g., prestige or mass) and price point. Below is a chart showing most of the brands that we sell and how we view them based on lifestyle and price point:

4
 Estée Lauder brand products, which have been sold since 1946, have a reputation for innovation, sophistication and superior quality. Estée Lauder is one of the world’s most renowned beauty brands, producing iconic skin care, makeup and fragrances.

 We pioneered the marketing of prestige men’s fragrance, grooming and skin care products with the introduction of Aramis products in 1964.

 Introduced in 1968, Clinique skin care and makeup products are all allergy tested and 100% fragrance free and have been designed to address individual skin types and needs. Clinique also offers select fragrances. The skin care and makeup products are based on the research and related expertise of leading dermatologists.

 Lab Series, introduced in 1987, is a series of high performance, specialized skin care solutions uniquely created to improve the look and feel of men’s skin.

 M·A·C, the leading brand of professional cosmetics, was created in Toronto, Canada. We completed our acquisition of M·A·C in 1998.

 In 2005, we entered into a license agreement to develop and distribute luxury fragrances and beauty products under the Tom Ford brand name, all shaped with Tom Ford’s vision to be the first true luxury brand of the 21st century encompassing fashion, fragrance and accessories. In the same vein as the fashion brand, Tom Ford Beauty exudes seductive modern-day glamour and includes luxury fragrance, color cosmetics, men’s grooming products and skin care products for discerning consumers globally.

 Acquired in 2010, Smashbox Cosmetics is a Los Angeles-based, photo studio-inspired makeup brand with high performance products created for our consumer’s everyday life in the spotlight.

Known as “The Abnormal Beauty Company,” DECIEM is a Toronto-based, vertically integrated multi-brand beauty company rooted in a consumer-focused and functional approach. Its portfolio includes The Ordinary, an ingredient-focused brand, and NIOD, a science-driven skin care brand.

7
 Under exclusive global license arrangements with Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors and Ermenegildo Zegna, we manage a diversified designer fragrance portfolio.

In addition to the brands described above, we manufacture and sell products under the Do The Right Thing brand. In fiscal 2021, we made the decision to exit the global distribution of BECCA products, a makeup brand we acquired in 2016. We expect to substantially complete this exit during fiscal 2022. During fiscal 2021, we ceased global distribution of Prescriptives and Rodin olio lusso products and did not renew the license with Kiton.

From time to time, we also make strategic minority investments in other companies, mainly in the beauty industry. In some cases, we have acquired the remaining interest or a majority interest (e.g., Have & Be Co. Ltd. (i.e. Dr. Jart+) and Deciem Beauty Group Inc., respectively). Our current minority investments include a company based in India that manufactures, markets and sells Ayurvedic skin care and other products under the Forest Essentials brand name, primarily in India.

Our “heritage brands” are Estée Lauder, Clinique and Origins. Our “makeup artist brands” are M·A·C and Bobbi Brown. Our “luxury brands” are La Mer, Jo Malone London, Tom Ford Beauty, AERIN, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle and Kilian Paris. Our “designer fragrances” are sold under the Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, and Ermenegildo Zegna brand names, which we license from their respective owners.

Social Impact and Sustainability

In fiscal 2021, we continued to further integrate social impact and sustainability into our strategy and business operations. Our social impact and sustainability initiatives help drive innovation, growth and efficiency across the business and within our brand portfolio. Areas of focus include climate and energy; packaging; responsible sourcing; ingredient transparency; inclusion, diversity and equity; employee health and safety; and social investments. We have set goals or made commitments for these focus areas. For example, our goals related to climate and energy support efficiency and conservation within our facilities and internal supply chain, and some of these goals are also intended to help us reduce cost and waste. 

Our Nominating and ESG Committee, one of our Board committees, has oversight responsibility for our Company’s environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) activities and practices, including citizenship and sustainability matters. Our social impact and sustainability efforts are led by our Executive Chairman and our President and Chief Executive Officer. Other members of senior management, along with employees across the organization, help to drive our strategic initiatives concerning social impact and sustainability.

Additional information related to our social impact and sustainability matters can be found at www.elcompanies.com.

Distribution

We sell our prestige products through distribution channels that complement the luxury image and prestige status of our brands, and we provide “High-Touch” consumer experiences across our distribution channels. Our products are sold on our own and authorized retailer websites, on third-party online malls, in stores in airports, in duty-free locations and in our own and authorized freestanding stores. In addition, our products are sold in brick-and-mortar retail stores, including department stores, specialty-multi retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas. Our general practice is to accept returns of our products from customers if properly requested and approved.

In fiscal 2021, we were impacted by the dramatic shifts in our distribution landscape and consumer behaviors attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. While we and certain retailers and distributors closed or decreased our presence in a number of existing points of distribution, we also continued to strategically open new points of distribution globally and saw an expansion of online sales globally.

Online, we sell products from most of our brands direct-to-consumer through our brand.com sites and third-party online malls. We also sell our products wholesale to authorized retailers that resell online through retailer.com and pure-play sites. Our sites are in approximately 50 countries. While today a majority of these online sales are generated in mainland China, the United States and the United Kingdom, we continue to expand rapidly in other markets globally.

As of June 30, 2021, we operated approximately 1,600 freestanding stores. The total reflects the net impact during fiscal 2021 of store closures related to the Post-COVID Business Acceleration Program, the decision not to renew leases at certain locations, certain freestanding stores previously operated by authorized third parties that were transitioned to us and existing DECIEM stores due to the increase in our ownership in that company. Most freestanding stores are operated by us under a single brand name, such as M·A·C, Jo Malone London, Aveda, Origins, Le Labo or DECIEM. We also operate over 200 multi-branded company stores in outlet malls. There are also approximately 700 Company-branded freestanding stores around the world operated by authorized third parties, primarily in Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific.

We maintain dedicated sales teams that manage our retail accounts. We have wholly owned operations in over 50 countries, and two controlling interests that operate in several countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products. In certain countries, we sell our products through carefully selected distributors who we believe share our commitment to protecting the image and position of our brands. In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international U.S. military exchanges. For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 22 – Segment Data and Related Information.

Customers

Our strategy is to build strong relationships globally with select retailers, and our senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis in support of these relationships. We believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers. In addition, we connect with our consumers directly through freestanding stores, e-commerce sites and social media to build a robust omnichannel experience that allows a consumer to shop in these and other channels. 

Our largest customer in fiscal 2021 sells products primarily in China travel retail and accounted for 14% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2021, 7% for fiscal 2020 and 5% for fiscal 2019, and 10%, and 24%, of our accounts receivable at June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

Marketing

Our strategy to market and promote our products begins with our well-diversified portfolio of more than 25 distinctive brands across four product categories. Our portfolio can be deployed in multiple distribution channels, key travel corridors and geographies where our global reputation and awareness of our brands benefit us. Our geographic and distribution channel diversity allows us to engage local consumers across an array of developed and emerging markets by emphasizing products and services with the greatest local relevance, inclusiveness and appeal. This strategy is built around “Bringing the Best to Everyone We Touch.” Our founder, Mrs. Estée Lauder, formulated this unique marketing philosophy to provide “High-Touch” service and high-quality products as the foundation for a solid and loyal consumer base. Our “High-Touch” approach is demonstrated through our integrated consumer engagement models that leverage our product specialists and technology to provide the consumer with a distinct and truly personalized experience that can include personal consultations with beauty advisors, in person or online, who demonstrate and educate the consumer on product usage and application. As our business has grown and channel mix has evolved, we have further expanded our marketing philosophy and “High-Touch” execution to build both online and offline personalized consumer experiences through digital and physical demonstration, targeted digital media and tailored trial-to-loyalty pathways. We plan to continue to leverage our core strengths, including the quality of our products, our “High-Touch” consumer engagement and a diversified portfolio of brands, channels and geographies.

Our marketing strategies vary by brand, local market and distribution channel. We have a diverse portfolio of brands, and we employ different engagement models suited to each brand’s equity, distribution, product focus, understanding of the core consumer and local relevance. This enables us to elevate the consumer experience as we attract new consumers, create trial, build loyalty, drive consumer advocacy and address the transformation of consumer shopping behaviors. Hero products are at the core of our brand marketing strategies. They are the pillars of our brands and historically have provided strong results through high repeat sales and consumer loyalty. In addition to continuing to attract existing consumers, our hero products provide an opportunity for new consumers to be introduced to our desirable products, creating consumer traffic across all channels of distribution. We aim to further strengthen our hero products through continuous review of our product portfolio and strategic innovation. Our marketing planning approach leverages local insights to optimize allocation of resources across different media outlets and retail touch points to resonate with our most discerning consumers most effectively. This includes strategically deploying our brands and tailoring product assortments and communications to fit local tastes and preferences in cities and neighborhoods. Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house teams, in collaboration with external resources, that design and produce the sales materials, social media strategies, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand. For a number of products, we create and deploy 360° integrated consumer engagement programs. We build brand equity and drive traffic to retail locations and to our own and authorized retailers’ websites through digital and social media, magazines and newspapers, television, billboards in cities and airports, and direct mail and email. In addition, we seek editorial coverage for our brands and products in digital and social media and print, to drive influencer amplification.

We are increasing our brand awareness and sales through our strategic emphasis on technology, by continuing to elevate our digital presence encompassing e-commerce and m-commerce, as well as digital, social media and influencer marketing. We are investing in new analytical capabilities to promote a more personalized experience across our distribution channels. We continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), support e-commerce and m-commerce businesses via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and “High-Touch” consumer engagement, in order to continue to offer better experiences and services and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online. We also support our authorized retailers to strengthen their e-commerce businesses and drive sales of our brands on their websites. We have opportunities to expand our brand portfolio online around the world, and we continue to invest in new omnichannel concepts in the United States, China and other markets to increase brand loyalty by better serving consumers as they shop across channels and travel corridors. We have dedicated resources to implement creative, coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.

Promotional activities, in-store displays, and online navigation are designed to attract new consumers, build demand and loyalty and introduce existing consumers to other product offerings from the respective brands. Our marketing efforts also benefit from cooperative advertising programs with some retailers, some of which are supported by coordinated promotions, such as sampling programs, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase. Sampling is a key promotional activity as the quality and perceived benefits of sample products are very effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers. Such activities attract consumers and keep existing consumers engaged. Our marketing and sales executives spend considerable time in the field meeting with consumers, retailers, beauty advisors and makeup artists at the points of sale to enable us to offer a seamless experience across channels of distribution.

10
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on consumer behaviors and has accelerated the trend for a digital-first consumer journey and e-commerce. This provided a catalyst for redesigning each brand's “High-Touch” experience and accelerated changes to our direct-to-consumer business models and consumer engagement programs, such as selling through social media and web conferencing platforms (“Virtual Selling”). These models and programs continue to provide distinct one-to-one and one-to-many “High-Touch” omnichannel services and personalized experiences by leveraging technology and our talented beauty advisors, consultants, and makeup artists.

Information Technology

Information technology supports all aspects of our business, including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance. We continue to maintain and enhance our information technology systems in alignment with our long-term strategy. An increasing portion of our global information technology infrastructure is cloud-based. This allows for a more scalable platform to support current and future requirements and improves our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of the business by leveraging more advanced technologies.

We recognize that technology presents opportunities for competitive advantage, and we continue to invest in new capabilities and the use of emerging technologies across various aspects of our business. During fiscal 2021, we responded to shifting consumer and employee behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. We invested in new marketing and consumer engagement capabilities globally with a focus on innovative digital experiences across our omnichannel landscape, as well as enabling productivity of an increasingly remote workforce through new solutions. Our strategy over the next few years includes continuing to build a strong and secure technology infrastructure to adapt to evolving business dynamics, which includes the expansion of our seamless omnichannel capabilities and our Virtual Selling, the creation of more modernized manufacturing and distribution facilities (including upgrades to existing facilities) powered by technology and the utilization of predictive analytics to optimize our supply and demand planning.

Research and Development

We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products. Our research and development group, which includes scientists, engineers, analysts, and other employees involved in product and packaging innovation, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to generate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, create new packaging concepts, and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products. In addition, these research and development personnel provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how to quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver environmentally responsible products that meet or exceed consumer expectations. The research and development group has both long-standing and continually growing research-based working relationships with several U.S. and international dermatology and medical institutions, research universities and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities. Members of the research and development group are also responsible for product safety, registration and regulatory compliance matters. As our business continues to grow globally, and to satisfy the demand for locally relevant consumer products, we have increased our focus on innovation in Asia/Pacific, especially in China, as well as in Japan and Korea. In fiscal 2021, we began construction at a newly leased site that will become our innovation center in Shanghai, as we aim to better meet the needs of consumers through local relevancy with superior capabilities in product and package design and consumer and clinical testing. Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be operational in late fiscal 2022.

Our research and development costs totaled $243 million, $228 million and $202 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are expensed as incurred. As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,000 employees engaged in research and development activities. We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see Item 2. Properties.

11
Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials

We manufacture our products primarily in our own facilities in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada and also leverage global third-party manufacturing networks. We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies, minimize our impact on the environment, ensure supply sufficiency and reduce costs. Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated. In fiscal 2021, we began construction of a new manufacturing facility near Tokyo, which is expected to enable us to better meet demand and increase speed to market in the Asia/Pacific region. Construction is in progress and the facility is expected to be operational in early fiscal 2023. While we believe that our manufacturing network of internal and external sites is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated increased requirements, we continue to implement improvements in capacity, technology, and productivity and align our manufacturing with regional sales demand to be more agile. From time-to-time, demand changes may challenge our capacity for certain subcategories on a short-term basis, but we believe, this will not impact our ability to meet our annual or long-term strategic objectives. 

We have established a flexible global distribution network of logistic providers that are managed by us or third parties. The network is designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels. We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network, particularly as we work to anticipate and respond to channel shifts. We have established regional and local distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers and consumers.

As discussed above, we continue to focus on social impact and sustainability across our operations. Focus areas include employee health and safety and minimizing our impact on the environment. This is achieved, in part, through investment in equipment while enhancing the work environment through safe practices and capabilities. We also engage in initiatives to improve our equipment and buildings to support and deliver our sustainability goals and reduce our impact on the environment. Environmental efforts include waste reduction, zero industrial waste to landfill and investment in renewable energy sources.

The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals. We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications. Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations function. We review our supplier base periodically with the specific objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation and speed-to-market, ensuring supply sufficiency and reducing costs. In addition, we focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies, lead-time reduction and reduced carbon footprint. 

Some of our products rely on single-source or a limited number of suppliers; however, we believe we have a robust business continuity strategy, sophisticated capacity planning tools and strategic inventory buffer and multi-sourcing solutions. In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and packaging components for virtually all materials used in the production of our products. We currently believe we have adequate resources of supply and that our portfolio of suppliers has the resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.

We are continually benchmarking the performance of our supply chain, and we augment our supply base and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing plants and networks based upon the changing needs of the business. As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.

As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have leveraged our network of global supply, manufacturing and distribution, to help mitigate disruption to our supply chain and help enable our return to normal operations. By the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2021, and throughout fiscal 2021, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities were operating at sufficient levels.

12
Competition

There is significant competition within each market where our skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products are sold. Brand recognition, product quality and effectiveness, distribution channels, accessibility, and price point are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands. Marketing, merchandising, in-store and online experiences and demonstrations, and new product innovations also have an impact on consumers’ purchasing decisions. There continues to be increased interest and awareness from our customers and consumers in environmentally sustainable products, and we believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the resulting change in consumer preferences due to our social impact and sustainability efforts. With our portfolio of diverse brands sold in a variety of channels, we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers, marketers and sellers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.

We compete against a number of global and local companies. Some of our competitors are large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names. Our competitors include L’Oreal S.A.; Unilever; Procter & Gamble; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; L Brands; Natura & Co.; Beiersdorf; LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Chanel S.A.; Kao Corp; and LG Household & Health Care. We also face competition from a number of independent brands, some of which are backed by private-equity investors, as well as some retailers that have their own beauty brands. Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.

Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights

We own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M·A·C, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, Kilian Paris, Too Faced, Dr. Jart+, DECIEM and The Ordinary and the names of many of the products sold under these brands. We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Dr. Andrew Weil, Ermenegildo Zegna and AERIN. For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – License Arrangements. We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide. We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.

A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology. In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights. While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.

Human Capital 

We strive to operate responsibly and to build a sustainable business based on uncompromising ethics, integrity, fairness, diversity and trust, consistent with our Company values. We view human capital management and the strength of our employees as integral to the long-term success and resilience of our business. Our human capital management includes the following strategic areas, each of which is discussed further below:

•Inclusion, Diversity and Equity - Fostering an inclusive, diverse and equitable culture that provides our employees with personal and professional development opportunities, which helps to attract and retain the best talent and drive long-term growth.

•Talent Recruitment, Retention, Learning and Development - Affording our employees learning opportunities to drive career development and enhance innovation, which helps to create strong and sustainable leadership across the organization and support ongoing development of new products and services. 

•Health and Safety - Striving to provide a healthy and safe workplace for our employees, which we believe also enhances productivity.

•Employee Rewards - Offering competitive compensation and benefit packages to support our employees’ physical, mental and financial well-being, which helps us attract, incentivize and retain world-class talent.

•Volunteerism and Community Engagement - Supporting volunteer efforts by our employees because our long-term success is closely tied to the vitality of the communities where we have a presence.

13
Our Board of Directors and its committees provide oversight to management on a wide range of human capital matters, including inclusion and diversity, health and safety, pay equity and compensation and benefits. We had approximately 62,000 and 75,000 employees worldwide, including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us, as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fiscal 2021 reduction in employees was driven primarily by fewer point of sale employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a combination of door closures and on-going in-store capacity restrictions, decisions to reduce the number of on-call and temporary employees, and voluntary resignations. At June 30, 2021, approximately 72% of our global employees were full-time, approximately 15% were temporary and approximately 13% were part-time employees, with approximately 30% of our global employees located in the United States and approximately 70% located outside of the United States. We recognize the importance of female representation, and, as of June 30, 2021, approximately 82% of our employees were female and approximately 55% of our employees at the level of Vice President and above were female. We have no employees in the United States that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by works council agreements or other syndicate arrangements.

Inclusion, Diversity and Equity

We are committed to supporting an inclusive and diverse workplace that better enables us to create innovative products and services as we continually strive to meet the evolving needs of our diverse global consumers. Our objective in creating an environment of inclusion, diversity and equity is to enhance our ability to attract and retain the best talent globally and promote a sense of belonging. We continuously encourage a culture of fairness, equal access to opportunities, including positions of leadership, and transparency in employment matters. We have enhanced our strategy in many areas including hiring, employee engagement, development and talent management to further support inclusion, diversity and equity across the organization. 

We are proud of our history of driving awareness and acceptance around the world and for standing up for the rights of individuals in the workplace and beyond. We have accelerated our efforts to make racial equity a priority by announcing a series of commitments across our business, focusing on U.S. operations. Areas where we have made commitments include programs related to listening and learning, talent and opportunity, representation, suppliers and investing in change. 

We are also committed to gender equity and equitable pay practices. We have a number of programs to help accelerate the development and promotion of women, such as our Women's Leadership Network, and during fiscal 2021, we announced a plan to achieve gender pay equity across the organization.

We continue to prioritize cross-generational inclusion and diversity to help cultivate talent within our workforce. We are committed to various programs to continue our investment at all levels of seniority and tenure, including our Global Reverse Mentor Program that pairs seasoned leaders with more junior talent and was designed to give insights to the leadership team on current millennial and Gen Z habits, preferences and trends.

Talent Recruitment, Retention, Learning and Development 

Hiring, retaining and developing the best talent globally is key to our success in sustaining long-term growth. Our talent strategy is focused on employee engagement and investments in career development, as well as measuring, recognizing and rewarding performance. Our investments include providing programs to ensure our employees are equipped with the right skillsets and knowledge, as well as opportunities to transfer to other functions or regions through short-term and long-term assignments. We believe these programs and opportunities create a pipeline of talent and leadership, necessary to drive and deliver on our long-term strategy.

To enhance our culture and measure our human capital objectives, we regularly engage with our employees. We provide several mechanisms for our employees to provide their feedback, including direct discussions with managers, employee surveys and interactive townhall meetings. Key topics covered during employee engagement include inclusion, diversity and equity, learning and development, work-life structure, and employee benefits. Based on our review of employee survey results, action plans are implemented to enhance employee satisfaction and to ensure alignment with our overall human capital strategy. 

An important element of our talent strategy is succession planning and building leadership at various levels across the organization. We regularly discuss potential successors to key roles, review relevant backgrounds and capabilities and develop succession plans accordingly.

To enhance innovation, productivity and our speed to market, we aim to foster an environment of curiosity and to create a workplace that encourages continuous learning and development. We offer training and development programs that are focused on strengthening leadership and professional skills at various stages of an employee’s career. Our programs are offered through in-person, online or virtual learning experiences.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted and reprioritized our training and development programs and delivery methods to meet the needs of our employees who are working from home. These changes included delivering learning experiences around subject matters such as managing remotely, mental health awareness and building resilience during uncertain times, as well as pivoting traditional in-person sessions to virtual instructor-led learning. In addition, we continue to curate digital content to support “business as usual” focus areas, such as performance development, as well as socially relevant information around racial justice and inclusion and diversity.

Health and Safety

We are committed to providing a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. We establish and update safety policies and procedures, train employees on our safety guidelines and local requirements, and create a culture focused on safety through ongoing communication, awareness and engagement. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented new health and safety protocols and modified a number of our business practices to protect our employees, including allowing our office-based employees to work remotely, imposing restrictions for business travel, and implementing safety measures for on-site employees.

Employee Rewards

We offer compelling and competitive compensation packages with the objectives to attract, motivate and retain world-class talent, and we are committed to fair and equitable pay across the organization. Employee compensation is based on specific circumstances, including role and experience, geographic location and performance. In addition to base pay, we offer annual incentive awards and equity awards for employees at certain job grades. 

To support the health and well-being of our employees, we offer competitive benefit packages that may include pension and post-retirement benefit plans, health and wellness benefits, flexible working arrangements, parental (maternal and paternal) leave, adoption assistance and education-related benefits, which may vary by country. 

In response to the challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed several employee initiatives that were implemented at the global, regional and local levels with the objective to support the physical, mental and financial well-being of our employees.

Volunteerism and Community Engagement 

We are dedicated to being active and respectful citizens, and we engage in philanthropic and employee volunteering efforts to enhance the communities we touch. We are inspired by the generosity of our employees and encourage them to become involved in their communities by offering programs to support the causes that matter to them. To empower employees, ELC Good Works, our global charitable and volunteerism program, allows eligible employees to create and participate in volunteer activities, with their cash donations matched by the Company and volunteer hours rewarded through additional cash donations by the Company.

Government Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold. Such laws and regulations relate to a wide range of matters including ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, advertising, transport and the sale, disposal and safety of our products, as well as environmental matters. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had and is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s capital expenditures, including capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, earnings or competitive position.

Seasonality

Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year. The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by consumers for special events and by retailers for holiday selling seasons. Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions or the particular retail calendars followed by our customers that are retailers, which may impact their order placement and receipt of goods. Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by key shopping events, as well as variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.
