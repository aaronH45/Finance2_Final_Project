Highlights for Year Ended December 31, 2020 

Below are highlights of our performance for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, as applicable, except as otherwise noted.

•Net earnings decreased 63.0% to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by lower net interest income and higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decrease in retailer share arrangements and other expense. These changes were primarily due to the following key factors:

◦impact of COVID-19 on purchase volume and loan receivables at our partners and increases to our allowance for credit losses.

◦the effects from the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio in 2019, including the prior year impact from reductions in reserves of loan losses of $857 million after-tax.

◦increase in provision for credit losses attributable to applying the CECL guidance as compared to the prior accounting guidance of $215 million after-tax.

•We adopted the CECL accounting guidance in January 2020 and recorded an increase to our allowance for credit losses of $3.0 billion. In addition, the increase in provision for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $285 million, or $215 million after-tax, attributable to applying the CECL guidance as compared to the prior accounting guidance.

•Loan receivables decreased 6.1% to $81.9 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower purchase volume and a decrease in average active accounts due to the impact of COVID-19.

•Net interest income decreased 14.3% to $14.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decrease in interest and fees on loans related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense reflecting lower benchmark interest rates.

•Retailer share arrangements decreased 5.5% to $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on program performance.

•Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased 137 basis points to 3.07% at December 31, 2020 from 4.44% at December 31, 2019, and our net charge-off rate decreased 107 basis points to 4.58% for the year ended December 31, 2020.

•Provision for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion, or 27.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the effects of the prior year sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio and a higher reserve build in the current year, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. The higher reserve build reflects the projected impact of COVID-19 and the increase attributable to CECL discussed above. The prior year reductions in reserves for credit losses related to the Walmart consumer portfolio totaled $1.1 billion. Our allowance coverage ratio (allowance for credit losses as a percentage of end of period loan receivables) increased to 12.54% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 6.42% at December 31, 2019, primarily due to the impact of the CECL implementation and impacts from COVID-19.

•Other expense decreased by $190 million, or 4.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the cost reductions related to the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio, lower professional fees, lower purchase volume and average active accounts, and reductions in certain discretionary spend, partially offset by a restructuring charge of $87 million and higher operational losses.

•At December 31, 2020, deposits represented 80% of our total funding sources. Total deposits decreased 3.6% to $62.8 billion at December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019.

•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we declared and paid cash dividends on our Series A 5.625% non-cumulative preferred stock of $56.40 per share, or $42 million.

30

•During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock, and declared and paid cash dividends of $0.88 per common share, or $520 million. In January 2021, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program of up to $1.6 billion through December 31, 2021, beginning in the first quarter, subject to the Company's capital plan, market conditions and other factors, including regulatory restrictions and required approvals, if any.

Business Trends and Conditions

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:

•Growth in loan receivables and interest income. We have experienced significant declines in consumer purchase activity following the outbreak of COVID-19 and associated governmental preventative measures, such as closures of non-essential businesses. Interest and fees on loans decreased 14.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the prior year period. The sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio sale drove a decline compared to the prior year period of approximately 9%. The remaining decrease in interest and fees on loans, along with a decline in loan receivables of 6% and a reduction in purchase volume for our ongoing partners of 2%, in all instances at or for the year ended December 31, 2020, were primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19. In addition, we have experienced a reduction in benchmark interest rates and we have also provided, for a temporary period of time, forbearance in terms of deferrals of minimum payments and waivers of interest and fees for qualifying cardholders that were impacted by COVID-19 and requested relief. The decreases in loan receivables and benchmark interest rates along with the forbearance actions have led to the reductions in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect both loan receivables and interest income, which experienced the most significant adverse effects from COVID-19, to increase in 2021 as compared to the prior year, and also expect to see slowing payment rates and increasing purchase volume in the second half of 2021 which will also contribute to a return to asset growth and increases in interest income. The extent of the impacts from these conditions is currently uncertain and dependent on various factors. These factors include, the nature of and duration for which any preventative measures remain in place, including responses to increases in COVID-19 infections nationally that may occur, the pace of the national rollout of vaccinations and the type and size of any additional stimulus measures and other policy responses that the U.S. government may adopt.

•Asset quality. The COVID-19 pandemic has driven significant improvement in customer payment behavior such that our asset quality metrics have seen historic lows during 2020. Our over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased to 3.07% at December 31, 2020 from 4.44% at December 31, 2019. We anticipate that the current levels of filings for unemployment benefits in the United States will result in an increase from current levels in the Company’s delinquencies and net charge-off rate in 2021. We expect these increases to be partially mitigated by the effects of governmental actions such as the CARES Act, as amended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, as well as any further proposed stimulus in 2021. As such, we anticipate experiencing increases to both delinquencies and net charge-offs to occur in the second half of 2021. During 2020 we also took certain forbearance actions for our customers impacted by COVID-19. While we have experienced a higher incidence rate of accounts becoming delinquent following their exit from these short-term programs, as compared to accounts that did not enter the forbearance program, we do not expect these actions to have a material impact to the Company's overall delinquency metrics. We have also experienced an increase to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 attributable to the impact of COVID-19, and our allowance coverage ratio at December 31, 2020 was 12.54%. As the economic environment develops during 2021, we anticipate that our loan loss reserve builds will be lower than those experienced in 2020. However, to the extent the current environment continues beyond our expectations or deteriorates further, we may experience further increases to our allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses related to COVID-19.

•Retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements. Retailer share arrangements decreased 5.5% to $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on program performance. We believe that the payments we make to our partners under our retailer share arrangements, in the aggregate, in 2021 are likely to decrease in absolute terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the performance of our programs, which would reflect the expected credit trends discussed above. This decrease will be partially offset by growth of the programs. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Retailer Share Arrangements for additional information on these agreements.

35

•Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements. Our Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years, and the average length of our relationship with our Retail Card partners is 23 years. We expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis. 

A total of 14 of our 25 ongoing Retail Card program agreements have an expiration date in 2025 or beyond. These 14 program agreements represented in the aggregate 87% and 88% of our Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2020 and of our Retail Card loan receivables at December 31, 2020 attributable to our ongoing programs.

•Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs. We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners’ locations, interchange revenues will increase in excess of the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we typically do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. Overall, we expect our loyalty program costs to continue to be largely offset by our interchange revenues. These changes have been contemplated in our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.

•Capital and liquidity levels. We continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we declared and paid dividends of $520 million and repurchased $1.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, we temporarily suspended our share repurchase plans in 2020. We plan to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases subject to regulatory approval, as well as to support business growth. In January 2021, we announced that the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program of up to $1.6 billion through December 31, 2021, beginning in the first quarter of 2021, subject to the Company’s capital plan, market conditions and other factors, including regulatory restrictions and required approvals, if any. We continue to expect to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At December 31, 2020, the Company had a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.9%, which reflects our election to defer the impact of CECL on our regulatory capital, which will now be phased-in over a three-year period from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. 

We expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2020, due to the reduction in loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform, we continued to carry a high level of liquidity, which we expect to continue through the first half of 2021 in line with our expectations of customer payment behavior. We expect to deploy this excess liquidity during the second half of 2021 in line with our expectations of receivable growth, which will contribute to an increase in net interest margin in the second half of 2021 as we deploy this excess liquidity.

Seasonality

In our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down. 

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.

36

In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also typically experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

Interest Income

Interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.

We analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. Key drivers of average interest-earning assets include:

•purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners’ sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;

•payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;

•charge-offs, reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible;

•the size of our liquidity portfolio; and

•portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.

Key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:

•pricing (contractual rates of interest, movement in prime rates, late fees and merchant discount rates);

•changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);

•frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date;

•credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and

•yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.

Interest income decreased by $3.0 billion, or 15.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was driven primarily by a decrease in interest and fees on loans related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale, as well as the impact of COVID-19. The sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio drove a decline in interest and fees on loans compared to the prior year period of approximately 9%.

37

Average interest-earning assets 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in average loan receivables, including held for sale, of 9.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the sale of loan receivables associated with the Walmart and Yamaha portfolios, in October 2019 and January 2020, respectively. In addition, the decreases also reflect a decline in average active accounts of 4.2% at our ongoing partner programs, primarily due to the impact of COVID-19.

Yield on average interest-earning assets 

The yield on average interest-earning assets decreased for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in the yield on average loan receivables and a decrease in the percentage of interest-earning assets attributable to loan receivables. The yield on average loan receivables, including held for sale, decreased 120 basis points to 19.90% for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by lower benchmark rates and the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio, as well as fee and interest waivers related to COVID-19. 

Interest Expense

Interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and senior unsecured notes.

Key drivers of interest expense include:

•the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

•the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and

•the changing mix in our funding sources.

Interest expense decreased by $626 million, or 27.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by lower benchmark interest rates and a decrease in borrowings of our securitization entities and senior unsecured notes. Our cost of funds decreased to 2.07% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2.66% for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Average interest-bearing liabilities

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The decrease in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a decrease in borrowings of our securitization entities and senior unsecured notes.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense.

Net interest income decreased by $2.4 billion, or 14.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in interest and fees on loans related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and the impact of COVID-19, partially offset by a decrease in interest expense reflecting lower benchmark interest rates.

38

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. We also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for credit losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the growth and performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years.

We believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours. We also believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.

Retailer share arrangements decreased by $213 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting the impact of COVID-19 on program performance. 

Provision for Credit Losses

Provision for credit losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for credit losses at an appropriate level to absorb the expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date. Provision for credit losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for credit losses. Our process to determine our allowance for credit losses is based upon our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan balance as of the period end date. See “Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses” and Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for credit loss methodology. 

Provision for credit losses increased by $1.1 billion, or 27.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the effects of the prior year reductions in reserves for credit losses related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and higher reserve build in the current year, partially offset by lower net charge-offs. 

The higher reserve build reflects both the projected impacts of COVID-19 and the increase attributable to the CECL implementation of $285 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The prior year reductions in reserves related to the Walmart consumer portfolio were $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Our allowance coverage ratio increased to 12.54% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 6.42% at December 31, 2019.

39

Other Income

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Interchange revenue 

We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a percentage of the purchase amount. Interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products.

Interchange revenue decreased by $96 million, or 12.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by lower purchase volume and the effects from the Walmart consumer portfolio sale.

Debt cancellation fees 

Debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. 

Debt cancellation fees increased by $13 million, or 4.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of increases in our CareCredit and Payment Solutions sales platforms, partially offset by the effects from the Walmart consumer portfolio sale. 

Loyalty programs 

We operate a number of loyalty programs primarily in our Retail Card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. Growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.

Loyalty programs cost decreased by $94 million, or 12.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and lower purchase volume due to the effects of COVID-19, partially offset by growth related to our digital partners. 

Other 

Other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees, commission fees related to Pets Best, changes in the fair value of equity investments, realized gains or losses associated with the sale of investments or other assets and changes in contingent consideration obligations.

Other increased by $23 million, or 22.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to gains related to investment securities and commission fees related to Pets Best.

40

Other Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Employee costs 

Employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.

Employee costs decreased by $75 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by reductions in headcount, partially offset by a restructuring charge of $41 million incurred in 2020. 

Professional fees 

Professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.

Professional fees decreased by $108 million, or 12.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to interim servicing costs in the prior year associated with acquired portfolios.

Marketing and business development 

Marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.

Marketing and business development costs decreased by $101 million, or 18.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower brand advertising and lower portfolio marketing investments.

Information processing 

Information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.

Information processing costs increased slightly by $7 million, or 1.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software related to strategic investments, partially offset by lower data processing costs. 

Other 

Other primarily consists of postage, operational losses, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities' costs and telephone charges. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. Fraud, or operational losses, are driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.

The “other” component increased by $87 million, or 9.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to a restructuring charge of $46 million related to operating lease and other asset impairments, as well as higher operational losses.

Provision for Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2020, decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in pre-tax income, which led to a proportionally larger impact related to discrete tax benefits. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes. 

Platform Analysis

As discussed above under “Our Business—Our Sales Platforms,” we offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the year ended December 31, 2020, for each of our sales platforms.

Retail Card

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Retail Card interest and fees on loans decreased by $2,542 million, or 18.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio drove a decline compared to the prior year period of approximately 12%. The remaining decrease was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19.

Retailer share arrangements decreased by $203 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of the factors discussed under the heading “Retailer Share Arrangements” above.

Other income decreased by $28 million, or 10.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by a decrease in interchange revenue and the effects from the Walmart consumer portfolio sale, partially offset by lower loyalty costs. 

Payment Solutions

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Payment Solutions interest and fees on loans decreased by $168 million, or 5.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower yield on loan receivables and the sale of the Yamaha portfolio.

42

CareCredit

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

CareCredit interest and fees on loans decreased by $45 million, or 1.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchant discount as a result of the decline in purchase volume and a reduction in average loan receivables.

Other income increased by $33 million, or 41.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to commission fees earned by Pets Best.

Loan Receivables

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Loan Receivables, including troubled debt restructurings.

Our loan receivables portfolio, excluding held for sale, had the following maturity distribution at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Credit card loans have minimum payment requirements but no stated maturity and therefore are included in the due within one year category. However, many of our credit card holders will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances at December 31, 2020.

(2)Credit card and commercial loans due after one year relate to Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") assets.

(3)Reflects scheduled repayments up to the final contractual maturity of our installment loans.

43

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

COVID-19 Related Loan Modifications

TDRs are those loans for which we have granted a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties where we do not receive adequate compensation. These loans are identified at the point when the borrower enters into a modification program. See Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on loans classified as TDRs. However, short-term loan modifications to support our customers impacted by COVID-19 are not accounted for as a TDR.

Under the CARES Act, banks may elect to deem that loan modifications do not result in TDRs if they are (1) related to COVID-19; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (B) January 1, 2022. At December 31, 2020, we have not made such an election. 

However, certain other short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to COVID-19 are also not considered TDRs under ASC Subtopic 310-40. This includes delays in payment that are insignificant or short-term (e.g., up to six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers or extensions of repayment terms to borrowers who were current prior to any relief. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented.

During 2020 we provided support to our customers impacted by COVID-19 through various actions, such as minimum payment deferrals and interest and late fee waivers. Loans enrolled in minimum payment deferrals generally continued to accrue interest and their delinquency status as of the modification date did not advance through the deferment period.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we enrolled approximately 2.1 million customers in short-term modifications to defer minimum payments, representing $3.9 billion in loan receivables. The substantial majority of these enrollments were for our credit card customers. For certain customers we also provided waivers of interest charges or late fees. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the waivers of interest and late fees provided to our customers resulted in foregone interest and fee income of $88 million. 

At December 31, 2020, all of the enrolled accounts have exited our forbearance programs. While we have experienced a higher incidence rate of accounts becoming delinquent following their exit from these short-term programs, as compared to accounts that did not enter the forbearance program, these accounts did not have a material impact to the Company's overall delinquency metrics at December 31, 2020.

Delinquencies

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables decreased to 3.07% at December 31, 2020, as compared to 4.44% at December 31, 2019. The 137 basis point decrease in 2020 was primarily driven by an improvement in customer payment behavior. 

44

Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The table below sets forth the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, (“net charge-off rate”) for the periods indicated.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Allowance for Credit Losses and Impact of Adoption of CECL

The allowance for credit losses totaled $10.3 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with allowance for loan losses of $5.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Similarly, our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loan receivables increased to 12.54% at December 31, 2020, from 6.42% at December 31, 2019. 

The increases in the allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio reflect the impact of the CECL adoption and implementation in January 2020. Upon adoption of the accounting standard on January 1, 2020, we recorded an increase to our allowance for loan losses of $3.0 billion. The allowance for credit losses at December 31, 2020 reflects our estimate of expected credit losses for the life of the loan receivables on our consolidated statement of financial position at December 31, 2020, which includes the consideration of current and expected macroeconomic conditions that existed at that date. 

During the initial year of implementation of the CECL accounting standard we continued to determine what our allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio would have been if the prior accounting guidance were still in effect, in order to help provide comparability with our prior year results. The following table illustrates the effects of the implementation of the accounting standard to our allowance for credit losses and allowance coverage ratio at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Amounts shown above as if the prior accounting guidance remained in effect are non-GAAP measures and are presented only in this initial year after adoption for comparability with the prior year reported GAAP metrics.

In addition to the effects of the increases attributable to CECL noted in the above table, our allowance coverage ratio increased as compared to December 31, 2019 primarily due to the projected impacts from COVID-19.

45

Credit Quality Indicators

As part of our credit risk management activities, on an ongoing basis, we assess overall credit quality by reviewing information related to the performance of a customer’s account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. We now utilize VantageScore (“Vantage”) credit scores to assist in our assessment of credit quality as we believe Vantage scores more U.S. consumers, and potential applicants, as compared to our prior use of FICO credit scores. Vantage credit scores are obtained at origination of the account and are refreshed, at a minimum quarterly, but could be as often as weekly, to assist in predicting customer behavior. We categorize these credit scores into the following three credit score categories: (i) 651 or higher, which are considered the strongest credits; (ii) 591 to 650, considered moderate credit risk; and (iii) 590 or less, which are considered weaker credits. We believe these three categories of Vantage credit scores represent an approximation of the categories previously reported using FICO data in terms of both probability of default and customer account distribution.

The following charts show the proportion of our loan portfolios that were from customers with a Vantage score of 651 or higher, as compared to those customers with a FICO score of 661 or higher. The quarterly information presented illustrates the comparability of credit trends under each scoring method and category of strongest credit.

See Note 4. Loan Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our credit quality indicators related to our loan receivables.

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.

Funding Sources

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior unsecured notes. 

The following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Excludes $306 million, $280 million and $282 million average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Deposits

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers (“direct deposits”) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers (“brokered deposits”). At December 31, 2020, we had $52.1 billion in direct deposits and $10.7 billion in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to utilize our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.

Our direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. 

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with 11 brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at December 31, 2020, had a weighted average remaining life of 1.7 years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.

47

The following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing time deposits was 1.0 years. See Note 7. Deposits to our consolidated financial statements for more information on their maturities.

The following table summarizes deposits by contractual maturity at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Includes brokered certificates of deposit for which underlying individual deposit balances are assumed to be less than $250,000.

(2)The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. Deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit presented above include partially uninsured accounts.

Securitized Financings

We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (“SYNIT”) through which we may issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”). 

At December 31, 2020, we had $2.3 billion of outstanding private asset-backed securities and $5.5 billion of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each case held by unrelated third parties.

48

The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNCT notes and SYNIT notes that we owned at December 31, 2020.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT. 

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Represents the excess spread (generally calculated as interest income collected from the applicable pool of loan receivables less applicable net charge-offs, interest expense and servicing costs, divided by the aggregate principal amount of loan receivables in the applicable pool) for SFT or, in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, a range of the excess spreads relating to the particular series issued within each trust, in all cases omitting any series that have not been outstanding for at least three full monthly periods and calculated in accordance with the applicable trust or series documentation, for the three securitization monthly periods ended December 31, 2020.

49

Senior Unsecured Notes

During the year ended December 31, 2020 we made repayments of $1.5 billion, which included all of our previously outstanding floating rate senior unsecured notes.

The following table provides a summary of our outstanding senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

______________________

(1)Weighted average interest rate of all senior unsecured notes at December 31, 2020 was 3.94% 

(2)The amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs. 

Short-Term Borrowings

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.

Other 

At December 31, 2020, we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

Covenants

The indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) Synchrony’s ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.

If we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at December 31, 2020.

At December 31, 2020, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

50

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks: 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Liquidity

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at December 31, 2020 had $18.3 billion of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to $17.3 billion of liquid assets at December 31, 2019. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to the reduction in our loan receivables and the retention of excess cash flows from operations. Additionally, on March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve Board reduced reserve requirements for insured depository institutions to zero percent, which further increased the Bank's available liquidity. We believe our liquidity position at December 31, 2020 remains strong as we continue to operate in a period of uncertain economic conditions related to COVID-19 and we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity as economic conditions change.

As additional sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate of $4.9 billion of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and $0.5 billion of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than $25.0 billion of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.

51

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends, see “Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.” and “Regulation—Savings Association Regulation—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.”
