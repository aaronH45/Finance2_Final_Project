BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Intuit’s Mission

At Intuit, our mission is to power prosperity around the world. All of our customers have a common set of needs. They are trying to make ends meet, maximize their tax refund, save money and pay off debt. 

Those who have made the bold decision to become entrepreneurs, and go into business for themselves, have an additional set of needs. They want to find and keep customers, get paid for their hard work, access capital to grow and ensure their books are right.

Across our platform, we use the power of technology to deliver three core benefits to our customers: helping put more money in their pockets, eliminating work and saving people time so they can focus on what matters to them, and ensuring that they have complete confidence in every financial decision they make.

The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is fundamentally reshaping our world — and Intuit is taking advantage of this technological revolution to find new ways to deliver on our mission. We are focused on capitalizing on this opportunity to improve prosperity globally and inspire our workforce, while investing in our company’s reputation and durable growth in the future.

Our Business Portfolio

We organize our businesses into four reportable segments:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Our Growth Strategy

At Intuit, our strategy starts with customer obsession. We listen to and observe our customers, understand their challenges, and then use advanced technology, including AI, to develop innovative solutions designed to solve their most important financial problems. For more than three decades, we have reinvented and disrupted ourselves in order to ensure our customers are armed with the technology they need to grow and prosper.

Our strategy for delivering on our bold goals is to become an AI-driven expert platform where we and others can solve our customers’ most important problems. We plan to accelerate the development of the platform by applying AI in three key areas:

•An Open Platform: None of us can do it alone, including Intuit. The best way to deliver for customers is by creating an open, collaborative platform. It’s the power of partnerships that accelerates the world’s success. Our open technology platform integrates with partners so together we can deliver value and benefits that matter the most to our customers.

•Application of AI: AI helps our customers work smarter because we can automate, predict and personalize their experience. Using AI technologies, we are: leveraging machine learning to build decision engines and algorithms that learn from rich datasets to transform user experiences; applying knowledge engineering and turning compliance rules into code; and using natural language processing to revolutionize how customers interact with products and services. 

•Incorporating Experts: One of the biggest problems our customers face is confidence. Even with current advances in technology that deliver personalized tools and insights, many people want to connect with a real person to help give them the confidence they are making the right decision. By bringing experts onto our platform we can solve this massive problem for customers. The power of our virtual expert platform allows us to scale the intelligence of our products, elevating experts to advisors and delivering big benefits for customers. 

As we build our AI-driven expert platform, we are prioritizing our resources on five strategic priorities across the company. These priorities focus on solving the problems that matter most to customers and include:

•Revolutionizing speed to benefit: When customers use our products and services, we aim to deliver value instantly by making the interactions with our offerings frictionless, without the need for customers to manually enter data. We are accelerating the application of AI with a goal to revolutionize the customer experience. This priority is foundational across our business, and execution against it positions us to succeed with our other four strategic priorities.

•Connecting people to experts: The largest problem our customers face is lack of confidence to file their own taxes or to manage their books. To build their confidence, we are connecting our customers to experts. We offer customers access to experts to help them make important decisions – and experts, such as accountants, gain access to new customers so they can grow their businesses.

•Unlocking smart money decisions: Crippling high-cost debt and lack of savings are at unprecedented levels across the U.S. To address these challenges, we are creating a personal financial assistant that helps consumers find the right financial products, put more money in their pockets and access financial expertise and advice. Our acquisition of Credit Karma accelerates our ability to achieve this vision, by combining two trusted brands, customer reach, data and platform capabilities to deliver breakthrough benefits that will power prosperity for customers around the world.

•Be the center of small business growth: We are focused on helping customers grow their businesses by offering a broad, seamless set of tools that are designed to help them get paid faster, manage and get access to capital, pay

employees with confidence, and use third-party apps to help run their businesses. At the same time, we want to position ourselves to better serve product-based businesses to benefit customers who sell products through multiple channels.

•Disrupt the small business mid-market: We aim to disrupt the mid-market with QuickBooks Online Advanced, our online offering designed to address the needs of small business customers with 10 to 100 employees. This offering enables us to increase retention of these larger customers, and attract new mid-market customers who are over-served by available offerings.

As the external environment evolves, we continue to innovate and adapt our strategy and anticipate our customers’ needs. For more than 35 years, we have been dedicated to developing innovative financial and compliance products and services that are easy to use and are available where and when customers need them. As a result, our customers actively recommend our products and solutions to others, which is one important way that we measure the success of our strategy.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

During fiscal 2021 we offered our products and services in the four segments described in “Business Overview” above. The following table shows the revenue for each of these segments over the last three fiscal years. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

For financial information about our reportable segments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and Note 14 to the financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.

Small Business & Self-Employed

Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment serves small businesses and the self-employed around the world, and the accounting professionals who assist and advise them. Our goal is for QuickBooks to be the source of truth for each small business customer who uses our integrated platform. We work to make this a reality through our three-pillared growth strategy: Grow the Core by transforming financial management software and meeting customers where they are; Connect the Ecosystem, by meeting a wider range of customer needs with a single integrated platform; and expand our geographic footprint globally, by serving small businesses around the world. With this strategy we enable a powerful ecosystem, personalized using artificial intelligence, to deliver a suite of right-for-me solutions to a wide range of customers globally. 

Our integrated platform includes:

QuickBooks Online. Our QuickBooks financial management solutions help small businesses, the self-employed, and accountants solve financial and compliance problems, make more money and reduce unnecessary work, while giving them complete confidence in their actions and decisions. Users can track income and expenses, create and send invoices and estimates, manage and pay bills, and review a variety of financial reports. QuickBooks Live enables our customers to obtain live bookkeeping advice from professionals. QuickBooks Online also comes with a powerful mobile app available on iOS and Android which enables customers to run their entire business from their phone. The app provides the customers instant access to their QuickBooks data and includes powerful features that take advantage of mobile technology such as automatically tracking business miles or the ability to upload a picture of a receipt.

QuickBooks Online is an open platform, enabling third-party developers to create online and mobile applications that integrate with our offering. A growing number of companies offer applications built for our QuickBooks platform, including PayPal, Shopify and Square.

QuickBooks Desktop Software. Our QuickBooks financial management solutions are also available as desktop versions for small businesses. 

In addition to our core QuickBooks offering, we also offer specific solutions for the following customer segments:

•Mid-Market Small Businesses. Our QuickBooks Online Advanced and QuickBooks Enterprise offerings are designed for small businesses with 10 to 100 employees that have more complex needs. QuickBooks Online Advanced, Intuit’s cloud-based offering, is specifically designed for high-growth, mid-market small businesses and leverages AI, automation and data insights to deliver more ways for them to grow and scale. QuickBooks Enterprise is available for

download and can also be provided as a hosted solution. This offering provides industry-specific reports and features for a range of industries, including Contractor, Manufacturing and Wholesale, Nonprofit, and Retail.

•Self-Employed. QuickBooks Self-Employed is designed specifically for self-employed customers whose needs are different than small businesses that use QuickBooks. Features include categorizing business and personal transactions, identifying and classifying tax deductible expenses, tracking mileage, calculating estimated quarterly taxes and sending invoices. QuickBooks Self-Employed can be combined with TurboTax to export and pay year-end taxes. QuickBooks Self-Employed is available both online and via a mobile application. 

•Product-Based Businesses. With QuickBooks Commerce, product-based businesses such as online sellers are able to access inventory and sales from multiple sales channels, manage orders and fulfillment, sync inventory across online and offline channels to avoid stockouts and gain profitability insights. QuickBooks Commerce also helps small businesses attract and sell to new customers across multiple channels and ultimately grow their business. 

•Accountants. QuickBooks Online Accountant and QuickBooks Accountant Desktop Plus are available to accounting professionals who use QuickBooks offerings and recommend them to their small business clients. These offerings provide the tools and file-sharing capabilities that accounting professionals need to efficiently complete bookkeeping and financial reporting tasks as well as manage their practices. We also offer memberships to the QuickBooks ProAdvisor program, which provides accountants access to QuickBooks Online Accountant, QuickBooks Accountant Desktop Plus, QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise Accountant, QuickBooks Point of Sale Desktop, technical support, training, product certification, marketing tools, and discounts on Intuit products and services purchased on behalf of clients.

Ecosystem Services

Employer Solutions (Payroll and Time Tracking). Our payroll solutions are sold on a subscription basis and integrate with our QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Desktop offerings. All of our payroll offerings allow customers to perform payroll processing, direct deposit of employee paychecks, payroll reports, electronic payment of federal and state payroll taxes, and electronic filing of federal and state payroll tax forms. Our QuickBooks Online payroll offerings include automated tax payments and filings, as well as access to employee benefits offerings like health insurance and 401ks. Certain online offerings also include same day direct deposit, access to human resource advice, and access to additional expert-powered services like Tax Penalty Protection. QuickBooks Desktop payroll is available in both a self-service and an assisted version, depending on whether customers want to do their own taxes or leverage automated tax payments and filings. We also offer QuickBooks Time which seamlessly integrates with QuickBooks Payroll and third-party payroll products to help businesses easily and accurately track time across a mobile workforce, including tools for project planning, job costing, and tracking per-client billable hours.

Payment Processing Solutions. Our full range of merchant services for small businesses includes credit card, debit card, Apple Pay, and ACH payment services for in person and card not present payments. We offer instant deposit options for eligible customers. QuickBooks Payments is deeply integrated into QuickBooks through seamless onboarding and automated transaction reconciliation, and is the default payment solution for QuickBooks invoicing. Our Payments offering is also connected with QuickBooks Cash, our small business banking solution, through integrated onboarding and instant funds availability. In addition to transaction processing services, our services include broad customer support, merchant and consumer collections, chargeback and retrieval support, and fraud and loss prevention screening. 

Capital for Small Businesses. We offer financing options for small businesses to help them get the capital they need to succeed. The financing process provides small businesses the ability to use their QuickBooks data to qualify to borrow capital.

QuickBooks Cash. The QuickBooks Cash business bank account with debit card adds banking capabilities to QuickBooks’ robust business offerings. QuickBooks Cash, when used with the QuickBooks suite of business services, takes the complexity and latency out of managing finances for small business owners. QuickBooks Cash has no account opening fees, maintenance fees, minimum balances, overdraft fees, or other recurring fees. QuickBooks Cash includes a machine-learning powered finance planner which helps small businesses plan for the future by making 90-day cash flow projections, including predictions on when invoices are likely to be paid, enabling small business customers to better manage their cash flow.

Financial Supplies. We offer a range of financial supplies designed for individuals and small businesses that use our QuickBooks offerings. These include standard paper checks and Secure Plus checks with CheckLock fraud protection features, a variety of stationery, tax forms and related supplies.

Consumer

Our Consumer segment includes our TurboTax products and services that are designed to enable customers to prepare and file their federal and state income tax returns quickly and accurately. These offerings are available either online or as desktop versions. They are designed to be easy to use, yet sophisticated enough for complex tax returns. For customers using our online offerings and looking for additional advice or guidance along the way, we have experts standing by to offer tax review and advice all year round. We also have experts available to prepare, sign and file tax returns for customers who prefer to have

Tables of Contents

their taxes prepared for them. Within this segment, we also offer Mint, which is an online personal finance offering aimed at helping customers track their finances and daily financial behaviors. Our online offerings can be accessed on mobile devices.

Tax Return Preparation Offerings. For the 2020 tax season, we offered a variety of commercial software products and tax filing services to meet the different needs of our customers, including those filing simple returns, those who itemize deductions, own investments or rental property, and small business owners. Customers can electronically file their federal and state income tax returns through our electronic filing service. We also offered TurboTax Live for customers seeking to obtain tax advice from professionals, TurboTax Live Full Service for customers seeking to have their tax returns prepared for them, as well as audit defense and audit support services. Our online tax preparation and filing services were offered through the websites of thousands of financial institutions, electronic retailers, and other online merchants. Financial institutions can offer our online tax preparation and filing services to their customers through a link to TurboTax Online. Our TurboTax U.S. and Canada offerings consist of desktop, online, and mobile offerings. In addition to our commercial product offerings, for the 2020 tax season we were a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government to donate free online federal tax preparation and filing services to the IRS, which the IRS then markets to eligible consumers on an IRS website. At the conclusion of this tax season in October, we will no longer participate in the Free File Alliance. See also “Competition – Consumer Segment” later in this Item 1 for more information on the Free File Alliance.

Credit Karma

Our Credit Karma segment provides consumers with a financial platform that helps them find the right financial products and put more money in their pockets. The platform offers a number of free services to its members: access to their credit scores and reports, credit and identity monitoring, credit report dispute, data-driven resources, personalized recommendations of credit card, loan, and insurance products and online savings and checking accounts through our bank partner, MVB Bank, Inc., Member FDIC. To provide these services to its members, Credit Karma works with a variety of partners, including credit bureaus, banks, credit card issuers, and other financial institutions and lending partners. Additionally, Credit Karma leverages Lightbox, a first-of-its-kind enterprise platform which allows lenders to leverage thousands of de-identified data points from Credit Karma members to help provide its members with greater certainty that they will be approved if they apply for a financial product. 

ProConnect

Our ProConnect segment includes our professional tax offerings and serves professional accountants in the U.S. and Canada, who are essential to both small business success and tax preparation and filing. Our professional tax offerings consist of Lacerte, ProSeries, and ProConnect Tax Online in the U.S., and ProFile and ProTax Online in Canada. These offerings enable accountants to accurately and efficiently complete and electronically file a full range of consumer, small business, and commercial federal and state tax returns. Lacerte is designed for full-service year-round accounting firms who handle more complex returns. ProSeries is designed for year-round tax practices handling moderately complex tax returns. ProConnect Tax Online is our cloud-based solution, which is designed for full-service year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and small business returns and integrates with our QuickBooks Online offerings. ProFile is our Canadian desktop tax offering, which serves year-round full-service accounting firms for both consumer and business tax returns. ProTax Online is our Canadian cloud based tax solution, which is designed for full-service year-round practices who prepare all forms of consumer and business tax returns, and is fully integrated into QuickBooks Online Accountant to provide seamless integration of data across books and tax through our Workpapers solution. We also offer a variety of tax-related services that complement the tax return preparation process including year-round document storage, collaboration services, e-signature, and bank products, and additional capabilities such as fixed asset management, desktop hosting, and third party solutions for practice management for some of our U.S. tax offerings.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

The markets for software and related services are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. Continuous investment is required to innovate and develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings to be successful in these markets. Our product development efforts are more important than ever as we pursue our growth strategy.

We develop many of our products and services internally, and we have a number of United States and foreign patents and pending applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We also supplement our internal development efforts by acquiring or licensing products and technology from third parties, and establishing other relationships that enable us to enhance or expand our offerings more rapidly. We expect to expand our third-party technology relationships as we continue to pursue our growth strategy.

Our online offerings and mobile applications have rapid development cycles, while our traditional desktop software products tend to have predictable annual development and product release cycles. In addition, developing consumer and professional tax software and services presents unique challenges because of the demanding development cycle required to accurately incorporate federal and state tax law and tax form changes within a rigid timetable. The development timing for our small 

 Intuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K9 

Tables of Contents

business payroll and merchant payment processing services offerings varies with business needs and regulatory requirements, and the length of the development cycle depends on the scope and complexity of each project.

We continue to make substantial investments in research and development, and we expect to focus our future research and development efforts on enhancing existing products and services with financial recommendations, personalization, and ease of use enabled by AI and other advanced technologies. We continue to focus on developing new products and services, including new mobile and global offerings, and significant research and development efforts for ongoing projects to update the technology platforms for several of our offerings. 

SEASONALITY

Our Consumer and ProConnect offerings have a significant and distinct seasonal pattern as sales and revenue from our income tax preparation products and services are typically concentrated in the period from November through April. This seasonal pattern typically results in higher net revenues during our second and third quarters ending January 31 and April 30, respectively. 

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of tax filing seasons for fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 varied significantly. In fiscal 2019, the IRS began accepting returns on January 28, 2019 and the tax filing deadline was April 15, 2019. In fiscal 2020, the IRS began accepting returns on January 27, 2020 and the tax filing deadline was July 15, 2020. In fiscal 2021, the IRS began accepting returns on February 12, 2021 and the tax filing deadline was May 17, 2021. These changes to the tax filing seasons impacted our quarterly financial results during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.

We expect the seasonality of our Consumer and ProConnect businesses to continue to have a significant impact on our quarterly financial results in the future.

MARKETING, SALES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

Markets 

Our primary customers are consumers, small businesses, and the self-employed. We also provide specialized tax and accounting products to professional accountants, who are key partners to help us reach small business customers. The markets in which we compete have always been characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs, and frequent new product introductions and enhancements by competitors. Over the past several years, the widespread usage of mobile devices and the explosion of social media have accelerated the pace of change and revolutionized the way that customers learn about, evaluate, and purchase products and services.

Real-time, personalized online and mobile shopping experiences are the standard. In addition, many customers now begin shopping in one channel and ultimately purchase in another. This has created a need for integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy experiences. Market and industry changes quickly make existing products and services obsolete. Our success depends on our ability to respond rapidly to these changes with new business models, updated competitive strategies, new or enhanced products and services, alternative distribution methods, and other changes in the way we do business.

Marketing Programs

We use a variety of marketing programs to generate direct sales, develop leads, increase general awareness of our product portfolio, and drive sales in retail. These programs include digital marketing such as display and pay-per-click advertising, search engine optimization, and social and affiliate marketing; mobile marketing through online app stores; email marketing; offline marketing such as TV, radio, billboard, magazine and newspaper advertising; retail marketing; public relations; and in product marketing to drive awareness of related products and services. Our campaigns are designed to attract new users, retain existing users, and cross sell additional offerings.

Sales and Distribution Channels

Multi-Channel Shop-and-Buy Experiences. Our customers use the web and mobile devices to research products and services. Some customers buy and use our products and services entirely online or through their mobile devices. Others research online but make their purchase at a retail location. Because many customers shop across multiple channels, we continue to coordinate our online, offline, and retail presence and promotions to support an integrated, multi-channel, shop-and-buy model. We also focus on cross-selling complementary Intuit and third-party offerings online and in-product.

Direct Sales Channel. We sell many of our products and services directly through our websites and call centers. Direct, online sales are an effective channel for customers who can make purchase decisions based on content provided on our websites, via other online content or word of mouth recommendations. Telesales continues to be an effective channel for serving customers that want live help to select the products and services that are right for their needs. We also have a direct sales force that calls on U.S. and international accounting firms and seeks to increase their awareness, usage, and recommendation of our small business and professional tax solutions. For mid-market businesses, we have implemented and expanded on our omni channel go to market strategy by diversifying and growing our technology partner channel and industry focused direct sales teams.

Tables of Contents

Mobile Application Stores. We distribute many of our offerings for mobile devices through proprietary online stores that provide applications for specific devices. These include the Apple App Store and Google’s Play Store. 

Partner and Other Channels. We sell our products and services through partners including value-added resellers, system integrators (including accountants), and managed service providers who help us reach new customers at the point of need and drive growth and market share by extending our online reach. These partners combine our products and services with marketing, sales, and technical expertise to deliver a complete solution at the local level. We also sell our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software as well as payroll services at retail locations across the United States and Canada and on retailer websites. In Canada, we also rely on distributors who sell products into the retail channel. 

COMPETITION

Overview

We face intense competition in all of our businesses, both domestically and internationally. Competitive interest and expertise in many of the markets we serve have grown markedly over the past few years and we expect this trend to continue. Some of our existing competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In addition, the competitive landscape can shift rapidly as new companies enter and existing companies expand their businesses to include the markets in which we compete. This is particularly true for online and mobile products and services, where the barriers to entry are lower than they are for desktop software products and services. To attract customers, many online and mobile competitors are offering free or low-priced products which we must take into account in our pricing strategies.

Given the breadth of the products and services that we offer as a global technology company, we compete with the offerings from a variety of companies across a range of industries. Our most obvious competition comes from other companies that currently offer technology solutions similar to ours. In our Small Business & Self-Employed segment, we face competition from a variety of companies that provide products or services to address the problems that we help our customers to solve, including getting paid faster, paying their employees, accessing capital and ensuring their books are done right. Our Consumer segment competes with companies that offer products and services to help customers file their taxes, better manage their money and reduce their debt. We may also face competition from companies with platforms that could be developed to offer competing technology solutions to any of the problems that our customers may face, such as Facebook, Amazon and Google. In addition, for many of our products and services, other competitive alternatives for customers are third-party service providers such as professional accountants and seasonal tax preparation businesses. Manual tools and processes, or general-purpose software, are also important competitive alternatives. In some cases, a competitor in one of our segments may be our partner in another one of our segments. In other cases, a company may compete with us in more than one of our segments.

Competition Specific to Segments

Small Business & Self-Employed Segment. QuickBooks is a leading small business financial management software in the U.S. Small businesses often look to several companies to address their problems. Therefore, our small business products and services face competitive challenges from a variety of companies that provide products or services that address one or more of their problems. We compete to help small businesses get their books right with Xero, The Sage Group plc, and FreshBooks, among others, which offer software and associated services as well as online accounting offerings that directly serve small business customers. For small businesses with more complex financial management needs, our competitors include The Sage Group plc’s Intacct offering and Microsoft Dynamics. We also compete with free or low-cost online accounting offerings, and free online banking and bill payment services offered by financial institutions and others. In our payroll business we compete directly with Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP), Paychex, Gusto, and many other companies that help small businesses to pay their employees. In our merchant services business we help our customers get paid faster and compete directly with large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan Chase, and Bank of America and with many payment processors, including First Data Corporation, Elavon, Global Payments, Fidelity National Information Services, PayPal, and Square. Our QuickBooks Capital offering, which helps small businesses to access capital, competes with a range of lending enterprises, including large financial institutions, such as the ones listed above, fintech companies, such as Square and PayPal, and others.

Consumer Segment. In our Consumer segment, we compete to help our customers to file their taxes. Our future growth depends on our ability to attract new customers to the self-preparation tax category and to our assisted offering, TurboTax Live, from tax stores and other tax preparers. In the U.S. private sector we face intense competition from H&R Block, which provides tax preparation services in its stores and a competing software offering. We also face competition from several other large tax preparation service providers, from a myriad of small tax preparers, and from numerous online self-preparation offerings, including Blucora’s TaxAct, Free Tax USA, TaxSlayer, and Square. Some of these competitors are offering electronic tax preparation and filing services at no cost to individual taxpayers. In Canada, our TurboTax Canada offerings face competition from H&R Block, SimpleTax, StudioTax, and UFile, among others. These competing offerings subject us to significant price pressure in both the U.S. and Canada. We also face competitive challenges from government entities that offer publicly funded electronic tax preparation and filing services with no fees to individual taxpayers. Our Mint offering competes with numerous personal financial management companies and large financial institutions to help our customers track their finances and better manage their money.

 Intuit Fiscal 2021 Form 10-K11 

Tables of Contents

For the 2020 tax season, we were a member of the Free File Alliance, a consortium of private sector companies that has entered into an agreement with the federal government. Under this agreement, the member companies donate online federal tax preparation and filing services to eligible users at no cost to the government or individual users separate and apart from the member companies’ commercial free offerings, which the IRS then offers to eligible consumers on an IRS website. Approximately 22 states and the District of Columbia have also entered public-private partnerships with the Free File Alliance. Additionally, certain member companies, including Intuit, provided online state tax preparation and filing services at no cost if the taxpayer qualified for the free federal return under this program. We will no longer participate in the Free File Alliance after the conclusion of the 2020 tax season in October. We continue to actively work with others in the private and public sectors to support successful public-private partnerships that reinforce the voluntary compliance tax system, encourage electronic filing, and inform consumers of free filing options. However, future administrative, regulatory, or legislative activity in this area could seek to replace the voluntary compliance tax system with return preparation, or self preparation options, provided by government agencies which could harm our Consumer business.

Credit Karma Segment. Credit Karma faces significant competition for member growth and partnerships. Credit Karma competes against many companies to attract and engage members, including the credit bureaus as well as companies that provide personal finance management products and tools which offer a variety of credit-score monitoring and personal finance services and content. Credit Karma faces competition with some elements of businesses of LendingTree, Red Ventures, NerdWallet, Square, Chime, among others. However, the personal finance industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. An increasing number of companies are competing directly with Credit Karma.

ProConnect Segment. In the U.S., Lacerte professional tax offerings face competition from competitively-priced tax and accounting solutions that include integration with non-tax functionality. These include CCH’s ProSystem fx Office Suite and Thomson Reuters’ CS Professional Suite and GoSystem Tax. Our ProSeries professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s ATX and TaxWise offerings, Drake, and other smaller providers. In Canada, our ProFile professional tax offerings face competition from CCH’s Cantax and Taxprep offerings, TaxCycle, and Thomson Reuters’ DTMax and UFile Pro offerings. We also face growing competition from online tax and accounting offerings in the U.S. and Canada, which may be marketed more effectively or have lower pricing than our offerings for accounting professionals.

Competitive Factors

We believe the most important competitive factors for our core offerings – QuickBooks, TurboTax, Lacerte, ProSeries, and Credit Karma – are ease of use, product features, size of the installed customer base, size of membership base, member engagement, brand name recognition, value proposition, cost, reliability, security, and product and support quality. Access to distribution channels is also important for our QuickBooks and TurboTax desktop software products. In addition, support from accounting professionals and the ability for customers to upgrade within product families as their businesses grow are significant competitive factors for our QuickBooks products. Productivity is an important competitive factor for the full-service accounting firms to which we market our Lacerte software products. We believe we compete effectively on these factors as our QuickBooks and TurboTax products are the leading products in the U.S. for their respective categories.

For our service offerings such as small business payroll and merchant payment processing, we believe the most important competitive factors are functionality, ease of use, high availability, security, the integration of these products with related software, brand name recognition, effective distribution, quality of support, and cost.

CUSTOMER SUCCESS

For our QuickBooks, TurboTax, ProConnect and Mint offerings, we provide product support and technical support through channels including telephone, e-mail, online and video chat, text messaging, our customer support websites, self-help assets embedded in our products, and online communities where consumers can share knowledge and product advice with each other.

We also provide access to experts, through our TurboTax and QuickBooks Live offerings, who provide tax advice, tax preparation and bookkeeping services.

Our customer success staff predominantly consists of Intuit-employed and outsourced experts. We supplement with seasonal employees and additional outsourcing during periods of peak call volumes, such as during the tax return filing season or following a major product launch. We outsource to several firms domestically and internationally. Most of our internationally outsourced small business customer success personnel are currently located in the Philippines.

We also source staff through our Prosperity Hub program, which is designed to spark economic prosperity for people and communities in need. One part of this program is our socially responsible sourcing model, where we both directly and through customer success partner-employers, hire, train, and retain workers who deliver support and services for our customers.

Self-help information is offered for free in-product and on our support websites for our QuickBooks, TurboTax, Mint and professional tax offerings. Support alternatives and fees vary by product. For example, some product subscriptions receive 24x7 support and additional contact channel options.

PARTNER SUCCESS

For our Credit Karma offerings we have a Partner Success team that is dedicated to ensuring that our financial institution partners operate efficiently and safely on our platform. This team consists of program management, operations, and compliance professionals, who interface directly with lending partners to facilitate new product launches; maintain product offers, including any updates to existing offers and compliance monitoring; manage and maintain data required for offers and partner invoicing; support audits and compliance reviews; and manage and resolve incidents to mitigate any potential negative impact on either Credit Karma’s or the partner’s platform.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION

Online Products and Services

Our online offerings include QuickBooks Online, online payroll services, merchant payment processing services, TurboTax Online, ProConnect Tax Online, consumer and professional electronic tax filing services, Mint, and Turbo. We recently completed the transition of our systems, networks and databases used to operate these online offerings to public cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS). Currently, all of our online offerings are operating using AWS.

Desktop Software and Supplies

Although an increasing proportion of our desktop software customers choose to electronically download software, many customers continue to choose to purchase these products in the form of physical media. The key processes in manufacturing desktop software are manufacturing compact discs (CDs) and digital video discs (DVDs), printing boxes and related materials, and assembling and shipping the final products.

For retail manufacturing and distribution, we have agreements with Arvato Digital Services, Inc. (Arvato), a division of Bertelsmann AG, under which Arvato provides a majority of the manufacturing volume for our launches of QuickBooks and TurboTax and day-to-day replenishment after product launches, as well as our retail distribution logistics. Arvato also provides most of the manufacturing volume and distribution services for our direct desktop software orders.

Customers typically receive desktop software electronically. However, when physical product is ordered, we typically ship the physical product within a few days of receiving an order and backlog is minimal.

PRIVACY AND SECURITY OF CUSTOMER AND WORKFORCE INFORMATION AND TRANSACTIONS

We are stewards of our customers’ data and have designed data stewardship principles to align our organization in collecting, using and protecting such information. As we believe strongly in being good stewards of our customers’ data, we operate our program to comply with laws and regulations that govern our use, sharing and protection of customers’ personal information, including, for example, laws with respect to financial services and the handling of tax data. We have established guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and members of our workforce are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to inform public policy for privacy and security. 

We use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information that customers and members of our workforce give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. We use technical, logical and procedural measures, such as multi-factor authentication, which are designed to help detect and prevent fraud and misuse of customer information. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information to us, such as credit card information or tax return data, through one of our websites or products, we follow current industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us, and when we store it at rest. We routinely patch our systems with security updates and we work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Our Consumer and ProConnect segments are subject to federal, state and international government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. Our Small Business & Self-Employed segment offers products and services to small businesses and consumers, such as payroll, payments, and financing, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements. Our Credit Karma segment offers personal finance products and services to consumers, such as recommendations of credit card, loan and insurance products and access to credit scores and reports, which are also subject to certain regulatory requirements.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Our success depends on the proprietary technology embodied in our offerings. We protect this proprietary technology by relying on a variety of intellectual property mechanisms, including copyright, patent, trade secret and trademark laws, restrictions on disclosure and other methods. For example, we regularly file applications for patents, copyrights and trademarks and service marks in order to protect intellectual property that we believe is important to our business. We hold a growing patent portfolio that we believe is important to Intuit’s overall competitive advantage, although we are not materially dependent on any one patent or particular group of patents in our portfolio at this time. We also have a number of registered trademarks that include Intuit, QuickBooks, Lacerte, TurboTax, QB, ProSeries, ProConnect, Mint, and Credit Karma. We have registered these and other trademarks and service marks in the United States and, depending on the relevance of each brand to other markets, in many foreign countries. Most registrations can be renewed perpetually at 10-year intervals. We also license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

Although our portfolio of patents is growing, the patents that have been issued to us could be determined to be invalid and may not be enforceable against competitive products in every jurisdiction. In addition, third parties have asserted and may, in the future, assert infringement claims against us and our customers. These claims and any litigation may result in invalidation of our proprietary rights or a finding of infringement along with an assessment of damages. Litigation, even if without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. In addition, third-party licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially acceptable terms, or at all.

HUMAN CAPITAL

We consider our employees one of our four True North key stakeholders because they help us deliver for the customers, shareholders and the communities we serve. As of July 31, 2021, we had approximately 13,500 employees in 10 countries. During fiscal 2021, we employed on average approximately 7,700 seasonal employees from January to May primarily to support our Consumer segment customers during the peak of tax season. We believe our future success and growth will depend on our ability to attract and retain a qualified workforce in all areas of our business. 

Intuit’s workforce development strategies are developed and managed by our Chief People & Places Officer, who reports to the CEO. The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee of the Board of Directors has oversight with respect to company-wide organization and talent assessment, employee recruitment, engagement and retention, leadership development, management depth and strength assessment, workplace environment and culture, employee health and safety, and pay equity. Of the total number of employees, approximately 1,300 are employed by Credit Karma, which was acquired by Intuit in December 2020 and has certain unique compensation and workforce development programs. We regularly collect, measure and share the sentiment of our workforce through multiple channels, including engagement surveys, and other touch points, which help to guide the work we do to support our workforce. 

Culture and Values

In order to deliver on our mission to power prosperity around the world, we are guided by our company values as we strive to create a culture where employees can do the best work of their lives. Our value of Courage means being bold and fearless in how we think and act, holding a high bar for performance and valuing speed, a bias for learning and action. Our value of Stronger Together means championing diversity, inclusion and a respectful environment, thriving on diverse voices to challenge and inform decisions and delivering exceptional work so others can count on us. Consistent with our value of We Care and Give Back, we provide eligible full-time employees five days of paid time off every year that can be used to do volunteer work during normal work hours for vetted non-profits. Our We Care and Give Back program also provides donation matching up to an annual limit. 

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion1

At the foundation of our culture is a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”). We believe that diversity is a fact, but treating people equitably and inclusively are choices we make. To deliver for our customers, we seek to foster a workforce that is as diverse as the communities we serve. When we do this, we believe we develop deeper empathy, accelerating innovation to solve the biggest problems our customers face. We have had a designated role dedicated to diversity and inclusion since 2015. In fiscal 2021, we invested additional resources into DEI and appointed our first Chief Diversity, Equity & Inclusion Officer (“CDEIO”) who leads a new dedicated and specialized team in our DEI efforts. Our Compensation and Organizational Development Committee oversees Intuit’s DEI initiatives in support of organizational development. Our strategy is operationalized through the following elements:

•Goals and transparency: We have set short- and long-term goals for increasing the representation of women and under-represented minorities (which we define as Black/African-American, Latino/Hispanic, Native American, Native Alaskan and Native Hawaiian) in our workforce. Our progress is reviewed monthly with all executives and we have shared our diversity externally since 2015;

•Center of Excellence: We have a cross-functional team led by the CDEIO with expertise in enterprise leadership, strategy, human resources and communications all focused on driving a more diverse and inclusive workplace;

•Employee Resource Groups: 13 employee resource groups aid in creating community, recruiting, on-boarding and providing safe spaces for our diverse workforce;

•REAL Team: A Racial Equity Leadership Team focused on helping us drive durable change as we strive to continue advancing racial equity and equality;

•Assessment: Biannual formal talent reviews, including succession plans and diversity assessments;

•Talent acquisition: We have developed a program team to drive diversity strategy and initiatives; and

•Accountability: The Compensation and Organizational Development Committee reviews our progress towards our goals and workforce diversity initiatives at least annually.

As of July 31, 2021:

•Women constituted 40% of our total employees, 35% of our leadership roles, and 30% of our technology roles; and

•Our under-represented minority employees represent 13% of our U.S. employees, 8% of our U.S. leadership roles, and 7% of our U.S. technology roles.

The company performs an ongoing pay equity analysis, conducted twice a year by an independent, third-party vendor. This analysis allows us to review each job code where there are enough employees that have the same or similar job duties and compensation mix. We compare base pay by gender and ethnicity, while factoring in location and time spent in the role, and make adjustments when there are unexplained statistical differences. We are transparent about our pay equity results and have multiple avenues for employees to use for any questions about their pay. 

Developing Talent and Training 

We are committed to creating a high-performing culture that consistently delivers for our customers, shareholders and communities while providing an experience for our workforce that values leadership, innovation, and collaboration. We promote the development of all of our employees through our One Intuit Learning Vision that every employee has a personalized learning plan based on their needs and interests, and are provided the resources they need to grow, thrive and reinvent themselves over time. 

In addition, we are invested in growing our current and future leaders. Our Learning and Development teams design programs and resources to develop our employees and measure their progress. 

All full-time employees have access to opportunities to develop and learn through over 1,400 Intuit-sponsored learning paths and online courses on topics ranging from artificial intelligence to manager essentials in support of an employee’s ability to adapt to any work environment. In fiscal 2021, our full-time employees completed over 170,000 pieces of learning content.

Employees set goals and measure progress through our goal setting tool and have opportunities to focus on growth both during year-end conversations and ongoing monthly check-ins.

Total Rewards 

Our compensation philosophy aims to attract and retain top talent for today and the future. Intuit’s total target compensation includes base hourly pay or salary at market-competitive rates, equity and a range of incentive plans that vary based on role. Incentive compensation plans are part of our pay for performance philosophy and closely align with company performance and reward top performance. Most year-round employees are eligible for equity, which allows the majority of our employees to share in the company’s success.

Additional benefits and rewards include an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and retirement benefits, paid time off, annual paid recharge days, family and parental leave.

COVID Response and Well-being 

The health and well-being of our employees and their families has never been more important. We offer our employees (excluding experts) a reimbursement incentive to cover the costs of purchases made to support their physical, emotional and financial well-being. Employees also have access to other resources to help with their well-being, including a well-minds program for resilience, mindfulness and counseling, back-up childcare, financial education programs and access to an Employee Assistance Program. 

Amid the unprecedented environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, management’s top priority has been the health and safety of our employees. We shifted nearly all our workforce from office locations to work from home environments. We also increased leave benefits for all employees to allow them to take care of what matters most to them. We provided our
