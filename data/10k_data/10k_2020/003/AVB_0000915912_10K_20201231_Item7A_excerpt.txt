ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates. We do not have exposure to any other significant market risk. We monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates, primarily in short-term LIBOR and the SIFMA index as a result of borrowings under our Credit Facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates. In addition, the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates. The effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy.

We currently use interest rate protection agreements (consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements) for our risk management objectives, as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders, and not for trading or speculative purposes. During 2020, we settled an aggregate of $600,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with our February 2020 and May 2020 unsecured note issuances, of which $250,000,000 had been entered into during 2020. During 2020, we entered into an additional $150,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2021. Based on changes in our expected capital needs in 2021 as of December 31, 2020, while we may still issue debt in 2021, it is no longer probable that we will issue the debt for which the Swaps were executed, and as a result, we ceased hedge accounting.

In addition, we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing. Further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had $720,850,000 and $1,026,150,000, respectively, in variable rate debt outstanding, with no amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2020 and 2019, our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately $8,289,000 and $11,221,000, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years.

Because the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider.

In addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes, considering our current market yields, which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt securities and notes payable (including amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility) with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $7,629,814,000 at December 31, 2020 had an estimated aggregate fair value of $8,315,775,000 at December 31, 2020. Contractual fixed rate debt represented $7,692,497,000 of the fair value at December 31, 2020. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of December 31, 2020, the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately $1,224,574,000.
