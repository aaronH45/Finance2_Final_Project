Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

​

Interest rate risk:

We are subject to interest rate risk to the extent we borrow against our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) with variable interest rates based on either an Alternative Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate, as defined in the credit agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2020, we had no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility.

​

We had outstanding fixed rate debt of $4.2 billion and $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fair value of our fixed rate debt was estimated at $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was determined by reference to quoted market prices.

​

Cash equivalents risk:

We invest certain of our excess cash balances in short-term, highly-liquid instruments with maturities of 90 days or less. We do not expect any material losses from our invested cash balances and we believe that our interest rate exposure is minimal. As of December 31, 2020, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $465.6 million.

​

Foreign currency risk:

Foreign currency exposures arising from transactions include firm commitments and anticipated transactions denominated in a currency other than our entities’ functional currencies. To minimize our risk, we generally enter into transactions denominated in the respective functional currencies. Our foreign currency exposure arises from Mexican peso-denominated revenues and profits and their translation into U.S. dollars.

​

We view our investments in Mexican subsidiaries as long-term. The net asset exposure in the Mexican subsidiaries translated into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rates was $149.2 million at December 31, 2020. The year ended December 31, 2020, exchange rates of the Mexican peso with respect to the U.S. dollar decreased by approximately 5% from December 31, 2019. The potential loss in value of our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries resulting from a 10% change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates at December 31, 2020, would be approximately $13.6 million. Any changes in our net assets in the Mexican subsidiaries relating to foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected in the financial statement through the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income, unless the Mexican subsidiaries are sold or otherwise disposed. A 10% change in average exchange rates would not have had a material impact on our results of operations.
