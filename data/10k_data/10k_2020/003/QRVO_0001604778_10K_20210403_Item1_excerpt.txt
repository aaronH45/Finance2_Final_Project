Industry Trends

Global demand for ubiquitous, always-on connectivity continues to increase, driving data traffic over wireless and wired networks. To keep pace with this demand, wireless and wired markets are undergoing multiyear technology upgrade cycles.

Cellular operators are migrating to 5G to improve efficiency, increase data throughput, reduce signal latency and enable massive machine-to-machine connectivity. Because 5G networks operate on different frequencies (low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum) and because they coexist with prior cellular standards, 5G deployments are increasing the content opportunity for Qorvo's high-performance gallium nitride ("GaN"), gallium arsenide ("GaAs"), and bulk acoustic wave ("BAW") infrastructure RF products.

Smartphone original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") are adopting 5G to reduce the total cost of the delivery of data (cost/bit), increase network throughput, enable more network devices or “nodes,” and enhance how users connect, communicate and transact business. 5G architectures are more complex than 4G architectures and can 

4
include Multiple-Input/Multiple-Output (“MIMO”), transmit in the diversity path, higher frequencies with wider bandwidths and new receive paths featuring carrier aggregation (“CA”). The increased functionality is expected to add RF content and the added complexity favors best-in-class, highly integrated RF solutions. 5G smartphone units are forecast to approximately double in calendar year 2021. Beyond smartphones, 5G enables new use cases in autonomous vehicles, augmented/virtual reality, and connected IoT devices powering smart homes and smart cities, which is increasing the content opportunity for Qorvo’s high-performance GaAs, silicon on insulator ("SOI"), and BAW cellular RF products.

In Wi-Fi, network and device OEMs are migrating to next-generation standards, Wi-Fi 6 and 6E, to support the higher wireless data demand, while the new standards are enabling new IoT use cases. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission approved the use of 5.9 GHz to 7.1 GHz for Wi-Fi 6E, and additional countries are making spectrum available for Wi-Fi 6E. The multiyear upgrade to Wi-Fi 6 and 6E and the addition of new use cases are increasing the content opportunity for Qorvo’s high-performance Wi-Fi RF solutions. 

In IoT, an expanding set of applications, from industrial equipment to wearable fitness trackers, are expected to comprise billions of connected intelligent devices that sense, process and communicate data. Given the diversity of applications and protocols, this is increasing the content opportunity for Qorvo’s multi-protocol (Bluetooth® Low Energy, Zigbee and Thread) ultra-low power wireless solutions. Also, there is increasing demand for secure and accurate location and data communication services, and this is increasing the content opportunity for Qorvo’s high-performance UWB solutions. 

In defense and aerospace applications, the trend toward phased array radar, the shift to higher frequencies and the sharing of existing frequency bands with cellular communications are each expanding the demand for Qorvo’s high-performance defense RF technologies and solutions.

Markets

Our business is diversified primarily across the following end markets: mobile devices; cellular base stations; defense and aerospace; Wi-Fi customer premises equipment; smart home; automotive; power management; and other markets. 

Mobile Devices

Our largest market, mobile devices, includes smartphones, wearables, laptops, tablets and other devices. This market is characterized by increasing demand for data throughput, the transition to 5G cellular technology and the proliferation of new communication and location-based services. 

There are three major use cases for 5G: enhanced mobile broadband, ultra-low latency, and massive machine-to-machine. Enhanced mobile broadband enables faster data speeds and greater capacity. Ultra-low latency enables real-time, mission critical applications, including autonomous driving, industrial robotics and remote medical care. Massive machine-to-machine enables billions of devices to connect on a single network, to sense, communicate and process on a scale not previously possible. 

The transition to 5G involves advanced RF modulation across a wide range of frequency bands, including low-band, mid-band (“sub-7 GHz”) and high-band spectrum (millimeter wave). 5G architectures introduce a series of challenges related to coexistence, signal integrity, efficiency and system complexity. 

To address these challenges, mobile device manufacturers require best-in-class highly integrated RF solutions. Qorvo invests in semiconductor technology leadership, advanced packaging capabilities and systems-level expertise to provide customers high-performance discrete and highly integrated RF solutions that solve their most critical RF challenges. To enable secure precision-location services, mobile devices are adopting UWB technology, given its superior location accuracy, reliability and security versus other short-range technologies.

5

We also engage directly with defense customers to develop next-generation semiconductor and packaging technologies.

Wi-Fi Customer Premises Equipment

Wi-Fi customer premises equipment includes routers, gateways and enterprise infrastructure. In this market, consumer and enterprise customers want broader Wi-Fi coverage and faster and more reliable connectivity for video streaming, augmented/virtual reality and other services, often in high density user environments. The evolution of the Wi-Fi standard from 802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5) to 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), and more recently the addition of Wi-Fi 6E, are standard changes to help meet consumer data demands. Wi-Fi is adopting higher order MIMO architectures to maximize range and capacity. With each new standard and architecture, there are new and more complex requirements for more complex RF front end solutions. 

Smart Home 

Smart home systems can be connected wirelessly to allow remote access and control of various household functions, enhancing convenience, entertainment, security and comfort. Smart home devices can be controlled through a computer, smartphone or through a direct peer-to-peer connection such as a voice-enabled remote control. These devices use industry-standard technologies, such as Bluetooth® Low Energy, Zigbee, and Thread to link to a central gateway that accesses the internet via Wi-Fi. Manufacturers of smart home platforms prefer standards-agnostic, multi-protocol solutions that enable coexistence of multiple radios and deliver extended battery life in a compact form factor.

Automotive

Next-generation wireless technologies are enabling new use cases in automotive wireless connectivity, including vehicle-to-everything ("V2X") applications which facilitate direct, high-speed communication. These new use cases require complex RF solutions spanning multiple protocols, including GPS, satellite radio, Long-Term Evolution ("LTE"), Wi-Fi, 5G (sub-7 GHz and millimeter wave) and UWB. In automotive applications, UWB enables more secure access than current technologies.

Power Management

Power efficiency is a core requirement in all electronics. With the trend toward more battery-operated portable devices, power management is increasingly critical to enhancing efficiency and extending battery life. Power management solutions provide customers digital control of analog power, minimize energy use, significantly reduce solution size and cost, and improve system reliability. Our advanced power management solutions are supporting the migration of consumer products to more efficient brushless DC motors and the transition of compute and storage to more responsive and reliable solid state drives. 

Other Markets

Other markets in which we compete include broadband cable, point-to-point radio and biotechnology testing. In broadband cable, our DOCSIS 3.1 solutions increase bandwidth to the home to optimize upstream and downstream data connectivity. In UWB, our precision-location solutions enable secure association, navigation and location for a range of IoT applications. In emerging applications, we have developed RF-based biotechnology testing solutions using our bulk acoustic wave technology. Our technology is currently used in veterinarian applications. We plan to use our technology for human applications, beginning with COVID-19 antigen testing, given our recent emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Research and Development

We invest in research and development ("R&D") to develop advanced technologies and products necessary to serve our markets. Our R&D activities typically support large competitive design win opportunities for major programs at key customers, which require best-in-class performance, size, cost and functional density. We also invest in R&D to develop new products for broader market applications. Our R&D efforts require us to focus on both continuous improvement and innovation in fundamental areas including materials, software, semiconductor process technologies, simulation and modeling, systems architecture, circuit design, device packaging, module integration and test. 

We have developed multiple generations of GaAs, GaN, BAW and surface acoustic wave ("SAW") process technologies that we manufacture. We invest in these technologies to improve device performance, reduce die size and reduce manufacturing costs. We also help develop and qualify technologies in cooperation with key suppliers, 

7
including SOI and microelectromechanical system ("MEMS") technology for switches and tuners, silicon germanium ("SiGe") for amplifiers, and bulk complementary metal oxide semiconductor ("CMOS") for power management devices and SoC solutions. We combine these technologies with proprietary design methods, intellectual property ("IP") and other expertise to improve performance, increase integration and reduce the size and cost of our products.

We develop and qualify advanced packaging technologies to reduce component size, improve performance and reduce package costs. We also invest in large scale module assembly and test capabilities to bring these technologies to market in very high volumes.

Raw Materials 

We purchase numerous raw materials, passive components and substrates for our products and manufacturing processes. In our GaN and GaAs manufacturing operations, we use several raw materials, including GaN on silicon carbide wafers and GaAs wafers. In our acoustic filter manufacturing operations, raw materials include silicon, lithium niobate and lithium tantalate. The silicon devices in our products are sourced from foundries.

Our manufacturing strategy includes a balance of internal and external capacity. Our manufacturing sites are geographically distributed, as are our suppliers. We routinely qualify additional manufacturing sites and sources of supply to reduce the risk of supply interruptions or price increases, and we closely monitor our suppliers’ key performance indicators. We seek to ensure that materials and manufacturing services are available from multiple sources.

During fiscal 2021, the semiconductor industry experienced supply constraints for certain items, including capacitors, laminates and silicon. We expect the industry to address these constraints over time. In addition, we have long-term strategic partnerships, and we are able to add suppliers, redesign products using alternate materials, qualify multiple silicon foundries, and extend or add supply commitments, to provide flexibility in our supply chain.

Manufacturing 

The majority of our products are multi-chip modules utilizing multiple semiconductor and acoustic material processing technologies. These products have varying degrees of complexity and contain semiconductors and other components that are manufactured internally or sourced from outside supply chain partners. 

We operate wafer fabrication facilities for the production of BAW, GaN, GaAs, SAW and TC-SAW wafers in North Carolina, Oregon and Texas. We also use multiple silicon-based process technologies, including SOI, SiGe and bulk CMOS, which are principally sourced from leading silicon foundries located throughout the world. We have a global supply chain and ship millions of units per day.

We have our own flip chip, wire bond and wafer-level packaging ("WLP") technologies. We primarily use internal assembly facilities in China, Costa Rica, Germany and the U.S., and we also use external suppliers for these and other packaging technologies.

Manufacturing yields can vary significantly between products, based on a number of factors, including product complexity, performance requirements and the maturity of our manufacturing processes. To maximize wafer yields and quality, we test products multiple times, maintain continuous reliability monitoring and conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the production flow. 

Our internal manufacturing facilities require a high level of fixed costs, consisting primarily of occupancy costs, maintenance, repair, equipment depreciation, and labor costs related to manufacturing and process engineering.

Semiconductor fabrication requires highly controlled and clean environments. Die on a wafer can be found to be nonfunctional or wafers can be rejected due to a number of reasons, including minute impurities, variances in the fabrication process or defects in the masks used to transfer circuit patterns onto the wafers.

Our manufacturing facilities worldwide are certified to the ISO 9001 quality standard, and select locations are certified to additional automotive (IATF 16949), aerospace (AS 9100) and environmental (ISO 14001) standards. 

8
These stringent standards are audited and certified by third-party auditors in addition to our continuous internal self-audits. The ISO 9001 standard is based on a number of quality management principles including a strong customer focus, the motivation of top management, the process approach and continual improvement. IATF 16949 is the highest international quality standard for the global automotive industry and incorporates specific additional requirements for the automotive industry. AS 9100 is the standardized quality management system for the aerospace industry. ISO 14001 is an internationally agreed upon standard for an environmental management system. We require that all of our key vendors and suppliers be compliant with select standards, as applicable.

We design, develop, manufacture and market products for leading U.S. and international OEMs and original design manufacturers ("ODMs"). We also collaborate with leading reference design partners. 

We provide products to our largest end customer, Apple Inc. ("Apple"), through sales to multiple contract manufacturers, which in the aggregate accounted for 30% and 33% of total revenue in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and affiliates ("Huawei") accounted for less than 5% of total revenue in fiscal 2021 and 10% of total revenue in fiscal 2020. These customers primarily purchase RF solutions for a variety of mobile devices. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this report for further information. 

Some of our sales to overseas customers are subject to export licenses or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. Department of Commerce (see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A set forth in this report).

Sales and Marketing

We sell our products worldwide directly to customers as well as through a network of U.S. and foreign sales representative firms and distributors. We select our domestic and foreign sales representatives based on technical skills and sales experience, the presence of complementary product lines and the customer base served. We provide ongoing educational training about our products to our internal and external sales representatives and distributors. We maintain an internal sales and marketing organization that is responsible for key account management, application engineering support for customers, sales and advertising literature, and technical presentations for industry conferences. Our sales and customer support centers are located near our customers throughout the world.

Our website contains extensive product information and includes an online store where customers can learn about our products, download product catalogs, order product samples and request evaluation boards. Our global team of application engineers interacts with customers during all stages of design and production, maintains regular contact with customer engineers, provides product application notes and engineering data, and assists in the resolution of technical problems. We maintain close relationships with our customers and platform providers and provide them strong technical support to help anticipate future product needs and enhance their customer experience. 

Seasonality

Our sales are the result of standard purchase orders or specific agreements with customers. Historically, we have experienced seasonal fluctuations in the sale of mobile products, with revenue typically strongest in our second and third fiscal quarters. 

Competition

We operate in a competitive industry generally characterized by rapid advances in technology and new product introductions. Our customers’ product life cycles can be short, and our competitiveness depends on our ability to improve our products and processes faster than our competitors, anticipate changing customer requirements and successfully develop and launch new products while reducing our costs. Our competitiveness is also affected by the quality of our customer service and technical support and our ability to design customized products that address each customer’s particular requirements. The selection process for our products is highly competitive, and our customers provide no guarantees that our products will be included in the next-generation of products introduced.

MP competes primarily with Broadcom Inc.; Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd.; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Qualcomm Technologies, Inc.; and Skyworks Solutions, Inc. IDP competes primarily with Analog Devices, Inc.; Cree, Inc.; MACOM Technology Solutions Inc.; NXP Semiconductors N.V.; Silicon Laboratories Inc.; Skyworks Solutions, Inc.; STMicroelectronics N.V.; and Sumitomo Electric Device Innovations.

Many of our current and potential competitors have entrenched market positions and customer relationships, established patents and other IP and substantial technological capabilities. In some cases, our competitors are also our customers or suppliers. Additionally, many of our competitors may have significant financial, technical, manufacturing and marketing resources, which may allow them to more quickly implement new technologies and develop new products.

Intellectual Property

Our IP, including patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, is important to our business, and we actively seek opportunities to leverage our IP portfolio to promote our business interests. We also actively seek to monitor and protect our global IP rights and to deter unauthorized use of our IP and other assets. Such efforts can be difficult because of the absence of consistent international standards and laws. Moreover, we respect the IP rights of others and have implemented policies and procedures to mitigate the risk of infringing or misappropriating third-party IP.

Patent applications are filed within the U.S. and in other countries where we have a market presence. On occasion, some applications do not mature into patents for various reasons, including rejections based on prior art. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect IP rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. We have approximately 2,180 patents that expire from 2021 to 2041. We also continue to acquire patents through acquisitions or direct prosecution efforts and engage in licensing transactions to secure the right to use third-parties’ patents. In view of our rapid innovation and product development and the comparative pace of governments’ patenting processes, there is no guarantee that our products will not be obsolete before the related patents expire or are granted. However, we believe the duration and scope of our most relevant patents are sufficient to support our business, which as a whole is not significantly dependent on any particular patent or other IP right. As we expand our products and offerings, we also seek to expand our patent prosecution efforts to cover such products. 

We periodically register federal trademarks, service marks and trade names that distinguish our product brand names in the market. We also monitor these marks for their proper and intended use. Additionally, we rely on non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements to protect our interest in confidential and proprietary information that gives us a competitive advantage, including business strategies, unpatented inventions, designs and process technology. Such information is closely monitored and made available only to those employees whose responsibilities require access to the information.

Human Capital

We believe that our employees are our greatest assets, and we must continue to attract, develop, retain and motivate our employees to remain competitive and execute our business strategy. We strive to meet these objectives by offering competitive pay and benefits in a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, and by providing opportunities for our employees to grow and develop their careers. 

As of April 3, 2021, we had approximately 8,400 employees and approximately 700 temporary employees in 21 countries. By region, approximately 50% of our total employees are located in the United States, 41% in Asia, 5% in Europe and 4% in Costa Rica. By major job function, approximately 58% are engineering or technician roles, 26% are manufacturing, and 16% are professional or other administrative. 

Competitive Pay and Benefits

We provide compensation and benefit packages that we believe are competitive within the applicable market. We use a combination of compensation and other programs (which vary by region and salary grade) to attract, motivate and retain our employees, including semiannual performance bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, retirement programs, and health and wellness benefits and programs. We benchmark our compensation and benefit packages annually to ensure we remain competitive with our peers and continue to attract and retain talent throughout our organization.

10
Employee Recruitment, Retention and Development

We are committed to recruiting, hiring, retaining, promoting and engaging a diverse workforce to best serve our global customers. We have established relationships with professional associations and industry groups to proactively attract talent, and we partner with universities to recruit undergraduate and graduate students for our internship program and entry level positions. We also invest in employee development programs to provide employees with the training and education they need to help achieve their career goals, build relevant skills, and lead their organizations. 

We believe our competitive compensation and benefit programs, along with career growth and development opportunities offered by us, promote longer employee tenure and reduce turnover. We monitor employee turnover rates as our success depends upon retaining and investing in our highly skilled manufacturing and technical staff. Our global attrition rate has consistently been below the technology industry average.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

At Qorvo, we value the uniqueness that an inclusive and diverse global team brings to our company, and we are focused on creating an environment that leverages the perspectives and contributions of each employee. Diversity, equity and inclusion principles are included in our workplace training, activities, guidelines, processes and programs. Employees are equipped with the knowledge and capabilities to welcome and embrace diversity and advocate for inclusion. Through employee-driven groups called Qorvo Employee Networks, our employees have an opportunity to connect through shared interests and goals, and spur growth through professional and personal development. These and other efforts help foster an inclusive workplace of talented employees and drive employee engagement. 

Safety, Health and Wellness 

We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance ("RBA"), an industry coalition dedicated to driving sustainable value for workers in global supply chains, among other things. As an RBA member, we have adopted the RBA Code of Conduct, which establishes standards to ensure that working conditions are safe, that employees are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. The RBA Code of Conduct has been reflected in our other employee policies and procedures. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced business travel and instituted comprehensive safety protocols for all Qorvo facilities. We successfully transitioned a significant number of our employees to work from home and we invested in additional wellness benefits, including reimbursement programs to help employees improve home workspaces.

As always, we prioritize safe working conditions. We are committed to an injury free workplace and provide dedicated workplace training and leadership support to reduce or eliminate health and safety risks. In fiscal 2021, we achieved a declining injury rate for the third consecutive year and recorded our lowest injury rate in Qorvo's history.

Government Regulations

By virtue of operating our wafer fabrication facilities, we are subject to a variety of extensive and changing domestic and international federal, state and local governmental laws, regulations and ordinances related to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of toxic, volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in the manufacturing process. We pretreat and dispose of our wastewater from our manufacturing facilities to meet or exceed regulatory requirements. Our hazardous waste is only sent to licensed and permitted disposal facilities. State agencies require us to report storage and emissions of environmentally hazardous materials, and we have retained appropriate personnel to help ensure compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. We believe that costs arising from existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations. 

We are an ISO 14001:2015 certified manufacturer with a comprehensive Environmental Management System ("EMS") in place to help ensure control of the environmental aspects of the manufacturing process. Our EMS mandates compliance and establishes appropriate checks and balances to minimize the potential for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.

11
We actively monitor the hazardous materials that are used in the manufacture, assembly and test of our products, particularly materials that are retained in the final product. We have developed specific restrictions on the content of certain hazardous materials in our products, as well as those of our suppliers and outsourced manufacturers and subcontractors. This helps to ensure that our products are compliant with the requirements of the markets into which the products will be sold and with our customers’ requirements. For example, our products are compliant with the European Union RoHS Directive (2011/65/EU on the Restriction of Use of Hazardous Substances), which prohibits the sale in the European Union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing certain families of substances above a specified threshold.

Historically, the costs to comply with applicable environmental regulations have not been material, and we currently do not expect the costs of complying with existing environmental regulations to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or financial condition in fiscal 2022.

We are also subject to import/export controls, tariffs and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in countries in which we have operations or otherwise do business. These controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions (including those related to, or affected by, United States-China relations, as discussed below in Item 1A, Risk Factors) may have a material impact on our business, including our ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components.

Government regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements or whether our compliance with such regulations will materially impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.
