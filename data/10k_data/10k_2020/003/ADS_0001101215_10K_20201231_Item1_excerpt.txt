PART I

​

Item 1.Business.

​

We are a leading provider of data-driven marketing, loyalty and payment solutions serving large, consumer-based industries. We create and deploy customized solutions that measurably change consumer behavior while driving business growth and profitability for some of today’s most recognizable brands. We help our partners create and increase customer loyalty across multiple touch points using traditional, digital, mobile and emerging technologies. Our LoyaltyOne® business owns and operates the AIR MILES Reward Program, Canada’s most recognized loyalty program, and Netherlands-based BrandLoyalty, a global provider of tailor-made loyalty programs for grocers. Our Card Services business is a comprehensive provider of market-leading private label, co-brand, general purpose and business credit card programs, digital payments, including Bread®, and Comenity-branded financial services. 

​

Our client base of more than 900 companies and online merchants consists primarily of large consumer-based businesses, including well-known brands such as Victoria’s Secret, Signet, IKEA, Ulta, Caesars Entertainment, Sephora, Bank of Montreal, Amex Bank of Canada, Sobeys Inc., Shell Canada Products, Rewe and Albert Heijn. Our client base is diversified across a broad range of end-markets, including financial services, specialty retail, grocery and drugstore chains, petroleum retail, home furnishings and hardware, beauty and jewelry, hospitality and travel and telecommunications. We believe our comprehensive suite of payment and marketing solutions offers us a significant competitive advantage, as many of our competitors offer a more limited range of services. We believe the breadth and quality of our service offerings have enabled us to establish and maintain long-standing client relationships.

​

Business Strategy

​

Beginning in 2018, our board of directors undertook a series of strategic initiatives based on an evaluation of the portfolio of businesses that constituted our company. Subsequently, we completed the sale of Epsilon on July 1, 2019 and our Precima® business from the LoyaltyOne segment in January 2020. Additional initiatives to further simplify our business structure as well as focus capital on our highest earning and growth assets remain ongoing. We continue to make strategic investments in people, data management tools and digital capabilities to further improve our competitive position and drive future growth. 

​

These investments also further our objective to make our Card Services segment the best payment and lending solution for traditional retail partners and emerging digital players, growing sales and credit card and loan receivables by making it easier for consumers to finance purchases and make payments wherever they occur— online, in store and in-app. We intend to support and grow alongside our key retail partners with leading product, digital and analytic capabilities to power their business, private label, co-brand, general purpose and business credit cards, point-of-sale lending solutions, installment products and analytical capabilities. We also intend to rebalance our portfolio, prioritizing and investing in profitable, strong performing partners, targeting core and new verticals by improving our cost base and becoming a more efficient cost provider. In addition, we expect to selectively branch into direct-to-consumer lending and payment products for existing cardholders, including debt consolidation products and proprietary credit cards for growth and value retention. We intend to be the best provider of payment solutions and credit to revolving consumers, increasing Comenity’s brand awareness without directly competing with our retail partners. In December 2020, we completed the acquisition of Lon Inc., a technology-driven digital payments company operating under the trademark Bread, offering an omnichannel solution for retailers and platform capabilities to bank partners. Bread’s offerings and on-boarding capabilities enhance the growth prospects of our Card Services’ verticals and increase the addressable market of small- and medium-sized merchants. Bread also offers our existing partners a broader digital product suite and additional white-label product solutions.

Products and Services

​

Our products and services are reported under two segments—LoyaltyOne and Card Services, and are listed below. Effective March 31, 2019, our former Epsilon segment was treated as a discontinued operation, and was subsequently sold on July 1, 2019. Financial information about our segments and geographic areas appears in Note 25, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

LoyaltyOne

​

Our LoyaltyOne clients are focused on acquiring and retaining loyal and profitable customers. We use the information gathered through our loyalty programs to help our clients design and implement effective marketing programs. Our clients within this segment include financial services providers, grocers, drug stores, petroleum retailers and specialty retailers. LoyaltyOne operates the AIR MILES Reward Program and BrandLoyalty.

​

The AIR MILES Reward Program is a full service outsourced coalition loyalty program for our sponsors, who pay us a fee per AIR MILES reward mile issued, in return for which we provide all marketing, customer service, rewards and redemption management. We typically grant participating sponsors exclusivity in their market category, enabling them to realize incremental sales and increase market share as a result of their participation in the AIR MILES Reward Program coalition.

​

The AIR MILES Reward Program enables consumers, referred to as collectors, to earn AIR MILES reward miles as they shop across a broad range of retailers and other sponsors participating in the AIR MILES Reward Program. These AIR MILES reward miles can be redeemed by our collectors for travel or other rewards. Through our AIR MILES Cash program option, collectors can also instantly redeem their AIR MILES reward miles collected in the AIR MILES Cash program option toward in-store purchases at participating sponsors. Approximately two-thirds of Canadian households actively participate in the AIR MILES Reward Program, and it has been named a “most influential” Canadian brand in Canada’s Ipsos Influence Index.

​

The three primary parties involved in our AIR MILES Reward Program are: sponsors, collectors and suppliers, each of which is described below. 

​

Sponsors. Approximately 135 brand name sponsors participate in our AIR MILES Reward Program, including Shell Canada Products, Jean Coutu, Amex Bank of Canada, Sobeys Inc. and Bank of Montreal.

​

Collectors. Collectors earn AIR MILES reward miles at thousands of retail and service locations, typically including any online presence the sponsor may have. Collectors can also earn AIR MILES reward miles at the many locations where collectors can use certain credit cards issued by Bank of Montreal and Amex Bank of Canada. This enables collectors to rapidly accumulate AIR MILES reward miles across a significant portion of their everyday spend. The AIR MILES Reward Program offers a reward structure that provides a quick, easy and free way for collectors to earn a broad selection of travel, entertainment and other lifestyle rewards through their day-to-day shopping at participating sponsors. 

​

Suppliers. We enter into agreements with airlines, manufacturers of consumer electronics, supplier platforms and other providers to supply rewards for the AIR MILES Reward Program. The broad range of rewards that can be redeemed is one of the reasons the AIR MILES Reward Program remains popular with collectors. Hundreds of brands use the AIR MILES Reward Program as an additional distribution channel for these products. Suppliers include well-recognized companies in diverse industries, including travel, hospitality, electronics and entertainment. 

​

BrandLoyalty designs, implements, conducts and evaluates innovative and tailor-made loyalty programs for grocers worldwide. These loyalty programs are designed to generate immediate changes in consumer behavior and are offered through leading grocers across Europe and Asia, as well as around the world. These short-term loyalty programs are designed to drive traffic by attracting new customers and motivating existing customers to spend more because the reward is instant, topical and newsworthy. These programs are tailored for the specific client and are designed to reward key customer segments based on their spending levels during defined campaign periods. Rewards for these programs are sourced from, and in some cases produced by, key suppliers in advance of the programs being offered based on expected demand. Following the completion of each program, BrandLoyalty analyzes spending data to determine the grocer’s lift in market share and the program’s return on investment.

Card Services

​

Our Card Services segment assists some of the best-known retailers in extending their brand through an expanding suite of payment solutions, including private label, co-brand, general purpose and business credit card programs, digital payments, including Bread, and Comenity-branded financial services that can be used by their customers in the store, or through online or catalog purchases. Our partners benefit from customer insights and analytics, with each of our credit card branded programs tailored to our partner’s brand and their unique card members. 

​

Receivables Financing. Our Card Services segment provides risk management solutions, account origination and funding services for our more than 130 private label and co-brand credit card programs, as well as through Bread partnerships, with over 500 online merchants. In 2020, we launched our Comenity-branded general purpose cash-back credit card, an important new product for us to serve and retain our cardholders and capture incremental spend. As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.0 billion in principal receivables from 40.2 million active accounts, with an average balance for the year ended December 31, 2020 of approximately $832 for accounts with outstanding balances. 

​

We process millions of credit card applications each year using automated proprietary scoring technology and verification procedures to make risk-based origination decisions when approving new credit card accountholders and establishing their credit limits. Credit quality is monitored at least monthly during the life of a credit card account. We augment these procedures with credit risk scores provided by credit bureaus. This information helps us segment prospects into narrower risk ranges, allowing us to better evaluate individual credit risk.

​

We use securitization and deposit programs as principal funding vehicles for our credit card and loan receivables. Securitizations involve the packaging and selling of both current and future receivable balances of credit card and loan receivables to a trust, which is a variable interest entity, or VIE. These VIEs are consolidated in our financial statements. 

​

Processing Services. We perform processing services and provide service and maintenance for private label, co-brand, general purpose and business credit card programs and digital payments, including Bread. We use automated technology for bill preparation, printing and mailing, and also offer consumers the ability to view, print and pay their bills online. By doing so, we improve the funds availability for both our clients and for those credit card and loan receivables that we own or securitize. We also provide collection activities on delinquent accounts to support our programs. Our customer care operations are influenced by our retail heritage and we view every customer touch point as an opportunity to generate or reinforce a sale. Our customer care centers are equipped to handle a variety of inquiry types, including phone, mail, fax, email, text and web. We provide focused training programs in all areas to achieve the highest possible customer service standards and monitor our performance by conducting surveys with our clients and their customers. In 2020, for the fifteenth time since 2003, we were certified as a Center of Excellence for the quality of our operations, the most prestigious ranking attainable, by BenchmarkPortal. Founded by Purdue University in 1995, BenchmarkPortal is a global leader of best practices for customer care centers. In 2020, Card Services entered into an agreement to transition its credit card processing services to Fiserv, a leading global provider of payments and financial services technology solutions. With the transition of Card Services’ core processing to Fiserv, we expect to improve our brand partner conversions and speed to market, including the ability to quickly and seamlessly add new products and capabilities that benefit our partners and cardholders. The platform enables efficient integration and use of mobile wallets and virtual cards, while supporting our data and analytics capabilities and improving operational efficiencies, with the integration and transition beginning in 2021.

​

Marketing Services. Through our integrated marketing services, we design and implement strategies that assist our clients in acquiring, retaining and managing valuable repeat customers. Our programs capture transaction data that we analyze to better understand consumer behavior and use to increase the effectiveness of our clients’ marketing activities. We use multi-channel marketing communication tools, including in-store, web, permission-based email, mobile messaging and direct mail to reach our clients’ customers.

​

Digital Offerings. In 2020, we launched our Enhanced Digital Suite, a group of marketing and credit application features to help our brand partners capitalize on the accelerated adoption of e-commerce, by bringing through more qualified applicants, a higher average purchase value, and a higher credit sales conversion rate. Enhanced Digital Suite promotes credit payment options earlier in the shopping experience and pre-screens customers in real-time, allowing for immediate credit approval without leaving the brand partner’s site.

​

5 
During 2020, we also acquired technology-driven digital payments company Lon Inc., operating under the trademark Bread, expanding Card Services’ offerings to include pay-over-time products. Our acquisition of Bread opens new opportunities to leverage our digital offerings to build both strategic technology platform partnerships and more traditional brand partnership sales and loan receivables. Bread's flexible platform and robust suite of application programming interfaces (APIs) allow merchants and partners to integrate point-of-sale financing and other digital payment products, including installment and buy now, pay later solutions. Bread’s offerings and on-boarding capabilities enhance the growth prospects of our Card Services’ verticals and increase the addressable market of small- and medium-sized merchants. At the same time, Bread offers our existing partners a broader digital product suite and additional white-label product solutions.

​

Disaster and Contingency Planning

​

We operate, either internally or through third-party service providers, multiple data processing centers to process and store our customer transaction data. Given the significant amount of data that we or our third-party service providers manage, much of which is real-time data to support our clients’ commerce initiatives, we have established redundant capabilities for our data centers. We have a number of safeguards in place that are designed to protect us from data-related risks and in the event of a disaster, to restore our data centers’ systems.

​

Protection of Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights

​

We rely on a combination of copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information and technology used in each segment of our business. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants and corporate partners, and generally control access to and distribution of our technology, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite the efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain the use of our products or technology that we consider proprietary and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently. We have a number of domestic and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We pursue registration and protection of our trademarks primarily in the United States and Canada, although we also have either registered trademarks or applications pending for certain marks in other countries. No individual patent or license is material to us or our segments other than that we are the exclusive Canadian licensee of the AIR MILES family of trademarks pursuant to a perpetual license agreement with Diversified Royalty Corp., for which we pay a royalty fee. We believe that the AIR MILES family of trademarks and our other trademarks are important for our branding, corporate identification and marketing of our services in each business segment.

​

Competition

​

The markets for our products and services are highly competitive. We compete with marketing services companies, financial institutions, fintechs and payment networks, as well as with the in-house staffs of our current and potential clients.

​

LoyaltyOne. As a provider of marketing services, our LoyaltyOne segment generally competes with advertising and other promotional and loyalty programs, both traditional and online, for a portion of a client’s total marketing budget. In addition, we compete against internally developed products and services created by our existing and potential clients. We expect competition to intensify as more competitors enter our market. Competitors may target our sponsors, clients and collectors as well as draw rewards from our rewards suppliers. Our ability to generate significant revenue from clients and loyalty partners will depend on our ability to differentiate ourselves through the products and services we provide and the attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs to consumers. The continued attractiveness of our loyalty and rewards programs will also depend on our ability to remain affiliated with sponsors and suppliers that are desirable to consumers and to offer rewards that are both attainable and attractive to consumers.

​

Card Services. Our Card Services segment competes primarily with financial institutions whose marketing focus has been on developing credit card programs with large revolving balances. These competitors further drive their businesses by cross-selling their other financial products to their cardholders. We also compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service levels, the breadth of our product and service offerings, technological and integration capabilities, brand recognition and reputation. Our focus has been on targeting specialty retailers and other brand partners that understand the competitive advantage of developing loyal customers. Typically, these partners seek customers that make more frequent but smaller 

6 
transactions at their retail locations. As a result, we are able to analyze transaction data we obtain through managing our lending programs, including customer specific transaction data and overall consumer spending patterns, to develop and implement successful marketing strategies for our clients. As an issuer of private label retail credit cards, co-brand and Comenity general purpose, Visa®, MasterCard® and Discover® credit cards, we also compete with general purpose credit cards issued by other financial institutions, as well as cash, checks and debit cards. As the payments industry continues to evolve, in the future we expect increasing competition with emerging payment technologies from financial technology firms and payment networks. Moreover, some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage.

​

Regulation

​

Federal and state laws and regulations extensively regulate the operations of our bank subsidiaries, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. Many of these laws and regulations are intended to maintain the safety and soundness of Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank, and they impose significant restraints to which other non-regulated companies are not subject. Because Comenity Bank is deemed a credit card bank and Comenity Capital Bank is an industrial bank within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act, we are not subject to regulation as a bank holding company. If we were subject to regulation as a bank holding company, we would be constrained in our operations to a limited number of activities that are closely related to banking or financial services in nature. As a state bank, Comenity Bank is subject to overlapping supervision by the FDIC and the State of Delaware; as an industrial bank, Comenity Capital Bank is subject to overlapping supervision by the FDIC and the State of Utah. Both Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank are under the supervision of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB—a federal consumer protection regulator with authority to make further changes to the federal consumer protection laws and regulations—who may, from time to time, conduct reviews of their practices.

​

Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must maintain minimum amounts of regulatory capital, including maintenance of certain capital ratios, paid-in capital minimums, and an appropriate allowance for loan loss, as well as meeting specific guidelines that involve measures and ratios of their assets, liabilities, regulatory capital and interest rate, among other factors. If Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank does not meet these capital requirements, their respective regulators have broad discretion to institute a number of corrective actions that could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. To pay any dividend, Comenity Bank and Comenity Capital Bank must maintain adequate capital above regulatory guidelines.

​

We are limited under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act in the extent to which we can borrow or otherwise obtain credit from or engage in other “covered transactions” with Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank, which may have the effect of limiting the extent to which Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank can finance or otherwise supply funds to us. “Covered transactions” include loans or extensions of credit, purchases of or investments in securities, purchases of assets, including assets subject to an agreement to repurchase, acceptance of securities as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, or the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance, or letter of credit. Although the applicable rules do not serve as an outright bar on engaging in “covered transactions,” they do require that we engage in “covered transactions” with Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies. Furthermore, with certain exceptions, each loan or extension of credit by Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank to us or our other affiliates must be secured by collateral with a market value ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the loan or extension of credit, depending on the type of collateral.

​

We are required to monitor and report unusual or suspicious account activity as well as transactions involving amounts in excess of prescribed limits under the Bank Secrecy Act, Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, rules, and other regulations. Congress, the IRS and the bank regulators have focused their attention on banks’ monitoring and reporting of suspicious activities. Additionally, Congress and the bank regulators have proposed, adopted or passed a number of new laws and regulations that may increase reporting obligations of banks. We are also subject to numerous laws and regulations that are intended to protect consumers, including state laws, the Truth in Lending Act, as amended by the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, or the CARD Act, Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Fair Credit Reporting Act. These laws and regulations mandate various disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which we may interact with consumers. These and other laws also limit finance charges or other fees or charges earned in our lending activities. We conduct our operations in a manner that we believe excludes us from 

7 
regulation as a consumer reporting agency under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If we were deemed a consumer reporting agency, however, we would be subject to a number of additional complex regulatory requirements and restrictions.

​

Data protection and consumer privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve, increasing restrictions on our ability to collect and disseminate customer information. In addition, the enactment of new or amended legislation or industry regulations pertaining to consumer, public or private sector privacy issues may impact our marketing services, including placing restrictions upon the collection, sharing and use of information that is currently legally available. There are also a number of specific laws and regulations governing the collection and use of certain types of consumer data primarily in connection with financial services transactions that are relevant to our various businesses and services. In the United States, federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, or GLBA, and the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003, as well as similar and applicable state laws, make it more difficult to collect, share and use information that has previously been legally available and may increase our costs of collecting some data. These laws give bank customers, including cardholders and depositors, the ability to “opt out” of having certain information generated by their applicable financial services transactions shared with other affiliated and unaffiliated parties or the public. Our ability to gather, share and utilize this data will be adversely affected if a significant percentage of the consumers whose purchasing behavior we track elect to “opt out,” thereby precluding us and our affiliates from using their data.

​

In the United States, the federal Do-Not-Call Implementation Act makes it more difficult to telephonically communicate with prospective and existing customers. Similar measures were implemented in Canada beginning September 1, 2008. Regulations in both the United States and Canada give consumers the ability to “opt out,” through a national do-not-call registry and state do-not-call registries, of having telephone solicitations placed to them by companies that do not have an existing business relationship with the consumer. In addition, regulations require companies to maintain an internal do-not-call list for those who do not want the companies to solicit them through telemarketing. These regulations could limit our ability to provide services and information to our clients. Failure to comply with these regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties. Further, the Federal Communications Commission has approved interpretations of rules related to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act defining robo-calls broadly, which may affect our ability to contact customers and may increase our litigation exposure.

​

In the United States, the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 restricts our ability to send commercial electronic mail messages, the primary purpose of which is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service, to our customers and prospective customers. The act requires that a commercial electronic mail message provide the customers with an opportunity to opt-out from receiving future commercial electronic mail messages from the sender.

​

In the United States, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA provides individual privacy rights for California consumers and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers and households. The CCPA requires disclosures to consumers about companies’ data collection, use and sharing practices; provides consumers ways to opt-out of certain sales or transfers of personal information; and provides consumers with additional causes of action. The CCPA prohibits companies from discriminating against consumers who have opted out of the sale of their personal information, subject to a narrow exception. The CCPA provides for certain monetary penalties and for enforcement of the statute by the California Attorney General or by consumers whose rights under the law are not observed. It also provides for damages, as well as injunctive or declaratory relief, if there has been unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of personal information due to failure to implement reasonable security procedures. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including a provision to the effect that the CCPA does not apply where the information is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant to the GLBA if the GLBA is in conflict with the CCPA. 

​

In November 2020, California voters passed Proposition 24, known as the California Privacy Rights Act or CPRA. CPRA, which will amend existing CCPA requirements effective January 2023 with a one-year lookback period, includes limitations on the sharing of personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising and the use of “sensitive” personal information; the creation of a new correction right; and the establishment of a new agency to enforce California privacy law. 

​

8 
Further, there continues to be an increased interest in privacy laws at the federal and state levels where legislators are reviewing or proposing the need for greater regulation of the collection, processing, sharing and use of consumer data for marketing purposes or otherwise, including two federal privacy regulations introduced in late 2020. 

​

In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, or PIPEDA, requires an organization to obtain a consumer’s consent to collect, use or disclose personal information. Under this act, consumer personal information may be used only for the purposes for which it was collected. We allow our customers to voluntarily “opt out” from receiving either one or both promotional and marketing mail or promotional and marketing electronic mail. Heightened consumer awareness of, and concern about, privacy may result in customers “opting out” at higher rates than they have historically. This would mean that a reduced number of customers would receive bonus and promotional offers and therefore those customers may collect fewer AIR MILES reward miles. The Government of Canada has created a Digital Charter providing new rights and expectations, including expected changes to PIPEDA. 

​

Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation, or CASL, may restrict our ability to send “commercial electronic messages,” defined to include text, sound, voice and image messages to email, or similar accounts, where the primary purpose is advertising or promoting a commercial product or service to our customers and prospective customers. CASL requires, in part, that a sender have consent to send a commercial electronic message, and provide the customers with an opportunity to opt out from receiving future commercial electronic email messages from the sender.

​

On May 25, 2018, The General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, a European Union-wide legal framework to govern data collection, use and sharing and related consumer privacy rights came into force. The GDPR replaced the European Union Directive 95/46/EC and applies to and binds the EU Member States and the European Economic Area countries, which includes a total of 30 countries. The GDPR details greater compliance obligations on organizations, including the implementation of a number of processes and policies around data collection and use. These, and other terms of the GDPR, could limit our ability to provide services and information to our customers. In addition, the GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance.

​

In general, GDPR, and other European Union and Member State specific privacy and data governance laws, could also lead to adaptation of our technologies or practices to satisfy local privacy requirements and standards that may be more stringent than in the U.S. Similarly, it is possible that in the future, U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may adopt legislation or regulations that impair our ability to effectively track consumers’ use of our advertising services, such as the FTC’s proposed “Do-Not-Track” standard or other legislation or regulations similar to EU Directive 2009/136/EC, commonly referred to as the “Cookie Directive,” which directs EU Member States to ensure that accessing personal information on an internet user’s computer, such as through a cookie, is allowed only if the internet user has given his or her consent. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, ruled the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework invalid, but noted the use of standard contractual clauses for data transfers is still valid. On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom left the European Union and entered into a Brexit transition period. Effective January 1, 2021, the EU and UK have adopted a new agreement providing that all transfers of personal data between stakeholders subject to GDPR and UK entities will not be considered as transfers to a third country provided that the UK’s current data protection scheme stays in place for the designated maximum period of six months through June 30, 2021. It is not yet known what the data protection landscape will look like at the end of the transition period.

​

In addition to the jurisdictions noted above, there is also rapid development of new privacy laws and regulations elsewhere around the globe, including amendments of existing data protection laws, to the scope of such laws and penalties for noncompliance. Failure to comply with these international data protection laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our reputation and subject us to significant penalties.

​

While all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have enacted data breach notification laws, there is no such U.S. federal law generally applicable to our businesses. Data breach notification legislation and regulations relating to mandatory reporting came into force in Canada on November 1, 2018. Data breach notification laws have been proposed widely and exist in other specific countries and jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Legislative and regulatory measures, such as mandatory breach notification provisions, impose, among other elements, strict requirements on reporting time frames and providing notice to individuals.

​

We also have systems and processes to comply with the USA PATRIOT ACT of 2001, which is designed to deter and punish terrorist acts in the United States and around the world, to enhance law enforcement investigatory tools, and for other purposes.

​

Ontario’s Protecting Rewards Points Act (Consumer Protection Amendment), 2016, and additional related regulations, prohibit suppliers from entering into or amending consumer agreements to provide for the expiry of rewards points due to the passage of time alone, while permitting the expiry of rewards points if the underlying consumer agreement is terminated and that agreement provides that reward points expire upon termination. Similar legislation pertaining to the expiry of rewards points due to the passage of time alone is also in effect in Quebec.

​

Human Capital

​

As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 8,000 associates worldwide, with the majority concentrated in the United States and Canada. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop and retain top talent. To support these objectives, we take a holistic approach to our associates’ experience as an employee, recognizing that an engaged workforce drives our long-term growth and sustainability. Our board of directors and designated committees provide the important oversight of our human capital management strategy, including diversity, equity and inclusion, or DE&I, efforts, which are led by our global senior vice president of human resources. The board of directors and relevant committees receive regular updates on human capital trends and developments from senior management and third-party consultants on key human capital matters that drive our ongoing success and performance. 

​

With COVID-19 impacting the majority of 2020, we adapted to support and empower our associates throughout the significant transformation of their work experience. In March 2020, approximately 95% of our total workforce successfully transitioned to working from home with minimal business disruption. Numerous initiatives designed to connect, recognize and engage our workforce in a virtual work environment were implemented, including providing the necessary new technology, support and lines of communications for our associates to be successful in their roles in this unique environment. Recognizing the importance of health and wellbeing on an associate’s ability to do their best work, we provided timely reminders and access to numerous existing and new resources and support, including mental health awareness and counselling, financial education and wellness courses; a variety of online fitness and meditation classes, a fitness cost reimbursement program and other benefits to promote mental and physical health, and overall wellbeing.

​

Additionally during 2020, we took steps to improve the competitiveness of our associate benefits including a comprehensive review and update of associate and executive compensation and bonus structures, the addition of new paid holidays and improved parental leave plans. 

​

Despite various challenges associated with the pandemic, we maintained high levels of associate engagement and retention as well as success with talent acquisition, hiring several top industry leaders in key positions that further supported our transformation initiatives and business priorities. For 2020, we recorded a new associate acquisition rate of approximately 10%, calculated as total external hires divided by average associate headcount, with voluntary turnover at approximately 13%, calculated as total voluntary terminations divided by average associate headcount, across both professional and care center operations. During 2020, the recruitment team focused on reducing geographic barriers in the talent acquisition process, yielding a greater talent pool to fill roles that require specific skills in the competitive market.

​

As part of our broader multi-year business transformation, we formed a “future workforce” steering committee comprised of senior human resources, technology and operations management to develop and execute human capital-intensive strategies to ensure our workforce readiness. New initiatives intended to attract talent, as well as maintain engaged, equipped and empowered associates, include “talent mobility” strategies designed to identify, nurture and grow promising talent in existing channels and identifying cross-functional or non-traditional opportunities for career growth and advancement. Robust training and development remains central to our human capital strategy. Due to the pandemic, all learning and development courses were moved to a virtual environment, which increased the rate of associate participation. In addition to career-oriented training and development, we require certain annual associate training to ensure ongoing adherence to responsible business practices and ethical conduct. 

​

In 2020, we undertook significant steps to improve our commitment to DE&I, starting with a formal process initiated by our president and Chief Executive Officer. Specific actions taken have included executive leadership involvement and accountability; and formation of a DE&I steering committee with clear objectives, including identifying and engaging a third-party, minority-owned DE&I consulting firm to guide our development of a comprehensive, integrated DE&I strategy and measurement framework. Significant progress made over the back half of 2020 includes associate surveys, focus groups and numerous associate “listening sessions” to provide important input on 

10
