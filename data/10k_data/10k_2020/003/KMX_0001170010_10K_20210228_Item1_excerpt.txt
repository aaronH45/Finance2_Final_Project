BUSINESS OVERVIEW

CarMax Background

CarMax, Inc. delivers an unrivaled customer experience by offering a broad selection of quality used vehicles and related products and services at competitive, no-haggle prices using a customer-friendly sales process. We are the nation’s largest and most profitable retailer of used cars, and we sold 751,862 used vehicles at retail during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021. We are also one of the nation’s largest operators of wholesale vehicle auctions, with 426,268 vehicles sold during fiscal 2021, and one of the nation’s largest providers of used vehicle financing, servicing approximately 1,054,000 customer accounts in our $13.85 billion portfolio of managed receivables as of February 28, 2021.

Our omni-channel platform, which gives us the largest addressable market in the used car industry, empowers customers to buy a car on their terms – online, in-store or a seamless combination of both. Customers can choose to complete the car-buying experience in-person at one of our stores; or buy the car online and receive delivery through contactless curbside pickup, available nationwide, or home delivery, available to most customers. 

CarMax was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1996. CarMax, Inc. is a holding company and our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Under the ownership of Circuit City Stores, Inc. (“Circuit City”), we began operations in 1993 with the opening of our first CarMax store in Richmond, Virginia. On October 1, 2002, the CarMax business was separated from Circuit City through a tax-free transaction, becoming an independent, publicly traded company. As of February 28, 2021, we operated 220 used car stores in 106 U.S. television markets. Our home office is located at 12800 Tuckahoe Creek Parkway, Richmond, Virginia.

Impact of COVID-19

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Throughout fiscal 2021, many U.S. states and localities have shelter-in-place orders and occupancy restrictions, impacting the operations of our stores and consumer demand. We have implemented robust plans to reduce the risk of exposure and transmission of the virus in our stores and continue to follow the mandates of public health officials and government agencies. We also launched contactless curbside pickup nationwide to better serve our customers in alignment with enhanced safety practices. In addition, we quickly shifted our wholesale business from in-person to online auctions and kept our appraisal lanes open for customers who wanted or needed to sell their cars. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the rollout of our omni-channel platform, giving us the largest addressable market in the used car industry. Despite the challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, this omni-channel platform is allowing customers to connect and transact with us in more ways than ever. 

The ongoing crisis of COVID-19 continues to evolve. At the end of fiscal 2021, states and localities were in the midst of a vaccine distribution program; however, the ultimate duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain. We continue to actively monitor developments that may cause us to take further actions that alter our business operations. For further discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on our business and fiscal 2021 results, refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

CarMax Business

We operate in two reportable segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance (“CAF”). Our CarMax Sales Operations segment consists of all aspects of our auto merchandising and service operations, excluding financing provided by CAF. Our CAF segment consists solely of our own finance operation that provides financing to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax.

CarMax Sales Operations. Our CarMax Sales Operations segment sells used vehicles, purchases used vehicles from customers and other sources, sells related products and services, and arranges financing options for customers, all for competitive, no-haggle prices. We enable our customers to separately evaluate each component of the sales process based on comprehensive information about the terms and associated prices of each component. Customers can accept or decline any individual element of the offer without affecting the price or terms of any other component of the offer.

Purchasing a Vehicle: 

The vehicle purchase process at CarMax differs fundamentally from the traditional auto retail experience. Our no-haggle pricing removes a frequent customer frustration with the purchase process and allows customers to shop for vehicles the same way they shop for other consumer products. Our omni-channel platform further empowers our customers to buy a car on their own terms – online, in-store, or a seamless combination of both. Customers can choose to complete the car-buying experience in-person at one of our stores; or buy the car online and receive delivery through contactless curbside pickup, available nationwide, or home delivery, available to most customers.

Our omni-channel platform provides multiple ways for our customers to interact with us, including completely online. A customer may interact with our customer experience consultants when communicating with us via phone or text messages. These employees are paid a fixed hourly rate and receive incentive bonuses based on their ability to effectively progress the customer through their car buying journey. Customers may also interact in-person with our sales consultants who are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, thereby earning the same commission regardless of the vehicle being sold, the amount a customer finances or the related interest rate. These pay structures align our associates’ interests with those of our customers, in contrast to other dealerships where sales and finance personnel may receive higher commissions for negotiating higher prices and interest rates, or steering customers to vehicles with higher gross profits.

We recondition every used vehicle we retail to meet our CarMax Quality Certified standards, and each vehicle must pass an inspection before being offered for sale. We stand behind every used vehicle we sell with our Love Your Car Guarantee. This guarantee gives customers the ability to take 24-hour test drives before committing to purchase as well as provides a 30-day/1,500 mile money-back guarantee and a 90-day/4,000-mile limited warranty. Our CarMax Quality Certified standards were developed internally by CarMax and are not affiliated with any third party or original equipment manufacturer program.

We maximize customer choice by offering a large selection of inventory on our lots and by making our nationwide inventory available for viewing on carmax.com as well as our mobile apps. As of February 28, 2021, we had approximately 63,000 saleable retail vehicles in our inventory. Vehicles in-transit or on customer hold are not visible on our website. Upon request by a customer, we will transfer virtually any used vehicle in our inventory. This gives CarMax customers access to a much larger selection of vehicles than any traditional auto retailer. In fiscal 2021, approximately 38% of our vehicles sold were transferred at customer request.

In addition to retailing used vehicles, we sold new vehicles under franchise agreements at two locations during fiscal 2021. During the fourth quarter, we sold the Toyota new car franchise located in Laurel, MD, resulting in one new car franchise remaining at February 28, 2021. 

Selling us a Vehicle:

We have separated the practice of trading in a used vehicle in conjunction with the purchase of another vehicle into two distinct and independent transactions. We will appraise a customer’s vehicle free of charge and make a written, guaranteed offer to buy that vehicle regardless of whether the owner is purchasing a vehicle from us. This no-haggle offer is good for seven days. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the nationwide rollout of our online instant appraisal offer, which quickly gives customers an offer on their vehicle. Early response to this offering has been strong, positioning us to become the largest online buyer of used vehicles from consumers and strengthening our leadership position as the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers. 

Based on age, mileage or condition, fewer than half of the vehicles acquired through our appraisal process meet our retail standards. Those vehicles that do not meet our retail standards are sold to licensed dealers through our wholesale auctions. Unlike many other auto auctions, we own all the vehicles that we sell in our auctions, which allows us to maintain a high auction sales rate. This high sales rate, combined with dealer-friendly practices, makes our auctions an attractive source of vehicles for licensed dealers. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we moved our auctions, previously held at 74 of our 220 stores, to an online platform during fiscal 2021. As of February 28, 2021, our average auction sales rate was approximately 95%.

Financing a Vehicle:

The availability of on-the-spot financing is a critical component of the vehicle purchase process, and having an array of finance sources increases approvals, expands finance opportunities for our customers and mitigates risk to CarMax. Our finance program provides access to credit for customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through both CAF and third-party providers. We believe that our processes and systems, transparency of pricing, and vehicle quality, as well as the integrity of the information collected at the time the customer applies for credit, allow CAF and our third-party providers to make underwriting decisions in a unique and advantageous environment distinct from the traditional auto retail environment. All 

6

finance offers, whether from CAF or our third-party providers, are backed by a 3-day payoff option, which allows customers to refinance their loan with another finance provider within three business days at no charge. 

Related Products and Services: 

We provide customers with a range of other related products and services, including extended protection plan (“EPP”) products and vehicle repair service. EPP products include extended service plans (“ESPs”) and guaranteed asset protection (“GAP”), which is designed to cover the unpaid balance on an auto loan in the event of a total loss of the vehicle or unrecovered theft. Our ESP customers have access to vehicle repair service at each CarMax store and at thousands of independent and franchised service providers. We believe that the broad scope of our ESPs helps promote customer satisfaction and loyalty, and thus increases the likelihood of repeat and referral business. In fiscal 2021, approximately 60% of the customers who purchased a retail used vehicle also purchased an ESP and approximately 20% purchased GAP.

CarMax Auto Finance. CAF provides financing solely to customers buying retail vehicles from CarMax. CAF allows us to manage our reliance on third-party finance providers and to leverage knowledge of our business to provide qualifying customers a competitive financing option. CAF utilizes proprietary scoring models based upon the credit history and other credit data of the customer along with CAF’s historical experience to predict the likelihood of customer repayment. Because CAF offers financing solely to CarMax customers, our scoring models are optimized for the CarMax channel. We believe CAF enables us to capture additional profits, cash flows and sales. After the effect of 3-day payoffs and vehicle returns, CAF financed 42.5% of our retail used vehicle unit sales in fiscal 2021.

CAF also services all auto loans it originates and is responsible for providing billing statements, collecting payments, maintaining contact with delinquent customers, and arranging for the repossession of vehicles securing defaulted loans. 

Competition 

CarMax Sales Operations. The U.S. used car marketplace is highly fragmented, and we face competition from franchised dealers, who sell both new and used vehicles; online sellers; independent used car dealers; and private parties. According to industry sources, as of December 31, 2020, there were over 18,000 franchised dealers in the U.S., who sell the majority of late-model used vehicles. Competition in our industry has evolved with the adoption of online platforms and marketing tools, all of which facilitate increased competition.

Based on industry data, there were approximately 38 million used cars sold in the U.S. in calendar 2020, of which approximately 21 million were estimated to be age 0- to 10-year old vehicles. While we are the largest retailer of used vehicles in the U.S., in calendar 2020, we estimate we sold approximately 3.5% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold on a nationwide basis. We estimate we sold approximately 4.3% of the age 0- to 10-year old vehicles sold in the current comparable store markets in which we operate in calendar 2020, a decline from 4.7% in 2019. We had strong momentum entering the current year and were gaining significant market share up until the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic during the first quarter of fiscal 2021. As markets re-opened and our omni-channel platform launched nationwide, we began gaining market share again, leading to market share gains over the last five months of calendar 2020. Our market share is generally correlated to the length of time we have operated in a given market. Entering new markets could have a dampening effect on our market share given that our initial market share in new markets is generally much lower than our average. 

We believe that our principal competitive advantages in used vehicle retailing include our ability to provide a high degree of customer satisfaction with the car-buying experience by virtue of our competitive, no-haggle prices and our customer-friendly sales process; our breadth of selection of the most popular makes and models available; the quality of our vehicles; our proprietary information systems; the transparency and availability of CAF and third-party financing; the locations of our retail stores; and our commitment to evolving our car-buying experience to meet customers’ changing expectations. We believe our omni-channel platform reinforces our competitive advantages as it empowers customers to buy a car on their own terms, whether completely from home, in-store or through a seamlessly integrated combination of online and in-store experiences. Our diversified business model, combined with our emerging omni-channel experience, is a unique advantage in the used car industry that firmly positions us to continue growing our market share while creating shareholder value over the long-term. We completed our omni-channel rollout in the second quarter of fiscal 2021. We now have a common platform across all of CarMax that leverages our scale, nationwide footprint and infrastructure and empowers our customers to buy a vehicle on their terms.

In addition, we believe our willingness to appraise and purchase a customer’s vehicle, whether or not the customer is buying a car from us, provides a competitive sourcing advantage for retail vehicles. Our high volume of appraisal purchases supplies not only a large portion of our retail inventory, but also provides the scale that enables us to conduct our own wholesale auctions to dispose of vehicles that do not meet our retail standards.

7

Our wholesale auctions compete with other automotive auction houses. In contrast to the highly fragmented used vehicle retail market, the automotive auction market has two primary competitors: Manheim, a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, and KAR Auction Services, Inc., which together represent a large majority of the North American wholesale car auction market. These competitors auction vehicles of all ages, while CarMax’s auctions predominantly sell older, higher mileage vehicles. During fiscal 2021, in response to the impacts of COVID-19, we quickly transitioned our wholesale auctions to an online platform. Once we restart in-person auction operations, we expect to continue to use online wholesale technology by moving to simulcast auctions.

CarMax Auto Finance. CAF operates and is a significant participant in the auto finance sector of the consumer finance market. This sector is primarily comprised of banks, captive finance divisions of new car manufacturers, credit unions and independent finance companies. According to industry sources, this sector represented more than $1 trillion in outstanding receivables as of December 31, 2020. CAF’s primary competitors are banks and credit unions that offer direct financing to customers purchasing used cars. 

We believe that CAF’s principal competitive advantage is its strategic position as the primary finance source for CarMax customers, and that CAF’s primary driver for growth is the growth in CarMax’s retail used unit sales. We periodically test different credit offers and closely monitor acceptance rates and the effect on sales to assess market competitiveness. We also monitor 3-day payoffs, as the percentage of customers exercising this option can be an indication of the competitiveness of our offer.

Products and Services

Retail Merchandising. We offer customers a broad selection of makes and models of used vehicles, including domestic, imported and luxury vehicles, at competitive prices. Our focus is vehicles that are 0 to 10 years old; these vehicles generally range in price from $11,000 to $37,000. The mix of our used vehicle inventory by make, model and age will vary from time to time, depending on consumer preferences, seasonality and market pricing and availability.

Wholesale Auctions. The typical vehicle sold at our wholesale auctions is approximately 10 years old and has more than 100,000 miles. We provide condition disclosures on each vehicle, including those for vehicles with major mechanical issues, possible frame or flood damage, branded titles, salvage history and unknown true mileage. Professional, licensed auctioneers conduct our auctions. Dealers pay a fee to us based on the sales price of the vehicles they purchase. Our auctions are generally held on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. 

Extended Protection Plans. In conjunction with the sale of a vehicle, we offer customers EPP products. We receive revenue for selling these plans on behalf of unrelated third parties, who are the primary obligors. We have no contractual liability to customers for claims under these agreements. The ESPs we currently offer on all used retail vehicles provide coverage up to 60 months (subject to mileage limitations). GAP covers the customer for the term of their finance contract. The EPPs that we sell (other than manufacturer programs on new car sales) have been designed to our specifications and are administered by the third parties through private-label arrangements. Periodically, we may receive profit-sharing revenues based upon the performance of the ESP policies administered by third parties. As of February 28, 2021, our third-party ESP providers included Assurant, Inc., CNA National Warranty Corporation and Fidelity Warranty Services, Inc. Our third-party GAP provider as of February 28, 2021 was Safe-Guard Products International LLC.

Reconditioning and Service. An integral part of our used car consumer offer is the reconditioning process designed to make sure every car meets our internal standards before it can become a CarMax Quality Certified vehicle. This process includes an inspection of the engine and all major systems. Based on this inspection, we determine the reconditioning necessary to bring the vehicle up to our internal quality standards. Many of our stores depend upon nearby, typically larger, CarMax stores for reconditioning, which increases efficiency and reduces overhead. We perform most routine mechanical and minor body repairs in-house; however, for some reconditioning services, including, but not limited to, services related to manufacturer’s warranties, we engage third parties specializing in those services. CarMax does not have manufacturer authorization to complete recall-related repairs, and some vehicles CarMax sells may have unrepaired safety recalls. However, safety recall information, as reported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is available on our website, and we review any unrepaired safety recall information with our used vehicle customers before purchase.

All CarMax used car stores provide vehicle repair service, including repairs of vehicles covered by the ESPs we sell. Additionally, we have partnered with third-party providers of auto service and repair. Through these partnerships, our customers have access to a nationwide network of trusted, quality and fair-priced service and repair locations.

Customer Credit. We offer financing alternatives for retail customers across a wide range of the credit spectrum through CAF and arrangements with several financial institutions. Vehicles are financed using retail installment contracts secured by the 

8

vehicle. As of February 28, 2021, our third-party finance providers included Ally Financial, American Credit Acceptance, Capital One Auto Finance, Chase Auto Finance, Exeter Finance Corp., Santander Consumer USA and Westlake Financial Services. We have no recourse liability for credit losses on retail installment contracts arranged and held by third-party providers, and we periodically test additional third-party providers.

Generally, credit applications submitted by customers to CarMax are initially reviewed by CAF using our proprietary underwriting standards. Based on that review, CAF makes financing offers designed to create a loan portfolio that meets our targeted risk profile in the aggregate. Applications that CAF declines or approves with conditions are generally evaluated by other third-party finance providers. Third-party providers generally either pay us or are paid a fixed, pre-negotiated fee per contract. We refer to the providers who generally pay us a fee or to whom no fee is paid as Tier 2 providers and we refer to providers to whom we pay a fee as Tier 3 providers. We are willing to pay a fee to Tier 3 providers because we believe their participation provides us with incremental sales by enabling customers to secure financing that they may not otherwise be able to obtain. All fees either received or paid are pre-negotiated at a fixed amount and do not vary based on the amount financed, the interest rate, the term of the loan or the loan-to-value ratio. CAF also provides financing for a small percentage of customers who would typically be financed by a Tier 3 provider.

We do not offer financing to dealers purchasing vehicles at our wholesale auctions. However, we have made arrangements to have third-party financing available to our auction customers.

Suppliers for Used Vehicles 

We acquire a significant percentage of our retail used vehicle inventory directly from consumers through our in-store and online appraisal processes, as well as through local, regional and online auctions. While in any individual period conditions may vary, over the past 5 fiscal years, 36% to 41% of our retail inventory has been acquired through our appraisal process annually. We also acquire used vehicle inventory from wholesalers, franchised and independent dealers and fleet owners, such as leasing companies and rental companies. The used vehicle inventory we acquire directly from consumers through our appraisal process helps provide an inventory of makes and models that reflects consumer preferences in each market. 

The supply of late-model used vehicles is influenced by a variety of factors, including the total number of vehicles in operation; the volume of new vehicle sales, which in turn generate used car trade-ins; and the number of used vehicles sold or remarketed through retail channels, wholesale transactions and at automotive auctions. According to industry sources, there were approximately 281 million light vehicles in operation in the U.S. as of December 31, 2020. During calendar year 2020, it is estimated that approximately 14 million new cars and 38 million used cars were sold at retail, many of which were accompanied by trade-ins, and more than 15 million wholesale vehicles were sold at auctions and through other channels.

Based on the large number of vehicles remarketed each year, consumer acceptance of our appraisal process, our experience and success in acquiring vehicles from auctions and other sources, and the large size of the U.S. auction market relative to our needs, we believe that sources of used vehicles will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and future needs.

Seasonality

Historically, our business has been seasonal. Our stores typically experience their strongest traffic and sales in the spring and summer, with an increase in traffic and sales in February and March, coinciding with federal income tax refunds. Sales are typically slowest in the fall. In fiscal 2021, traffic and sales were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during periods of the year when we have historically experienced strong traffic and sales, and it remains unclear how the continuing impact of COVID-19 and related stimulus payments will affect the seasonality of our business.

Technology 

We leverage a combination of cloud-based solutions and proprietary technologies to run our operations. We have a strong software engineering discipline and we have adopted Agile, DevOps, Lean and other leading digital delivery practices. Technology teams are tightly integrated with the rest of the business and part of the cross-functional “Product” teams. Our Product teams use a “test and learn” approach to iterate and deploy new technology-enabled experiences to our associates and customers. CarMax uses advanced data science and machine learning capabilities to optimize our business and the customer experience. Our business is supported by digital and mobile technologies that provide enhanced customer experience while enabling highly integrated automation of all operating functions, including credit processing and supply chain management. Buyers and sales consultants are equipped with mobile and centralized tools that allow them to access real-time information to better serve our customers. Our proprietary digital technology provides our management with real-time information about many aspects of our omni-channel operations, such as inventory management, pricing, vehicle transfers, 

9

wholesale auctions and sales consultant productivity. Real-time access to a complete view of our customer interactions from omni-channel allows our associates to provide a tailored and differentiated experience to our customers.

Our proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system tracks each vehicle throughout the sales process and allows us to buy the mix of makes, models, age, mileage and price points tailored to customer buying preferences at each CarMax location. Leveraging our more than twenty-five years of experience buying and selling millions of used vehicles, our system generates recommended initial retail price points, as well as retail price markdowns for specific vehicles based on algorithms that take into account factors that include sales history, consumer interest and seasonal patterns. We believe this systematic approach to vehicle pricing allows us to optimize inventory turns, which reduces the depreciation risk inherent in used cars and helps us to achieve our targeted gross profit dollars per unit. Because of the pricing discipline afforded by our inventory management and pricing system, generally more than 99% of our entire used car inventory offered at retail is sold at retail.

Marketing and Advertising

Our marketing strategies are focused on developing awareness of the advantages of shopping at our stores and on carmax.com and on attracting customers who are already considering buying or selling a vehicle. These strategies are implemented through a broad range of media types including, but not limited to, traditional broadcast, digital, search, video on demand and social. Our website and related mobile apps received an average of 27 million monthly visits during fiscal 2021 and are marketing tools for communicating the CarMax consumer offer in detail. They are also sophisticated search engines for finding the right vehicle and sales channels for customers who prefer to conduct part of the shopping and sales process online. Our website and mobile apps also include a variety of other customer service features, including the ability to initiate vehicle transfers, schedule appointments and apply for financing pre-approval. Information on the thousands of cars available in our nationwide inventory is updated near real-time. Our survey data indicates that during fiscal 2021, approximately 96% of customers who purchased a vehicle from us had first visited us online. 

In 2019 we introduced a new advertising campaign — The Way It Should Be — highlighting the human element that CarMax provides to the car buying and selling experiences. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we introduced the next phase of this national multi-media marketing campaign to increase awareness of our core omni-channel capabilities, including our Love Your Car Guarantee campaign, highlighting our 24-hour test drives and 30-day/1,500 mile money-back guarantee, aimed at elevating our customers’ confidence in their CarMax vehicle purchase.

Human Capital Resources

CarMax’s purpose, to drive integrity by being honest and transparent in every interaction, is brought to life each day by our associates’ commitment to living our core values. We recognize that our associates are the key to our success, and we are proud to provide an award-winning workplace where we value the diversity and contribution of all associates and foster a culture where associates can achieve their career goals. Our associates are further guided by the policies and procedures we have in place to ensure everyone is treated with respect and has opportunities to reach their full potential. 

On February 28, 2021, we had a total of 26,889 full- and part-time associates, including 21,357 hourly and salaried associates, of which 782 work in our CAF segment. We also had 3,923 in-store sales associates and 1,609 sales associates in our Customer Experience Centers (“CECs”), compared with 4,788 in-store sales associates and 876 CEC sales associates as of February 29, 2020. Our in-store sales associates predominantly work on a commission basis while our CEC sales associates are hourly employees who are incentive eligible. We employ additional associates during peak selling seasons. No associate is subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We annually review our pay in each geographic market to ensure we are providing a fair and competitive wage. We pay the vast majority of our associates $15 or more per hour and offer health and other benefits to all of our full-time associates. 

As we continue to implement our omni-channel car buying experience, the shape of our workforce has evolved. As of February 28, 2021, we had 811 technology, product and data science associates, of which 178 were hired during fiscal 2021 as we accelerated our innovation. In addition, we have enhanced our intern and college hiring program, and put in place a technology reskilling program and a product manager-in-training career path. As part of our standard compensation plan, we provide equity for all roles working on our innovation efforts as a strong engagement and retention tool. As of February 28, 2021, we also had more than 300 contractors assisting us in technology roles. We believe this evolution in our workforce will be critical to the development of our technology platforms and strategic initiatives.

Our commitment to our associates is reflected in our fair and broad-based compensation packages and benefit programs, our continuous investment in talent acquisition, engagement, and development activities, and our comprehensive safety and security program. We review pay equity annually based on objective factors such as position, tenure, and location. If we find 

10

discrepancies that cannot be explained by these objective factors, we make appropriate adjustments. Our goal is to provide equal pay for comparable work regardless of gender, age, race or ethnicity.

We have been recognized for 17 consecutive years as one of Fortune magazine’s 100 Best Companies to Work For® and have also been selected as one of Training magazine’s “Training Top 125” companies for 14 years in a row. These awards reflect our ability to provide associates with the tools they need to succeed and grow in their careers.

We request and utilize regular feedback from our associates. Our goal is to achieve world-class associate engagement and responding to associate feedback allows us to focus on the issues that matter to our associates, as well as support them through the ongoing evolution and organizational changes. 

Diversity and Inclusion. The CarMax culture of diversity and inclusion is built on a foundation of integrity and respect, and we encourage the diverse backgrounds and perspectives our associates bring to locations across the country. Our diversity and inclusion commitment is based on a company vision to ensure everyone, everywhere has the opportunity to reach their full potential. As of February 28, 2021, our non-management workforce was 27% female and 73% male and 47% non-diverse and 53% diverse. The breakdown for our management workforce was 25% female and 75% male and 74% non-diverse and 26% diverse. For purposes of workforce diversity, CarMax considers ethnic and racial minorities as diverse and defines management as director and above at the corporate level and the top four managers at the store-level and CEC-level, as a group. 

In March 2021, we announced updates on our commitment to take a stand against racial injustice and our continued efforts to advance diversity and inclusion in our business. This included beginning close partnerships with several nonprofit organizations who have proven expertise at the forefront of local initiatives in the areas of education, careers, access to credit and financial education, and entrepreneurship. In addition to these partnerships, CarMax has recently done the following:

•Hired a Vice President of Corporate Social Responsibility as well as a Chief Diversity and Inclusion officer to lead overall company vision and strategy for advancement in this area. 

•Established a diversity and inclusion governance model which includes a council and an executive steering committee, of which the CEO is a member. 

•Committed to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge. 

•Launched a company-wide associate education program on diversity and inclusion, including training on unconscious bias. 

•Created educational resources and provided tools for associate-led dialogue around race relations and inclusion opportunities.

•Implemented a quarterly plan for measuring and tracking progress on diversity and inclusion commitments. 

Safety. The safety of our associates and our customers is always a top priority in how we deliver our experiences and serve our communities. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented robust plans to reduce the risk of exposure and transmission at our locations. This includes following the mandates of public health officials and government agencies, launching contactless curbside pickup nationwide, and shifting our wholesale business from in-person to online auctions. Throughout the pandemic, we have remained committed to promoting healthy practices for our associates. 

We are proud of the team of associates who serve our customers each day, and we are constantly looking for ways to ensure we hire, develop, and retain a strong team to support our future growth.

Intellectual Property

Our brand image is a critical element of our business strategy. We rely on trademarks, domain names and copyrights to protect core aspects of CarMax’s look and feel. Innovation and technology also play an increasingly vital role in all aspects of the business. We actively pursue appropriate intellectual property protection for our state-of-the-art work by filing patent applications in areas ranging from vehicle reconditioning and digital merchandising to impact capture and search engine optimization.

Laws and Regulations

Vehicle Dealer and Other Laws and Regulations. We operate in a highly regulated industry. In every state in which we operate, we must obtain licenses and permits to conduct business, including dealer, service, sales and finance licenses issued by state and local regulatory authorities. A wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the manner in which we conduct business, including advertising, sales, financing and employment practices. These laws include consumer protection laws and privacy laws, as well as other laws and regulations applicable to motor vehicle dealers. These laws also include federal and state wage-hour, anti-discrimination and other employment practices laws. Our financing activities with customers are subject to federal truth-in-lending, consumer leasing, equal credit opportunity and fair credit reporting laws and 

11

regulations, as well as state and local motor vehicle finance, collection, repossession and installment finance laws. Our activities are subject to enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission and other federal and state regulators, and our financing activities are also subject to enforcement by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”).

The CFPB has supervisory authority over large nonbank auto finance companies, including CarMax’s CAF segment. The CFPB can use this authority to conduct supervisory examinations to ensure compliance with various federal consumer protection laws. 

Claims arising out of actual or alleged violations of law could be asserted against us by individuals or governmental authorities and could expose us to significant damages or other penalties, including revocation or suspension of the licenses necessary to conduct business and fines.

Additionally, we are subject to laws, regulations, and other governmental actions instituted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other things, these actions have required and may continue to require, in many localities, store occupancy restrictions, store closures and restrictions on in-person wholesale auctions.

Environmental Laws and Regulations. We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations that pertain to the environment. Our business involves the use, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes, including motor oil, gasoline, solvents, lubricants, paints and other substances.
