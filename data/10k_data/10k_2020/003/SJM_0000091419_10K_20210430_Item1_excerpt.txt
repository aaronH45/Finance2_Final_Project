PART I

Item 1. Business. 

The Company: The J. M. Smucker Company (“Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), often referred to as Smucker’s (a registered trademark), was established in 1897 and incorporated in Ohio in 1921. We operate principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food and beverage products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of our sales are in the U.S. Our operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada, although products are exported to other countries as well. Net sales outside the U.S., subject to foreign currency translation, represented approximately 

5 percent of consolidated net sales for 2021. Our branded food and beverage products include a strong portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in North America.

On January 29, 2021, we sold the Natural Balance® premium pet food business to Nexus Capital Management LP (“Nexus”). The transaction included pet food products sold under the Natural Balance brand, certain trademarks and licensing agreements, and select employees who supported the Natural Balance business. Under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $156.7, $222.8, and $274.2 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, included in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. For additional information, refer to Note 4: Divestitures. 

On December 1, 2020, we sold the Crisco® oils and shortening business to B&G Foods, Inc. (“B&G Foods”). The transaction included oils and shortening products sold under the Crisco brand, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, certain trademarks and licensing agreements, dedicated manufacturing and warehouse facilities located in Cincinnati, Ohio, and approximately 160 employees who supported the Crisco business. Under our ownership, the business generated net sales of $198.9, $269.2, and $258.5 in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, primarily included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. For additional information, refer to Note 4: Divestitures. 

On August 31, 2018, we sold our U.S. baking business to Brynwood Partners VII L.P. and Brynwood Partners VIII L.P., subsidiaries of Brynwood Partners, an unrelated party. The transaction included products that were primarily sold in U.S. retail channels under the Pillsbury®, Martha White®, Hungry Jack®, White Lily®, and Jim Dandy® brands, along with all relevant trademarks and licensing agreements, and our manufacturing facility in Toledo, Ohio. This business generated net sales of $105.9 in 2019, primarily included in the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment. The transaction did not include our baking business in Canada. For additional information, refer to Note 4: Divestitures. 

On May 14, 2018, we acquired the outstanding equity of Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, LLC (“Ainsworth”) in an all-cash transaction, which was funded by debt and valued at $1.9 billion. Ainsworth was a leading producer, distributor, and marketer of premium pet food and pet snacks, predominantly within the U.S. The majority of Ainsworth’s sales were generated by the Rachael Ray® Nutrish® brand within the premium pet food category. Results of the Ainsworth acquisition are primarily included in the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment. For additional information, refer to Note 2: Acquisition.

We have three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Pet Foods, U.S. Retail Coffee, and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods. Effective during the first quarter of 2021, the presentation of International and Away From Home represents a combination of all other operating segments that are not individually reportable. As a result of leadership changes, these operating segments are being managed and reported separately and no longer represent a reportable segment for segment reporting purposes. Segment results for prior periods have not been modified, as the combination of these operating segments represents the previously reported International and Away From Home reportable segment. The U.S. retail market segments in total comprised 88 percent of 2021 consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. International and Away From Home represents sales outside of the U.S. retail market segments.

Principal Products: Our principal products as of April 30, 2021, are coffee, dog food, cat food, pet snacks, peanut butter, frozen handheld products, fruit spreads, juices and beverages, portion control products, and baking mixes and ingredients. Product sales information for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 is included within Note 5: Reportable Segments.

In the U.S. retail market segments, our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers, club stores, discount and dollar stores, food wholesalers, online retailers, pet specialty stores, natural foods stores and distributors, drug stores, military commissaries, and mass merchandisers. In International and Away From Home, our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., health care operators, restaurants, lodging, hospitality, offices, K-12, colleges and universities, and convenience stores).

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials: The raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities, agricultural-based products, and packaging materials. Green coffee, peanuts, protein meals, oils and fats, grains, sweeteners, fruit, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability, quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. Futures, options, basis, and fixed price contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs. Green coffee, along with certain other raw materials, is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, plant disease, investor speculation, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. We source peanuts, protein meals, and oils and fats mainly from North America. The principal packaging materials we use are plastic, glass, metal cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate. For additional information on the commodities we purchase, see “Commodities Overview” within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources, although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials and finished goods, such as K-Cup® pods and our Pup-Peroni® dog snacks, from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year-to-year, we believe that we will continue to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are available. We have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. We consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing. 

Trademarks and Patents: Our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries. Our major trademarks as of April 30, 2021, are listed below. 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

 (A) Represents the combined International and Away From Home operating segments. 

Dunkin’ is a trademark of DD IP Holder LLC for packaged coffee products, including K-Cup® pods, sold in retail channels such as grocery stores, mass merchandisers, club stores, e-commerce, and drug stores. Information included in this document does not pertain to coffee or other products for sale in Dunkin’ restaurants. The terms of the Dunkin’ license includes the payment of royalties to an affiliate of DD IP Holder LLC and other financial commitments by the Company. The Dunkin’ license is in effect until January 1, 2039. Keurig® and K-Cup® are trademarks of Keurig Green Mountain, Inc. (“Keurig”), used with permission.

We utilize Rachael Ray’s image and likeness and related Rachael Ray trademarks for premium pet food and pet snacks under an exclusive license which expires in 2063. The terms of the license include the payment of royalties to The Rachael Ray Foundation. Rachael Ray is a trademark of Ray Marks II LLC. In addition, we and our subsidiaries license the use of several other trademarks, none of which are individually material to our business.

Slogans or designs considered to be important trademarks include, without limitation, “With A Name Like Smucker’s, It Has To Be Good®,” “The Best Part of Wakin’ Up Is Folgers In Your Cup®,” “Choosy Moms Choose Jif®,” “That Jif'ing GoodTM,” “The Only One Cats Ask For By Name®,” the Smucker’s banner, the Crock Jar shape, the Gingham design, the Jif Color Banner design, the Folgers Mountain Sunrise design, the Café Bustelo Angelina design, and the Smucker’s Strawberry, Milk-Bone, Meow Mix, and 9Lives logos.

We own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

We consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property, taken as a whole, to be essential to our business. 

Seasonality: The U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments have historically been seasonal around the Fall Bake and Holiday period, which generally resulted in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters. However, as a result of the Crisco and U.S. baking business divestitures during 2021 and 2019, respectively, the U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segment has experienced less seasonality. Additionally, the U.S. Retail Pet Foods segment does not experience significant seasonality, further reducing the overall impact of seasonality to the total Company.

Customers: Sales to Walmart Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to 32 percent of net sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019. These sales are primarily included in our U.S. retail market segments. No other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales for any year. 

During 2021, our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 60 percent of consolidated net sales. Supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors continue to consolidate, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands.

Government Business: No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition: We are the branded market leader in the coffee, dog snacks, peanut butter, fruit spreads, and natural shelf stable juices categories in the U.S. In Canada, we are the branded market leader in the flour, pickles, fruit spreads, canned milk, and ice cream toppings categories. Our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products.

In order to remain competitive, companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences, technological advances, product and packaging innovations, and the growth of certain retail channels, such as the 

e-commerce market. The primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition, product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, advertising, promotion, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include well-recognized brands, high-quality products, consumer trust, experienced brand and category management, a single national grocery broker in the U.S., varied product offerings, product innovation, good customer service, and an integrated distribution network.

The packaged foods industry has been challenged by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store. Certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline, such as a heightened focus on health and wellness, an increased desire for fresh foods, and the growing impact of social media and e-commerce on consumer behavior. To address these dynamics, we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends.

In addition, private label continues to be a competitor in many of the categories in which we compete, partially due to improvements in private label quality and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty. In our total U.S. retail categories, private label held a 12.2 dollar average market share during the 52 weeks ended April 18, 2021, as compared to a 16.4 dollar average market share during the same period in the prior year. The decrease in average market share is primarily driven by excluding the shortening and oils category in 2021, as a result of the Crisco divestiture. We believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the categories in which we compete, appealing to different consumer segments. We closely monitor the price gap, or price premium, between our brands and private label brands, with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets.

Our primary brands and major competitors as of April 30, 2021, are listed below.

Government Regulation: Our operations are subject to various regulations and laws administered by federal, state, and local government agencies in the U.S., including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Departments of Labor and Commerce, and Environmental Protection Agency. Additionally, we are subject to regulations and laws administered by government agencies in Canada and other countries in which we have operations and our products are sold. In particular, the manufacturing, marketing, packaging, labeling, transportation, storage, distribution, and sale of food products are each subject to governmental regulation, encompassing such matters as ingredients, pricing, advertising, relations with distributors and retailers, health, safety, data privacy and security, anti-corruption, and the environment. Additionally, we are subject to tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, including in-house and outside counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the countries in which we do business. We believe we are in compliance with such laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in 2022. 

Environmental Matters: Compliance with environmental regulations and prioritizing our environmental sustainability efforts are important to us as a good corporate citizen. As such, we have public goals related to waste diversion, water usage intensity reduction, greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction, and sustainable packaging. In addition, we have implemented and manage a variety of programs across our operations, including energy optimization, utilization of renewable energy, water conservation, recycling, and partnerships with farmers who implement sustainable practices, in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability. We continue to evaluate and modify our processes to further limit our impact on the environment.

Human Capital Management: Our values and principles are rooted in our Basic Beliefs and serve as the foundation for our strategic and daily decisions. As demonstrated by our Basic Beliefs of Quality, People, Ethics, Growth, and Independence, we are committed to supporting our employees holistically, both personally and professionally. With approximately 7,100 full-time employees worldwide, every Smucker employee makes a difference to our Company. We believe it is critical that we have an inclusive and diverse environment and that we take proactive steps to ensure we meet our employees’ physical, emotional, and financial needs. In order to hold ourselves accountable, we conduct an employee engagement survey every two to three years to provide an opportunity for open and confidential feedback from our employees and identify opportunities for improvement. Additionally, we send out pulse surveys as needed to gain additional information based on responses to the larger engagement survey and other topics that may be immediately applicable. 

Additional information regarding our human capital management is available in our 2020 Corporate Impact Report that can be found on our website at www.jmsmucker.com/news-stories/corporate-publications/corporate-impact-report. Information on our website, including our 2020 Corporate Impact Report, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Health and Wellness: Maintaining a safe and healthy workplace is among our top priorities. We are diligent in ensuring workforce health and safety through education and training which is provided at all locations. These efforts resulted in us achieving a total recordable incident rate during 2021 that is four times below the national average. Further, we have maintained an unwavering commitment to supporting the health and well-being of our employees during the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic. We have implemented extensive safety and sanitation measures to help ensure employee health and well-being, encouraging remote work for all who are able, and introducing protocols in our manufacturing facilities to allow for appropriate social distancing and protection of our employees. Additionally, we are paying 100 percent of the cost for employee COVID-19 testing and providing personal leave to individuals who test positive or have to care for a family member who tests positive. Further, during 2021, we have reinforced the importance of self-care and the availability of mental health resources to our employees.

As part of our focus on well-being, we emphasize the need for our employees to embrace healthy lifestyles. We offer a variety of wellness education opportunities and on-site conveniences, including our wellness facility, fitness center, and Child Development Center, at our corporate headquarters in Orrville, Ohio. Although some facilities were temporarily closed during 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are conducting a phased reopening of these facilities during early 2022. 

Diversity and Inclusion: We believe having an inclusive culture and the expertise of diverse professionals across our business is critical to our success. Our commitment to inclusion, diversity, and equity is focused around three pillars:

•Workforce: promoting a diverse workforce; 

•Workplace: maintaining an inclusive environment for all employees; and 

6

•Marketplace: sharing our efforts with external constituents to support greater cultural awareness and sensitivity in society. 

In support of these pillars, we have accelerated our inclusion and diversity efforts by introducing unconscious bias training and developing employee resource groups to encourage empathy and provide support to our employees. These groups encourage and help employees feel more comfortable bringing their whole selves to work and reinforce our commitment to creating an environment that celebrates the differences that make each of us who we are. 

We approach diversity from the top-down, exemplified by our Board of Directors (the “Board”), where 3 of 12 directors are ethnically diverse and 5 of 12 directors are women. Additionally, 3 of 7 members of our Executive Leadership Team are women, demonstrating our belief that a diverse team with a variety of viewpoints is important and further contributes to a more effective decision-making process and overall greater success. 

Further, in 2021, Mark Smucker signed the “CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion” pledge to publicly demonstrate the importance of ensuring inclusivity in the workplace. Additionally, we will honor Juneteenth as a Company holiday beginning this calendar year. We updated our marketing guidelines to clarify our expectations of our social media partners to eliminate hate speech and discriminatory content from their platforms, resulting in us joining the #StopHateForProfit movement. In June 2020, we committed to providing financial support to non-profit organizations that support education, economic advancement, and justice for minorities. As part of this campaign, we are partnering with the Akron Urban League, the Urban League of Greater Cleveland, the Equal Justice Initiative, the Human Rights Campaign, and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund to further our commitment to this cause. These organizations advocate for inclusion, racial justice, and the advancement of underrepresented people. To ensure ongoing progress against our commitments, we are evaluating our success through several measures, including reviews of organization health assessments, evaluation of workforce composition and minority representation across all levels of the organization, and successful integration of key programming. 

Learning and Development: We strive to foster an environment of growth for our people. We support and challenge our employees to increase their knowledge, skills, and capabilities through all phases of their career. Our Employee Development programs offer foundational instruction on Company culture and provide employees additional learning opportunities throughout their career. We are committed to providing the tools and resources our employees need to learn, develop, and grow with us, including the introduction of virtual sessions in light of current social distancing guidelines. A suite of online training and education programs are available to our employees, ranging from role-specific training to education on soft skills and our Company culture. Our best-in-class “Discovering the Art of Leadership” series, developed in collaboration with Case Western Reserve University, teaches our people managers how to effectively lead teams and develop employees. We dedicate time to developing and coaching our people managers to provide support to our employees holistically. This means promoting resonant leadership and the practice of emotional intelligence and mindfulness so our people managers have the knowledge and tools to support the unique needs of each employee.

Compensation and Benefits: We believe compensating our employees at market competitive rates and with performance-based awards supports the overall well-being of our employees. Our Total Rewards program offers competitive, comprehensive benefits to meet the unique needs of each employee at each life stage, including insurance coverage options for domestic partners in addition to married couples. While our approach to paid time off has always been competitive with our industry peers, in 2020, we increased vacation time for employees with less than five years of tenure to three weeks per calendar year. Further, we increased Company paid parental leave from 2 to 12 weeks, in addition to the up to 12 weeks of short-term disability available to birth mothers. Additionally, we introduced pet bereavement leave to allow pet parents to take a day of leave following the loss of a pet. 

Community and Social Impact: Supporting the communities where we live and work has been a Company priority since our inception. Through our many partnerships, we are able to understand the needs and support required within our local communities and leverage these relationships to make the connections necessary to offer this critical assistance. With our partners, including the American Red Cross®, United Way®, and Habitat for Humanity®, we have helped support disaster relief efforts with product and financial donations. We have supported the LeBron James Family Foundation and its work with the I PROMISE School, including helping supply the school’s on-site food pantry, donating funds to the school’s library, and the development of the I PROMISE School’s J. M. Smucker Hometown Hall. In addition to our employees volunteering time and effort to help their neighbors in need, they also engage in environmental sustainability efforts, such as participating in a virtual Earth Day event.
