Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

The Company is exposed to market risks associated with interest rates, prices of crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, and foreign currency exchange rates. As described in Note M â€“ Financial Instruments and Risk Management, Murphy makes use of derivative financial and commodity instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions.

There were commodity transactions in place at December 31, 2020, covering certain future U.S. crude oil sales volumes in 2021 and 2022. A 10% increase in the respective benchmark price of these commodities would have increased the net payable associated with these derivative contracts by approximately $104.7 million, while a 10% decrease would have decreased the recorded payable by a similar amount, resulting in a receivable. 

There were no derivative foreign exchange contracts in place at December 31, 2020.
