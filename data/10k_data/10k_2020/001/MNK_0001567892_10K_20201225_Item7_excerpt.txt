Item 7.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion may contain forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors and "Forward-Looking Statements" included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Overview

We are a global business consisting of multiple wholly owned subsidiaries that develop, manufacture, market and distribute specialty pharmaceutical products and therapies. Areas of focus include autoimmune and rare diseases in specialty areas like neurology, rheumatology, nephrology, pulmonology and ophthalmology; immunotherapy and neonatal respiratory critical care therapies; analgesics and gastrointestinal products.

We operate our business in two reportable segments, which are further described below:

•Specialty Brands includes innovative specialty pharmaceutical brands; and

•Specialty Generics includes niche specialty generic drugs and API(s).

For further information on our business and products, refer to Item 1. Business included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Significant Events

Voluntary Filing Under Chapter 11 and Going Concern

Chapter 11 Proceedings

On the Petition Date, we voluntarily initiated the Chapter 11 Cases under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court to modify our capital structure, including restructuring portions of our debt, and resolve otherwise unmanageable potential legal liabilities. We are continuing to operate our business as debtors-in-possession and supply customers and patients with products as normal.

To assure ordinary course operations, we received Bankruptcy Court approval of our customary motions filed on the Petition Date ("First Day Motions") on an interim basis seeking court authorization to continue to support our business operations during the Chapter 11 Cases, including the continued payment of employee wages and benefits without interruption, payment of critical and foreign vendors, continuation of customer programs, continuation of use of existing cash management programs and allowance of certain financing payments under a cash collateral order. The First Day Motions were subsequently approved by the Bankruptcy Court on a final basis at hearings.

We intend to use the Chapter 11 process to provide a fair, orderly, efficient and legally binding mechanism to implement a RSA pursuant to which, among other things, the parties thereto have agreed to support:

•a financial restructuring that would, among other things, reduce our total debt by approximately $1,300.0 million, improving our financial position and better positioning us for long-term growth;

•the Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement; and

•the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement.

Taken together, these actions are intended to enable us to move forward with our vision to become an innovation-driven biopharmaceutical company meeting the needs of underserved patients with severe and critical conditions. 

For further information on the Chapter 11 Cases, refer to Notes 2 and 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Reorganization items, net

Reorganization items, net, represent amounts incurred after the Petition Date as a direct result of the Chapter 11 Cases and are comprised of professional fees and adjustments to reflect the carrying value of liabilities subject to compromise at their estimated allowed claim amounts, as such adjustments are approved by the Bankruptcy Court. During fiscal 2020, reorganization items, net from the Petition Date through December 25, 2020 were $61.4 million.

55

Chapter 11 Financing

In accordance with the terms of the RSA, we obtained the entry in the Chapter 11 Cases of an order of the Bankruptcy Court (in a form agreed with, among others, the agent under the senior secured credit facilities, lenders under the senior secured revolving credit facility and the senior secured term loans and holders of the first lien senior notes and the second lien senior notes) permitting the use of cash collateral to finance the Chapter 11 Cases.

Such order requires that we make cash adequate protection payments on the senior secured revolving credit facility and the senior secured term loans for, among other things, unpaid pre-petition and post-petition fees, unpaid pre-petition interest (at the specified contract rate), and post-petition interest (at a rate equal to (1) the adjusted LIBOR, plus (2) the contract-specified applicable margin and plus (3) an incremental 200 basis points), quarterly amortization payments on the senior secured term loans and reimbursement of certain costs. Such order further requires that we make cash adequate protection payments on the first lien senior notes and the second lien senior notes for, among other things, unpaid pre-petition and post-petition interest (at the specified non-default interest rate) and reimbursement of certain costs.

With respect to the incremental 200 basis points paid on the senior secured revolving credit facility and the senior secured term loans, noted above, we incurred $11.7 million of expense, of which $7.8 million was paid, during the three months ended December 25, 2020, which has provisionally been classified as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. The cash collateral order, however reserves all parties rights to seek recharacterization or reallocation to principal of such payments and we expect the incremental expense affiliated with these debt instruments to be reclassified as a reduction in principal in connection with the confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. 

Going Concern

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The transactions contemplated by the RSA are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, among other conditions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the transactions described therein will be consummated. As a result, we have concluded that management’s plans at this stage do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Medicaid Lawsuit

In May 2019, CMS issued a final decision directing the Company to revert to the original base date AMP used to calculate Medicaid drug rebates for Acthar Gel despite CMS having given the previous owner of the product, Questcor, written authorization in 2012 to reset the base date AMP. Upon receipt of CMS’s final decision, we filed suit in D.C. District Court against HHS and CMS under the Administrative Procedure Act seeking to have the decision declared unlawful and set aside. In March 2020, we received an adverse decision from the D.C. District Court. We immediately sought reconsideration by the D.C. District Court, which was denied. We then appealed to the D.C. Circuit. In June 2020, while our appeal remained pending, we were required to revert to the original base date AMP for Acthar in the government’s price reporting system. 

During fiscal 2020, we incurred a retrospective one-time charge of $641.1 million related to the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate, of which $536.0 million and $105.1 million have been reflected as a component of net sales and operating expenses, respectively, in the consolidated statement of operations. The $105.1 million reflected as a component of operating expenses represents a pre-acquisition contingency related to the portion of the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate that arose from sales of Acthar Gel prior to our acquisition of Questcor in August 2014. Fiscal 2020 includes the prospective change to the Medicaid rebate calculation beginning in June 2020, which impacted Acthar Gel net sales by $40.4 million. 

The D.C. Circuit heard argument on the merits of our appeal in September 2020, prior to our filing of the Chapter 11 Cases on October 12, 2020. At the joint request of the parties, the D.C. Circuit has agreed to hold the case in abeyance pending completion of the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement discussed above, which was conditioned upon the Company entering the Chapter 11 restructuring process. Pursuant to the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement, we have agreed to pay $260.0 million over seven years and to reset Acthar Gel’s Medicaid rebate calculation as of July 1, 2020, such that state Medicaid programs will receive 100% rebates on Acthar Gel Medicaid sales, based on current Acthar Gel pricing. Additionally, upon execution of the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement, we will dismiss our D.C. Circuit appeal. We expect that the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement will be completed over the next several months, subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. 

This report contains certain financial measures, including net sales, gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales and R&D expenses as a percentage of net sales, which exclude the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit that is included as a component of net sales.

We have provided these measures because they are used by management to evaluate our operating performance. In addition, we believe that they will be used by certain investors to measure Mallinckrodt's operating results. Management believes that presenting these measures provides useful information about our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. These measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ("GAAP").

56

Because these measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease our reported results of operations, management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements and this report in its entirety. A reconciliation of certain of these financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures is included herein.

Opioid-Related Matters

As a result of the greater awareness of the public health issue of opioid abuse, there has been increased scrutiny of, and investigation into, the commercial practices of opioid manufacturers by state and federal agencies. We, along with other opioid manufacturers, have been the subject of federal and state government investigations and enforcement actions, focused on the misuse and abuse of opioid medications in the U.S. Similar investigations may be initiated in the future. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $55.7 million, $56.2 million and $38.8 million in opioid defense costs, respectively, which are included in SG&A expenses. As of the Petition Date, opioid defense costs directly related to the Chapter 11 proceedings are being classified on a go-forward basis as reorganization items, net. As a result, we expect a significant reduction in opioid defense costs classified within SG&A expenses during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings.

Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement

On February 25, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with a court-appointed plaintiffs' executive committee representing the interest of thousands of plaintiffs in the multi-district litigation ("MDL") and supported by a broad-based group of 48 state and U.S. Territory Attorneys General on the terms of a global settlement that would resolve all opioid-related claims against the Company and its subsidiaries (the "Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement"). The Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement contemplated the filing of voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 by the Specialty Generics Subsidiaries and the establishment of the Opioid Claimant Trust. Furthermore, under the terms of the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement, subject to court approval and other conditions, it was contemplated that, the Company would (i) make cash payments of $1,600.0 million in structured payments over eight years, beginning upon the Specialty Generics Subsidiaries’ emergence from the completed Chapter 11 case, the substantial majority of which would be expected to be contributed to the Opioid Claimant Trust and (ii) issue warrants with an eight year term to the Opioid Claimant Trust exercisable at a strike price of $3.15 per share to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares that would represent approximately 19.99% of the Company's fully diluted outstanding shares, including after giving effect to the exercise of the warrants (the “Settlement Warrants”). 

Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement

 In conjunction with our Chapter 11 filing on October 12, 2020, the Company entered into a RSA which includes the Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement that supersedes the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement. The RSA provides that upon the Company's emergence from Chapter 11 process, subject to court approval and other conditions:

•Opioid claims would be channeled to one or more trusts, which would receive $1,600.0 million in structured payments consisting of (i) a $450.0 million payment upon the Company's emergence from Chapter 11; (ii) a $200.0 million payment upon each of the first and second anniversaries of emergence; and (iii) a $150.0 million payment upon each of the third through seventh anniversaries of emergence with a one-year prepayment option at a discount for all but the first payment.

•Opioid claimants would also receive warrants for approximately 19.99% of the reorganized Company’s new outstanding shares, after giving effect to the exercise of the warrants, but subject to dilution from equity reserved under the management incentive plan, exercisable at any time on or prior to the seventh anniversary of the Company's emergence, at a strike price reflecting an aggregate equity value for the reorganized Debtors of $1,551.0 million (the "New Opioid Warrants").

•Upon commencing the Chapter 11 filing, the Company will comply with an agreed-upon operating injunction with respect to the operation of its opioid business.

During fiscal 2019, we recorded a charge of $1,643.4 million attributed to the anticipated structured cash payments and Settlement Warrants that were previously intended to be issued upon effectiveness of the superseded Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the equity value at emergence. As such, no value has been ascribed to the warrants as of December 25, 2020, resulting in a non-cash gain recorded of $43.4 million during fiscal 2020. For further information on the terms of this proposed resolution and valuation of the warrants as of December 25, 2020, refer to Notes 20 and 21, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Separation 

In fiscal 2016, the Board of Directors began to explore a range of strategic alternatives for our Specialty Generics business. Consistent with that strategy, in December 2018, we announced our plans to spin off to our shareholders a new independent public company that would hold the Specialty Generics business. In August 2019, based on market conditions and developments, including increasing uncertainties created by the opioid litigation, we announced the suspension of our previously announced plans to spin off 

57

the Specialty Generics business. On October 12, 2020, we voluntarily initiated Chapter 11 proceedings. Separating the Specialty Generics and Specialty Brands businesses remains one of our goals. We will continue to evaluate strategic options for the Specialty Generics business at an appropriate time and when market conditions are favorable.

During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $93.4 million, $63.9 million and $6.0 million in separation costs, respectively. These costs, which are included in SG&A expenses, primarily relate to professional fees, costs incurred in preparation for the Chapter 11 proceedings as we work to resolve opioid and other legal uncertainties, incremental costs incurred to build out the corporate infrastructure of the previously planned spin-off of the Specialty Generics business as well as rebranding initiatives associated with the Specialty Brands ongoing transformation. As of the Petition Date, professional fees directly related to the Chapter 11 proceedings that were previously reflected as separation costs are being classified on a go-forward basis as reorganization items, net. As a result, we expect a significant reduction in separation costs classified within SG&A expenses during the pendency of the Chapter 11 proceedings.

Tax Matters

In August 2020, a settlement was reached with the IRS related to the audit of Mallinckrodt Hospital Products Inc.’s ("MHP") (formerly known as Cadence Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Cadence")) tax year ended September 26, 2014. Cadence was acquired as a U.S. subsidiary in March 2014. Following the acquisition of Cadence, we transferred certain rights and risks in the Ofirmev intellectual property ("Transferred IP") to one of our wholly owned non-U.S. subsidiaries. The transfer occurred at a price determined in conjunction with external advisors, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations and with reference to the $1,329.0 million taxable consideration we paid to the shareholders of Cadence. The IRS asserted the transfer price of the Transferred IP was understated. The settlement increased the transfer price of the Transferred IP, resulting in an increase to taxable income of $356.5 million and underpayment interest of $11.8 million. The increase to taxable income was satisfied through a noncash offset against our U.S. Federal NOLs and interest expense for the tax year ended September 25, 2020, while the underpayment interest was satisfied through a cash payment of $11.8 million. We were adequately reserved for this item; therefore there were no impacts to the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal 2020.

On July 15, 2020, the activities of our principal executive offices were relocated from the U.K. to Ireland, which resulted in a change in our tax residence to Ireland. Mallinckrodt plc has always been and remains incorporated in Ireland. Relocation of Mallinckrodt plc’s tax residence to Ireland allows us to mitigate the potential impacts of the U.K.’s departure from the European Union and align with our commercial activity in Ireland. We continue to be subject to taxation in various tax jurisdictions worldwide. Accordingly, in fiscal 2020 we will report the Irish tax jurisdiction as our Domestic jurisdiction using an Irish statutory tax rate of 12.5% versus the U.K. statutory rate of 19.0%, and the International jurisdiction will represent areas outside the Irish tax jurisdiction. There is no material financial impact to this change.

Ofirmev

During the three months ended June 26, 2020, due to decreased demand as a result of the deprioritization of non-critical medical treatment in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with increased generic competition anticipated in the marketplace after the product's loss of exclusivity in December 2020, we identified a triggering event with respect to the Ofirmev intangible asset within the Specialty Brands segment and assessed the recoverability of the definite-lived asset. Additionally, we evaluated whether these events warranted a revision to the remaining period of amortization that previously extended to March 2022. As a result of this analysis, we revised the useful life to end December 25, 2020, commensurate with the final period of market exclusivity. After this change in estimate of the asset's useful life, we determined that the undiscounted cash flows related to the Ofirmev intangible asset were less than its net book value, which required us to record an impairment charge of $63.5 million for the difference between the fair value of the Ofirmev intangible asset and its net book value. The intangible asset was fully amortized as of December 25, 2020. We anticipate that the product sales for Ofirmev will decrease significantly from current levels following the loss of exclusivity and the entrance of generic competition. 

Terlipressin

During September 2020, the FDA issued a CRL regarding our NDA seeking approval for the investigational agent terlipressin to treat adults with HRS-1. The CRL stated that, based on the available data, the agency cannot approve the terlipressin NDA in its current form and requires more information to support a positive risk-benefit profile for terlipressin for patients with HRS-1. 

In response to receipt of the CRL, we had an End of Review Meeting on October 26, 2020 and a Type A Meeting on January 29, 2021 with the FDA where both parties engaged in constructive dialogue in an effort to clarify a viable path to approval and we expect to have clarity on this path in fiscal 2021. As we continue to engage with the FDA over the coming months, we will continue to assess the impact of any changes to planned revenue or earnings on the fair value of the associated IPR&D asset of $81.0 million included within intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 25, 2020 and December 27, 2019.

58

Amitiza

Prior to our acquisition of this product in February 2018, the prior owner had entered into an agreement with Par in connection with the settlement of patent litigation in the U.S. related to Amitiza. Under this agreement, Par was granted a non-exclusive license and right to market a competing generic version of lubiprostone 8 mcg and 24 mcg soft gelatin capsules in the U.S. for the indications approved for Amitiza beginning in fiscal 2021. While a competitive entrant has entered the market, we do not anticipate a material impact to Amitiza net sales in fiscal 2021 as Par will pay a double-digit royalty to us based on a percentage of the gross profits of the licensed products sold during the term of the agreement. The agreement continues until each of our related patents has expired; provided that the percentage of gross profits shall be reduced to zero if two or more generics or authorized generics are commercially marketing a generic product in addition to Par. 

Business Factors Influencing the Results of Operations 

COVID-19 Business Update 

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world. As we navigate the unprecedented challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, we remain committed to supporting our employees, customers, patients and the broader communities in which we operate. 

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to manufacture, supply and deliver our products largely without interruption. At present, we do not anticipate significant COVID-19-related manufacturing or supply chain disruptions, and we continue to evaluate our end-to-end supply chain and assess opportunities to refine our processes going forward.

We are supporting the fight against COVID-19 in a number of ways, including by partnering with Novoteris, LLC and Massachusetts General Hospital to study inhaled nitric oxide for use as a therapeutic option for COVID-19 patients; giving medically trained employees paid time off to volunteer to treat or care for COVID-19 patients; providing funding and therapies to hospitals to conduct treatment-related research; adapting certain of our manufacturing facilities to produce hand sanitizers for designated counties, state health departments and emergency operation distribution centers located in states where we have operations; donating excess PPE and other resources to healthcare providers, first responders, and medical facilities; and partnering with advocacy groups to help mitigate the impact of the pandemic on patients.

We expect the coming months to continue to be challenging due to the impact of COVID-19, as some of our products are sensitive to reduced numbers of surgical procedures and doctor visits. Our business performance was significantly impacted by COVID-19 during fiscal 2020. The ultimate business impact going forward will largely be determined by the ongoing return to work guidance issued by international, national, and local governments and health officials and organizations. We are monitoring the demand for our products, including the duration and degree to which we may see declines in customer orders or delays in starting new patients on a product, such as Acthar Gel, due to the limited ability of our sales representatives to meet with physicians and patients to visit their doctors and pharmacists to receive prescriptions for certain of our products. In regards to Acthar Gel, we continue to see a reduction in new patients, which may impact results in fiscal 2021. We also experienced and may continue to experience reduced demand for Therakos due to immunosuppressed patients who have been instructed to stay-at-home during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, while we are supporting the continuation of ongoing patients in our clinical trials, as much as possible, we expect that COVID-19 precautions may directly or indirectly impact the timeline for some of our clinical trials. 

Given the rapid and evolving nature of the COVID-19 virus, the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. For additional information on the various risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, refer to Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors included within this report.

59

Specialty Brands

Net sales of Acthar Gel for fiscal 2020 decreased $184.8 million, or 19.4%, to $767.9 million driven primarily by the marketplace impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending. The prospective change to the Medicaid rebate calculation also served to reduce Acthar Gel net sales by $40.4 million during fiscal 2020. In addition, net sales of Ofirmev decreased $107.5 million or 28.0%, to $276.5 million primarily driven by the overall reduction in elective surgeries due to public health orders implemented as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the product's loss of exclusivity in December 2020.

Research and Development

We devote significant resources to R&D of products and proprietary drug technologies. During fiscal 2020, we incurred R&D expenses of $290.8 million. We expect to continue to pursue targeted investments in R&D activities, both for existing products and the development of new portfolio assets. We intend to focus our R&D investments in the specialty pharmaceuticals areas, specifically investments to support our Specialty Brands business, where we believe there is the greatest opportunity for growth and profitability.

We have completed the Phase 3 clinical studies for two of our development programs, terlipressin for the treatment of HRS-1 and StrataGraft for the treatment of deep partial-thickness burns, both of which had positive top line results. 

•Terlipressin. In March 2020, we submitted the NDA filing to the FDA for terlipressin and in April 2020 the FDA accepted the NDA for review. In June 2020, the Company paid $5.0 million to acquire product rights for terlipressin in Japan. Upon FDA approval, we would be responsible for a one-time milestone payment related to terlipressin of $12.5 million in relation to product rights in the U.S., in addition to a $5.0 million one-time milestone payment in relation to product rights in Japan. For further information on the development of this asset and receipt of the CRL during September 2020, refer to "Significant Events" within this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

•StrataGraft. In April 2020, we initiated a rolling submission of a BLA filing to the FDA for StrataGraft, a regenerative skin tissue therapy for the treatment of adult patients with deep partial-thickness thermal burns, and we completed the submission in June 2020. In July 2020, the FDA accepted our submission which triggered a $20.0 million payment to the prior shareholders of Stratatech. We are responsible for another $20.0 million payment upon approval by the FDA. The FDA accepted the BLA for review in August 2020, and granted the application priority review and assigned a PDUFA target date in early 2021. Subsequently, the FDA deferred action on the BLA due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions, which are delaying a required manufacturing site inspection. We plan to work closely with the FDA to complete the review and schedule the site inspection.

Specialty Generics

Net sales from the Specialty Generics segment were $689.8 million for fiscal 2020 compared to $738.7 million for fiscal 2019. This decrease in net sales was driven primarily by a change in product mix due to market shifts as a result of COVID-19.

Net Sales

Net sales by geographic area are as follows (dollars in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

60

Net sales in fiscal 2020 decreased $949.1 million, or 30.0%, to $2,213.4 million, compared with $3,162.5 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the retrospective one-time charge of $536.0 million reflected as a component of net sales related to the Medicaid lawsuit.

Net sales (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit) in fiscal 2020 decreased $413.1 million, or 13.1%, to $2,749.4 million, compared with $3,162.5 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in our Specialty Brands segment including a significant decrease in net sales of Acthar Gel and Ofirmev, as previously discussed. In addition, Other Specialty Brands products included an additional $40.1 million of net sales in fiscal 2019 related to BioVectra, Inc. ("BioVectra") prior to the completion of the sale of this business in November 2019. For further information on changes in our net sales, refer to "Business Segment Results" within this Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Operating Loss 

Gross profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2020 decreased $752.0 million, or 52.9%, to $669.4 million, compared with $1,421.4 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by the retrospective one-time charge of $536.0 million reflected as a component of net sales related to the Medicaid lawsuit.

Gross profit (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit) in fiscal 2020 decreased $216.0 million, or 15.2%, to $1,205.4 million, compared with $1,421.4 million in fiscal 2019. Gross profit margin was 43.8% for fiscal 2020, compared with 44.9% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to the $413.1 million decrease in net sales, as discussed above, as well as the change in product mix driven by the decrease in Acthar Gel net sales. This decrease was partially offset by decreases in amortization in fiscal 2020 as compared to fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2019 had additional amortization related to the Ofirmev intangible asset resulting from a change in amortization method on day 1 of fiscal 2019, and amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment related to Amitiza, which was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2019.

Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2020 were $884.1 million, compared with $831.0 million for fiscal 2019, an increase of $53.1 million, or 6.4%. This increase is attributable to a $9.9 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities in fiscal 2020, compared to a $60.2 million decrease in fiscal 2019, a $29.4 million increase in separation costs, as well as an increase in employee compensation and benefits driven by certain changes made to the design of our long-term incentive compensation program in an effort to manage share usage and dilution and the approval of a key employee incentive program during fiscal 2020, both of which reflect the shorter-term nature of our new target opportunities. These increases were partially offset by decreases in legal expenses driven by a $28.2 million charge associated with the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases during fiscal 2019, decreased professional fees, and a decrease in travel expense due to temporary travel restrictions as a result of COVID-19. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses were 39.9% for fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit, as previously discussed above), SG&A expenses were 32.2% and 26.3% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Research and development expenses. R&D expenses decreased $58.6 million, or 16.8%, to $290.8 million in fiscal 2020, compared with $349.4 million in fiscal 2019. This decrease was driven by the completion of certain development programs as well as a $20.0 million upfront payment made to Silence during fiscal 2019. The Company continues to focus current R&D activities on performing clinical studies and publishing clinical and non-clinical experiences and evidence that support health economic activities and patient outcomes. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses were 13.1% for fiscal 2020. As a percentage of net sales, (excluding the one-time charge related to the Medicaid lawsuit, as previously discussed above), R&D expenses were 10.6% and 11.0% in fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Restructuring and related charges, net. During fiscal 2020, we recognized $49.8 million of restructuring and related charges, net, of which $12.3 million related to accelerated depreciation and was included in SG&A. The accelerated depreciation and remaining $37.5 million primarily related to the exiting of our Bedminster, New Jersey facility as we move our Specialty Brands commercial headquarters from Bedminster to Hampton, New Jersey, as well as employee severance and benefits. During fiscal 2019, we recognized a benefit of $1.7 million, of restructuring and related charges, net, primarily related to the settlement of the contract termination costs related to the production of Raplixa resulting in a $14.1 million reversal of the associated restructuring reserve that was previously established in fiscal 2018. This was partially offset by restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefits. 

Non-restructuring impairment charges. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $63.5 million for fiscal 2020 resulting from the partial impairment related to our Ofirmev product intangible asset, as previously discussed. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $388.0 million for fiscal 2019 primarily related to a $274.5 million full impairment related to our VTS-270 intangible asset and a $113.5 million full impairment related to our stannsoporfin intangible asset.

(Gains) losses on divestiture. During fiscal 2020 we recorded gains on divestiture of $16.6 million, related to the achievement of milestones affiliated with the sale of a portion of our Hemostasis business in fiscal 2018 to Baxter International, Inc. ("Baxter"). During fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of BioVectra for a loss of $33.5 million.

Opioid-related litigation settlement (gain) loss. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a gain of $43.4 million due to the decrease in the fair value of the New Opioid Warrants, which were determined to have no value as of December 25, 2020 given we cannot reasonably 

61

estimate the equity value at emergence. During fiscal 2019, we recorded a charge of $1,643.4 million attributed to the anticipated structured cash payments and the Settlement Warrants that were to be issued upon effectiveness of the superseded Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement.

Medicaid lawsuit. During fiscal 2020, we incurred a retrospective one-time charge of $105.1 million, which represents a pre-acquisition contingency related to the portion of the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate that arose from sales of Acthar Gel prior to our acquisition of Questcor in August 2014.

Non-Operating Items 

Interest expense and interest income. During fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, net interest expense was $255.2 million and $299.5 million, respectively. This $44.3 million decrease was attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2020, partially offset by $11.7 million of expense related to adequate protection payments which have provisionally been classified as interest expense. This yielded a decrease in interest expense of $39.2 million. Additionally, fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 included the recognition of a $19.2 million and $8.6 million benefit to interest expense, respectively, due to a lapse of certain statute of limitations. For further information, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interest income decreased to $5.9 million during fiscal 2020, compared to $9.5 million during fiscal 2019, primarily driven by lower interest rates during fiscal 2020, partially offset by interest earned on our preferred equity certificates that were received as contingent consideration related to the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business.

Gains on debt extinguishment, net. During fiscal 2019, we recorded gains on debt extinguishment, net, of $466.6 million, primarily related to a private exchange of our senior unsecured notes resulting in a gain of $377.4 million, net of the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $4.9 million. For further information, refer to Note 15 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Fiscal 2019 also included a gain of $98.6 million on debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $492.1 million, partially offset by the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $9.4 million. 

Other income, net. During fiscal 2020 and 2019, we recorded other income, net, of $7.4 million and $63.6 million, respectively. This decrease was primarily driven by a $39.0 million decrease in royalty income, as well as a $16.4 million decrease in the unrealized gain on investment related to our equity investment in Silence. The remaining income in both periods represented non-service pension expense and other items, including gains and losses on intercompany financing, foreign currency transactions and related hedging instruments.

Reorganization items, net. During fiscal 2020, we recorded $61.4 million of reorganization items, net in conjunction with our Chapter 11 proceedings. These charges included $51.1 million of advisor and legal fees directly related to the Chapter 11 Cases and $10.2 million of deferred financing fee write-offs related to the unsecured notes in order to reflect the carrying value of the unsecured notes within liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2020 at their estimated allowed claim amounts. 

Expense (benefit) from income taxes. During fiscal 2020, we recognized an income tax expense of $8.9 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $960.8 million. The fiscal 2020 income tax expense was comprised of $375.3 million of current tax benefit and $384.2 million of deferred tax expense. The current tax benefit was primarily the result of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act and unrecognized tax benefits, partially offset by the fiscal 2020 reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership. The deferred tax expense was predominantly related to the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets, and the fiscal 2020 reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership. During fiscal 2019, we recognized an income tax benefit of $584.3 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $1,591.5 million. The fiscal 2019 income tax benefit was comprised of $21.8 million of current tax expense and $606.1 million of deferred tax benefit, which was predominantly related to previously acquired intangibles, the opioid-related litigation settlement charge, the generation of tax loss and credit carryforwards net of valuation allowances, the non-restructuring impairment charge, as well as the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership, which eliminated the interest-bearing deferred tax obligation.

Our effective tax rate was negative 0.9% and 36.7% for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was most significantly impacted by the recognition of a $618.2 million tax expense associated with valuation allowances and an $82.0 million tax expense associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated asset and legal entity ownership, offset with a $281.5 million tax benefit associated with the CARES Act and $11.9 million of tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions. Additional impacts to the effective tax rate include receiving $11.8 million of tax benefit associated with $93.4 million of separation costs, $5.4 million of tax benefit associated with $61.4 million of reorganization items, $0.5 million of tax benefit associated with $25.3 million of share-based compensation, and no tax expense associated with $43.4 million of gain due to the decrease in the fair value of the New Opioid Warrants. All of these additional impacts are offset with the above referenced valuation allowance thus resulting in no net impact on tax expense or benefit. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was most significantly impacted by the recognition of $212.8 million tax benefit associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership. Further impacts include receiving $211.9 million of tax benefit 

62

associated with the $1,643.4 million opioid-related litigation settlement charge, $71.9 million of tax benefit associated with $386.3 million of restructuring costs and non-restructuring impairment charges, $18.7 million of tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions, $13.5 million of tax benefit primarily associated with U.S. tax credits, $11.4 million of tax benefit associated with separation costs of $63.9 million, $10.2 million of tax expense associated with a gain on debt extinguishment of $466.6 million, $8.0 million of tax benefit associated with a legal settlement charge of $28.2 million, $7.6 million of tax expense associated with the $60.2 million of income from the decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and zero tax impact associated with a $33.5 million loss associated with the sale of BioVectra. Any remaining impacts were related to the impact of recent acquisitions.

Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. We recorded income of $25.1 million and $10.7 million on discontinued operations, net of income taxes, during fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. Fiscal 2020 included the recognition of a tax benefit related to a release of tax and interest on unrecognized tax benefits due to a lapse of certain statute of limitations related to the Nuclear Imaging business. The remaining income during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 primarily related to the receipt of contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business, partially offset by various post-sale adjustments associated with our previous divestitures.

Fiscal Year Ended December 27, 2019 Compared with Fiscal Year Ended December 28, 2018 

Net Sales

Net sales by geographic area are as follows (dollars in millions): 

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Net sales in fiscal 2019 decreased $53.1 million, or 1.7%, to $3,162.5 million, compared with $3,215.6 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease was driven by our Specialty Brands segment primarily due to Acthar Gel, as the brand continued to face reimbursement challenges impacting new and returning patients while navigating continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending. In addition, we experienced lower net sales in Other branded products primarily due to the sale of Recothrom during the first quarter of 2018, as well as a decrease in net sales from BioVectra largely driven by the sale of this business in November 2019. These decreases were partially offset by continued strength in Ofirmev, INOmax and Therakos and the increase in net sales related to Amitiza, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2018. In addition, we continued to experience increased net sales in the Specialty Generics segment due to share recapture in specialty generic products, partially offset by opioid market contraction. For further information on changes in our net sales, refer to "Business Segment Results" within this Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Operating Loss 

Gross profit. Gross profit for fiscal 2019 decreased $49.8 million, or 3.4%, to $1,421.4 million, compared with $1,471.2 million in fiscal 2018, due in part to the $53.1 million decrease in net sales, as discussed above. Gross profit margin was 44.9% for fiscal 2019, compared with 45.8% in fiscal 2018. The decrease in gross profit and gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a change in product mix driven by the decrease in Acthar Gel net sales and an additional $107.3 million of amortization for the Ofirmev intangible asset resulting from a change in amortization method on day 1 of fiscal 2019. The additional amortization was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment related to Amitiza, which was fully amortized during the first quarter of 2019.

Selling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A expenses for fiscal 2019 were $831.0 million, compared with $834.1 million for fiscal 2018, a decrease of $3.1 million, or 0.4%. This decrease is attributable to cost benefits gained from restructuring actions, including lower employee compensation costs and a $60.2 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities in fiscal 2019, compared to a $50.2 million decrease in fiscal 2018. These decreases were partially offset by a $57.9 million increase in separation costs, an increase in legal expense, primarily related to opioid defense costs, and an increase in legal settlements driven by the $28.2 million charge associated with the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases during fiscal 2019. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses were 26.3% and 25.9% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. 

Research and development expenses. R&D expenses decreased $11.7 million, or 3.2%, to $349.4 million in fiscal 2019, compared with $361.1 million in fiscal 2018. This decrease was driven by the completion of certain development programs, partially offset by 

63

the $20.0 million upfront payment made to Silence during fiscal 2019. R&D activities focused on performing clinical studies and publishing clinical and non-clinical experiences and generating evidence that support health economic activities and patient outcomes. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses were 11.0% and 11.2% in fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Restructuring and related charges, net. During fiscal 2019, we recognized a net benefit of $1.7 million of restructuring and related charges, net. During fiscal 2019, we finalized the settlement of the contract termination costs related to the production of Raplixa resulting in a $14.1 million reversal of the associated restructuring reserve that was previously established in fiscal 2018. This was partially offset by restructuring charges related to employee severance and benefits. During fiscal 2018, we recorded $108.2 million of restructuring and related charges, net, of which $5.2 million related to accelerated depreciation and was included in cost of sales. The remaining $103.0 million primarily related to the estimated contract termination costs associated with the production of Raplixa, exiting certain facilities and employee severance and benefits.

 Non-restructuring impairment charges. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $388.0 million for fiscal 2019 resulting from the $274.5 million full impairment related to our VTS-270 intangible asset and the $113.5 million full impairment related to our stannsoporfin intangible asset. Non-restructuring impairment charges were $3,893.1 million for fiscal 2018 primarily related to the $3,672.8 million full goodwill impairment and the $218.3 million full impairment related to our MNK-1411 intangible asset. 

Losses on divestiture. During fiscal 2019, we completed the sale of BioVectra for a loss of $33.5 million. During fiscal 2018, we sold a portion of our Hemostasis business, inclusive of our PreveLeak and Recothrom products. As a result of this sale, we recorded a loss of $0.8 million.

Opioid-related litigation settlement (gain) loss. During fiscal 2019, we recorded a charge of $1,643.4 million attributed to the anticipated structured cash payments and the Settlement Warrants that were to be issued upon effectiveness of the superseded Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement.

Non-Operating Items 

Interest expense and interest income. During fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, net interest expense was $299.5 million and $362.0 million, respectively. This $62.5 million decrease was attributable to a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal 2019 that yielded a decrease in interest expense of $26.6 million, a $23.7 million decrease in interest accrued on deferred tax liabilities associated with our previously outstanding installment notes and the recognition of an $8.6 million benefit to interest expense during fiscal 2019 due to a lapse of certain statute of limitations. Additionally, non-cash interest expense decreased by $2.4 million over the comparable period. Interest income increased to $9.5 million during fiscal 2019, compared to $8.2 million during fiscal 2018, primarily related to interest on preferred equity certificates received as contingent consideration associated with the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business.

Gains on debt extinguishment, net. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded gains on debt extinguishment, net, of $466.6 million and $8.5 million, respectively. During fiscal 2019 we completed a private exchange of our senior unsecured notes resulting in a gain of $377.4 million, net of the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $4.9 million. Fiscal 2019 also included a gain of $98.6 million on debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $492.1 million, partially offset by the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $9.4 million. Fiscal 2018 included a gain of $12.7 million on debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $81.8 million, partially offset by the write-off of associated deferred financing fees of $4.2 million.

Other income, net. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded other income, net, of $63.6 million and $22.4 million, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by a $23.5 million increase in royalty income. In addition, we recorded an unrealized gain on investment of $20.2 million related to our equity investment in Silence. The remaining amounts in both fiscal years represented non-service pension expense and other items, including gains and losses on intercompany financing, foreign currency transactions and related hedging instruments.

Expense (benefit) from income taxes. During fiscal 2019, we recognized an income tax benefit of $584.3 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $1,591.5 million. The fiscal 2019 income tax benefit was comprised of $21.8 million of current tax expense and $606.1 million of deferred tax benefit, which was predominantly related to previously acquired intangibles, the opioid-related litigation settlement charge, the generation of tax loss and credit carryforwards net of valuation allowances, the non-restructuring impairment charge, as well as the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership, which eliminated the interest-bearing deferred tax obligation. During fiscal 2018, we recognized an income tax benefit of $430.1 million on a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of $4,052.0 million. The fiscal 2018 income tax benefit was comprised of $112.8 million of current tax expense and $542.9 million of deferred tax benefit, which was predominantly related to the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership and generation of net operating losses.

Our effective tax rate was 36.7% and 10.6% for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was most significantly impacted by the recognition of $212.8 million tax benefit associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership. Further impacts include receiving $211.9 million of tax benefit associated with the $1,643.4 million opioid-related litigation settlement charge, $71.9 million of tax benefit associated with the $386.3 million restructuring costs and non-restructuring impairment charges, $18.7 million of tax benefit associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions, $13.5 million of tax benefit primarily associated with U.S. tax credits, $11.4 million of tax 

64

benefit associated with separation costs of $63.9 million, $10.2 million of tax expense associated with a gain on debt extinguishment of $466.6 million, $8.0 million of tax benefit associated with a legal settlement charge of $28.2 million, $7.6 million of tax expense associated with $60.2 million of income from the decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities and zero tax impact associated with a $33.5 million loss associated with the sale of BioVectra. Any remaining impacts were related to the impact of recent acquisitions. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was most significantly impacted by the recognition of $256.0 million tax benefit associated with the reorganization of our intercompany financing and associated legal entity ownership; partially offset by a decrease to tax benefit of $73.2 million associated with accrued income tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions. Further impacts include receiving $60.9 million of tax benefit associated with the $4,001.3 million of restructuring costs and non-restructuring impairment charges, $25.9 million of tax benefit primarily associated with U.S. tax credits, $2.7 million of tax benefit associated with a $0.8 million loss associated with the sale of our PreveLeak and Recothrom assets and $2.2 million of tax expense associated with $50.2 million of income from the decrease in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities. Any remaining impacts were related to the impact of recent acquisitions and the reduction in the U.S. federal corporate statutory rate from U.S. Tax Reform.

Income from discontinued operations, net of income taxes. We recorded income of $10.7 million and $14.9 million on discontinued operations, net of income taxes, during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. During fiscal 2019 and 2018, the income from discontinued operations included $9.0 million and $13.6 million of income, net of tax, respectively, from the receipt of contingent consideration related to the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business. The remaining amounts in both periods represented various post-sale adjustments associated with our previous divestitures.

Business Segment Results 

Management measures and evaluates our operating segments based on segment net sales and operating income. Management excludes corporate expenses from segment operating income. In addition, certain amounts that management considers to be non-recurring or non-operational are excluded from segment net sales and operating income because management and the chief operating decision maker evaluate the operating results of the segments excluding such items. These items include, but are not limited to, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation, net restructuring charges, non-restructuring impairment charges, separation costs, R&D upfront payments, changes related to the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement and the Acthar Gel Medicaid Retrospective Rebate incurred as a result of the Medicaid lawsuit. During fiscal 2020, management began excluding depreciation and share-based compensation from its evaluation of the operating results of its segments. As a result, prior period segment operating income has been recast to reflect this change on a comparable basis. Although these amounts are excluded from segment net sales and segment operating income, as applicable, they are included in reported consolidated net sales and operating (loss) income and in the reconciliations presented below. Selected information by business segment is as follows:

*Not meaningful

Specialty Brands. Net sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $364.2 million, or 15.0%, to $2,059.6 million, compared with $2,423.8 million for fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by a $184.8 million, or 19.4%, decrease in Acthar Gel net sales driven primarily by the marketplace impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending. The prospective change to the Medicaid rebate calculation also served to reduce Acthar Gel net sales by $40.4 million during fiscal 2020. The decrease was also driven by a $107.5 million, or 28.0%, decrease in Ofirmev net sales primarily due to overall reduction in elective surgeries due to public health orders implemented as part of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the product's loss of exclusivity in December 2020. In addition, Other Specialty Brands product sales included an additional $40.1 million of net sales in fiscal 2019 related to BioVectra, which was sold in November 2019, and net sales for Amitiza decreased $19.7 million, or 9.4% due to decreased volumes driven by increased competition. The remaining decrease relates to Therakos net sales due to stay-at-home directives issued as part of COVID-19 public health orders.

Specialty Generics. Net sales for fiscal 2020 decreased $48.9 million, or 6.6%, to $689.8 million, compared to $738.7 million for fiscal 2019. The decrease in net sales was driven by decreased net sales of $62.6 million, or 17.8%, and $24.6 million, or 54.5%, for Other controlled substance and Other products, respectively. These decreases were partially offset by a $23.1 million, or 12.2%, increase in acetaminophen net sales, and a $21.7 million, or 28.4%, increase in hydrocodone-related products net sales.

Operating Loss

Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2020 and 2019 is shown in the following table (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes $10.0 million of inventory fair-value step up expense related to Amitiza during fiscal 2019.

(2)Includes administration expenses and certain compensation, legal, environmental and other costs not charged to our reportable segments.

(3)Represents R&D expense incurred related to an upfront payment made to acquire product rights in Japan for terlipressin in fiscal 2020 and an upfront payment made to Silence in connection with the license and collaboration agreement entered into in fiscal 2019.

Specialty Brands. Operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased $194.4 million to $1,015.7 million, compared with $1,210.1 million for fiscal 2019. Operating margin decreased to 49.3% for fiscal 2020, compared with 49.9% for fiscal 2019. The decrease in operating income is primarily driven by the $364.2 million, or 15.0%, decrease in net sales over the same period, which resulted in a $278.9 million decrease in gross profit. This was partially offset by a $47.9 million or 9.1% decrease in SG&A expenses primarily driven by lower travel costs due to temporary travel restrictions for COVID-19, lower consulting and professional fees, and a $36.5 million or 13.2% decrease in R&D expenses.

Specialty Generics. Operating income for fiscal 2020 increased $37.9 million to $206.4 million, compared with $168.5 million for fiscal 2019. Operating margin increased to 29.9% for fiscal 2020, compared with 22.8% for fiscal 2019. As a result of the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement announced during the three months ended March 27, 2020, the corresponding opioid defense costs are considered to be non-recurring; therefore, such costs are excluded from segment operating income and presented as a corporate and unallocated expense on a go-forward basis. In comparison, there were $56.2 million of opioid defense costs reflected in operating income during fiscal 2019. This was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit primarily driven by the decrease in net sales.

Corporate and unallocated expenses. Corporate and unallocated expenses were $166.1 million and $102.3 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. This increase is attributable to a $9.9 million increase in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities in fiscal 2020, compared to a $60.2 million decrease in fiscal 2019, as well as opioid defense costs of $55.7 million being presented as a corporate and unallocated expense beginning during the three months ended March 27, 2020, as a result of the Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement, as previously discussed. The remaining increase is primarily related to employee compensation and benefits driven by certain changes made to the design of our long-term incentive compensation program in an effort to manage share usage and dilution and the approval of a key employee incentive program during fiscal 2020. This is partially offset by gains on divestiture in fiscal 2020 of $16.6 million primarily related to the achievement of milestones related to the sale of a portion of our Hemostasis business in fiscal 2018 to Baxter, compared with a $33.5 million loss on the divestiture of BioVectra during fiscal 2019, and lower consulting and professional fees. In addition, fiscal 2019 included a $28.2 million charge associated with the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases.

Specialty Brands. Net sales for fiscal 2019 decreased $72.9 million, or 2.9%, to $2,423.8 million, compared with $2,496.7 million for fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by a $157.4 million, or 14.2%, decrease in Acthar Gel net sales driven primarily by continued reimbursement challenges impacting new and returning patients and continued payer scrutiny on overall specialty pharmaceutical spending, a $13.7 million, or 40.4%, decrease in Other product sales primarily attributable to the sale of Recothrom during the first quarter of 2018 and a $13.0 million, or 24.5%, decrease in net sales related to BioVectra, which was sold in November 2019. These decreases were partially offset by continued strength in Ofirmev, INOmax, and Therakos, as well as an increase in net sales related to Amitiza, which was acquired in the first quarter of 2018.

Specialty Generics. Net sales for fiscal 2019 increased $19.8 million, or 2.8%, to $738.7 million, compared to $718.9 million for fiscal 2018. The increase in net sales was driven by increased net sales of $10.4 million, or 15.8%, and $8.8 million, or 13.3%, for hydrocodone-related products and oxycodone-related products, respectively, along with an increase of $8.7 million, or 2.5%, related to net sales of other controlled substances. These increases were partially offset by decreased net sales of $5.3 million, or 10.5%, related to other product net sales primarily due to decreases from our supply agreement with the acquirer of our contrast media and delivery systems business.

Operating Loss

Operating income by segment and as a percentage of segment net sales for fiscal 2019 and 2018 is shown in the following table (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes $10.0 million and $118.8 million of inventory fair-value step up expense, primarily related to Amitiza during fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(2)Represents R&D expense incurred related to an upfront payment made to Silence in connection with the license and collaboration agreement entered into in July 2019.

Specialty Brands. Operating income for fiscal 2019 increased $74.0 million to $1,210.1 million, compared with $1,136.1 million for fiscal 2018. Operating margin increased to 49.9% for fiscal 2019, compared with 45.5% for fiscal 2018. The increase in operating income and margin includes a $31.0 million increase in gross profit primarily driven by an additional $110.8 million of expense recorded during fiscal 2018 related to the inventory fair value adjustment for Amitiza, which was fully amortized in the first quarter of 2019. The increase in operating income and margin was also attributable to a $20.7 million decrease in R&D spending and a $22.8 million decrease in SG&A expenses compared to fiscal 2018, primarily due to cost benefits gained from restructuring actions, including lower employee compensation costs. These changes were partially offset by changes in product mix, primarily driven by the decrease in Acthar Gel net sales.

Specialty Generics. Operating income for fiscal 2019 increased $15.0 million to $168.5 million, compared with $153.5 million for fiscal 2018. Operating margin increased to 22.8% for fiscal 2019, compared with 21.4% for fiscal 2018. The increase in operating 

69

income and margin was impacted by a $21.6 million increase in gross profit primarily due to product mix as well as a $9.8 million decrease in R&D spending, partially offset by a $16.5 million increase in SG&A primarily due to higher legal expense related to opioid litigation defense costs and increased consulting and professional fees. 

Corporate and unallocated expenses. Corporate and unallocated expenses were $102.3 million and $121.7 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Fiscal 2019 included a $33.5 million loss on the divestiture of BioVectra and a $28.2 million charge associated with the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases, partially offset by a $60.2 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities. Fiscal 2018 included a $50.2 million decrease in the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities, as well as an $11.8 million reduction in the accrual associated with our Lower Passaic River, New Jersey environmental remediation liability. The remaining decrease was primarily driven by cost benefits gained from restructuring actions, including lower employee compensation costs, partially offset by increased professional fees.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Significant factors driving our liquidity position include cash flows generated from operating activities, financing transactions, capital expenditures, cash paid in connection with acquisitions and licensing agreements and cash received as a result of our divestitures. We have historically generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flows from operations. Our ability to fund our capital needs is impacted by our ongoing ability to generate cash from operations and access to capital markets.

 On October 12, 2020, Mallinckrodt plc and certain of its subsidiaries voluntarily initiated the Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court, to modify its capital structure, including restructuring portions of its debt, and resolve potential legal liabilities, including but not limited to those in connection with the Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement and the Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement. We intend to use the Chapter 11 process to provide a fair, orderly, efficient and legally binding mechanism to implement a RSA, entered into in connection with the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases, that provides for a financial restructuring designed to strengthen our balance sheet and reduce our total debt by approximately $1,300.0 million, improving our financial position and allowing us to continue driving our strategic priorities and investing in the business to develop and commercialize therapies to improve health outcomes. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern. The transactions contemplated by the RSA are subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court, among other conditions. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that the transactions described therein will be consummated. As a result, we have concluded that management’s plans at this stage do not alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Consequently, our future cash from operations and access to capital markets may not provide adequate resources to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures and strategic investments for the foreseeable future.

In general, we intend to fund capital expenditures with cash generated from operations. As of December 25, 2020, we had no capital expenditure commitments.

Under our credit agreement, we are required to prepay our term loans in an amount equal to a specified percentage of excess cash flow. We have sought Bankruptcy Court approval to make such mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to approximately $114.0 million with respect to fiscal 2020.

A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities is provided in the following table (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities of $498.9 million for fiscal 2020 included a loss of $944.6 million, adjusted for non-cash items of $1,331.2 million driven by depreciation and amortization of $885.2 million, a $385.3 million reduction in our deferred income tax assets, and a $63.5 million non-cash impairment charge related to the Ofirmev product intangible asset. The net loss was also offset by cash provided from net investment in working capital of $112.3 million, primarily driven by the $638.9 million Medicaid lawsuit liability. Also included within this change in working capital was a $37.9 million decrease in accounts receivable, 

70

and a $15.7 million increase in accounts payable, net of transfers to liabilities subject to compromise. These items were offset by a $433.8 million increase in net receivables related to income taxes that was driven by tax benefits from the CARES Act and changes in uncertain tax positions, a $95.3 million net cash outflow related to other assets and liabilities primarily driven by decreases in accrued payroll and accrued restructuring, net of transfers to liabilities subject to compromise, and a $51.1 million increase in inventory.

Net cash provided by operating activities of $742.9 million for fiscal 2019 included a loss from continuing operations, as adjusted for non-cash items including a $466.6 million gain on debt extinguishment, net and a $388.0 million adjustment for non-cash impairment charges. The loss from continuing operations adjusted for non-cash items was offset by a $1,451.6 million inflow from net changes in working capital, primarily driven by the portion of the opioid-related litigation settlement liability related to the structured cash payments of $1,600.0 million with the remaining $43.4 million related to the Settlement Warrants reflected as a non-cash item. This was partially offset by a $161.5 million net outflow from other assets and liabilities primarily driven by cash outflows related to separation costs, one time legal settlement payments of $24.0 million and $15.4 million related to the settlement of the MDL Track 1 Cases and the Questcor DOJ settlement, respectively, a $26.5 million decrease in accrued restructuring charges, a $16.3 million decrease in payroll related accruals and decreases in other accrual balances attributable to cost benefits gained from restructuring actions. 

Net cash provided by operating activities of $665.5 million for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to income from continuing operations, as adjusted for non-cash items including a $3,893.1 million adjustment for non-cash impairment charges, as previously discussed, and a $46.4 million inflow from net investment in working capital. The working capital inflow was primarily attributable to a $99.0 million cash inflow from net tax related balances, a $63.1 million decrease in inventory balances, a $24.6 million increase in accounts payable, net, and a $5.5 million net inflow related to other assets and liabilities, offset by a $145.8 million increase in accounts receivable, net.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities of $11.2 million for fiscal 2020 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $47.7 million, partially offset by cash proceeds of $29.8 million for the redemption of 100% of the outstanding preferred equity certificates received as part of contingent earn-out payments related to the sale of the Nuclear Imaging business, as previously discussed. The remaining activity primarily relates to post-sale adjustments from various divestitures.

Net cash used in investing activities of $8.3 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $133.0 million, partially offset by $95.1 million in proceeds received related to the sale of BioVectra, net of cash, as well as proceeds from other long-term asset disposals.

 Net cash used in investing activities of $480.3 million for fiscal 2018 was primarily attributable to cash outflows related to the acquisition of Sucampo Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Sucampo") in fiscal 2018 of $698.0 million and capital expenditures of $127.0 million. These outflows were partially offset by the $159.0 million of proceeds received, net of transaction costs, from the divestiture of a portion of the Hemostasis business, inclusive of the PreveLeak and Recothrom products; proceeds received of $154.0 million related to the note receivable from the purchaser of the Intrathecal Therapy business that was sold during fiscal 2017; and a $25.5 million cash inflow related to the sale of our investment in Mesoblast Limited ("Mesoblast") during fiscal 2018. 

Under our credit agreement and our notes, the proceeds from the sale of assets and businesses must be either reinvested into capital expenditures or business development activities within one year of the respective transaction or we are required to make prepayments on our term loans and offer to repurchase certain of our notes.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $185.6 million for fiscal 2020, compared with $280.1 million for fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily attributable to a $110.6 million decrease in debt repayments, net of issuances. Our current year debt repayments included a $119.8 million payment on the remaining principal amount of the 4.875% senior unsecured notes that had a maturity date of April 15, 2020 (the "2020 Notes"), and $19.7 million in aggregate payments on our variable-rate term loans. The significant components of our debt repayments during fiscal 2019 included aggregate debt repayments of $286.4 million on our variable-rate term loans, open market debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $492.1 million and a repayment of $250.0 million on the receivable securitization program. These repayments were partially offset by a net draw of $680.0 million on our revolving credit facility.

Net cash used in financing activities was $280.1 million for fiscal 2019, compared with $1,095.0 million for fiscal 2018. The $814.9 million decrease was primarily attributable to a $748.5 million decrease in debt repayments and a $54.9 million decrease in shares repurchased. The significant components of our debt repayments during fiscal 2018 included $680.0 million related to our revolving credit facility, a $225.0 million repayment of the variable-rate term loan maturing in 2024, repayment of $366.0 million of assumed debt from the Sucampo acquisition, a $300.0 million repayment of fully matured unsecured fixed rate notes and open market debt repurchases that aggregated to a total principal amount of $81.8 million.

71

Inflation

Inflationary pressures have had an adverse effect on us through higher raw material and fuel costs. We have entered into commodity swap contracts in the past to mitigate the impact of rising prices and may do so in the future. If these contracts are not effective or we are not able to achieve price increases on our products, we may continue to be impacted by these increased costs.

Concentration of Credit and Other Risks

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of accounts receivable. We generally do not require collateral from customers. A portion of our accounts receivable outside the U.S. includes sales to government-owned or supported healthcare systems in several countries, which are subject to payment delays. Payment is dependent upon the financial stability and creditworthiness of those countries' national economies. 

Debt and Capitalization

As of December 25, 2020, total debt principal was $5,283.3 million, of which $1,660.7 million was classified within liabilities subject to compromise on the consolidated balance sheet, compared with $5,422.8 million as of December 27, 2019, with total debt reduction of $139.5 million during fiscal 2020. Total debt principal at December 25, 2020 is comprised of the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The variable-rate term loan interest rates are based on LIBOR, subject to a minimum LIBOR level of 0.75% with interest payments generally expected to be payable every 90 days, and requires quarterly principal payments equal to 0.25% of the original principal amount. As of December 25, 2020, our fixed-rate instruments had a weighted-average interest rate of 7.05% and pay interest at various dates throughout the fiscal year. As of December 25, 2020, we were fully drawn on our $900.0 million revolving credit facility.

In November 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to reduce our outstanding debt at our discretion. As conditions warrant, and subject to limitations under Chapter 11, we may repurchase debt securities issued by us, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. 

2020 Notes

On April 7, 2020, we and Mallinckrodt International Finance S.A. and Mallinckrodt CB LLC, two of our wholly owned subsidiaries ( “Issuers”), entered into an exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with certain third parties (collectively, the “Exchanging Holders”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Exchanging Holders agreed to exchange with the Issuers, on April 7, 2020, their holdings of the 2020 Notes issued by the Issuers (the “Existing Notes”) (consisting of approximately $495.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Existing Notes) for new 10.00% First Lien Senior Secured Notes due 2025 issued by the Issuers (the “First Lien 2025 Notes”), at a rate of $1,000 of First Lien 2025 Notes for every $1,000 of Existing Notes exchanged (such exchange, the “Exchange”). The Issuers and Exchanging Holders consummated the Exchange on April 7, 2020.

Interest on the First Lien 2025 Notes is contractually payable semi-annually in cash on April 15th and October 15th of each year, commencing on October 15, 2020. The Bankruptcy Court order permitting the use of cash collateral to finance the Chapter 11 Cases requires that we make cash adequate protection payments quarterly during the pendency of the proceedings on the first lien senior notes and the second lien senior notes for, among other things, unpaid pre-petition and post-petition interest (at the specified non-default interest rate) and reimbursement of certain costs.

The Issuers may redeem some or all of the First Lien 2025 Notes prior to April 15, 2022 by paying a “make-whole” premium. The Issuers may redeem some or all of the First Lien 2025 Notes on or after April 15, 2022 at specified redemption prices. In addition, prior to April 15, 2022, the Issuers may redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the First Lien 2025 Notes with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings. The Issuers may also redeem all, but not less than all, of the First Lien 2025 Notes at any time at a 

72

price of 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, in the event the Issuers become obligated to pay additional amounts as a result of changes affecting certain withholding tax laws applicable to payments on the First Lien 2025 Notes.

The Issuers are obligated to offer to repurchase (a) all of the First Lien 2025 Notes at a price of 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, as a result of certain change of control events and (b) First Lien 2025 Notes using asset sale proceeds at a price of 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, in the event of certain asset sales. These obligations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.

The First Lien 2025 Notes are subject to an indenture that contains certain customary covenants and events of default (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods). The occurrence of an event of default under the indenture could result in the acceleration of the First Lien 2025 Notes and could cause a cross-default that could result in the acceleration of our other indebtedness. The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on October 12, 2020 constituted an event of default and accordingly, the principal balance of this debt instrument was classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2020. However, any efforts to enforce payment obligations under the debt instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. 

The First Lien 2025 Notes are jointly and severally guaranteed, on a secured, unsubordinated basis by us and each of our subsidiaries (other than the Issuers) (the “Note Guarantors”) that guarantees the obligations under the Issuers’ existing senior secured credit facilities, subject to certain exceptions.

The First Lien 2025 Notes and the guarantees thereof are secured by liens on the same assets of the Issuers and the Note Guarantors that are subject to liens securing the existing senior secured credit facilities, subject to certain exceptions.

On April 15, 2020, we paid in full the remaining approximately $119.8 million in principal amount of outstanding 2020 Notes at the maturity thereof with cash on hand.

The risks associated with the failure to consummate the Proposed Settlement are further described in the risk factor “The Amended Proposed Opioid-Related Litigation Settlement and Proposed Acthar Gel-Related Settlement are subject to certain contingencies and may not go into effect in their current form or at all, which may have an adverse impact on our ability to consummate the Plan and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.” in Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors."

The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on October 12, 2020 constituted an event of default under certain of our debt agreements. As of December 25, 2020, other than any defaults relating to the Chapter 11 Cases, we were in full compliance with the provisions and covenants associated with our debt agreements. Accordingly, all long-term debt was classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2020. However, any efforts to enforce payment obligations under the debt instruments are automatically stayed as a result of the Chapter 11 Cases. 

For additional information regarding the Chapter 11 Cases and our debt agreements, refer to Note 2 and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, respectively.

Capitalization

Shareholders' equity was $1,019.2 million at December 25, 2020 compared with $1,940.7 million at December 27, 2019. The decrease in shareholders' equity is primarily attributed to the fiscal 2020 net loss.

From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors have authorized share repurchase programs. We did not make any share repurchases during fiscal 2020 or fiscal 2019, due to our shift to debt reduction as one of our primary focuses of our capital allocation strategy in fiscal 2019. For further information, refer to Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Dividends

Historically, we have not made any cash dividend payments, as we have retained earnings to finance acquisitions, R&D and the operation and expansion of our business, while executing disciplined capital allocation. Currently, the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court until such proceedings are complete upon emergence.

Commitments and Contingencies

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 25, 2020 (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases on October 12, 2020 constituted an event of default under certain of our debt agreements. Accordingly, all long-term debt was classified as current on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2020. Certain of our long-term debt instruments are classified as liabilities subject to compromise, for which no principal payments will be made during the pendency of the proceedings

(2)Interest on long-term debt obligations are projected for future periods using interest rates in effect as of December 25, 2020. Contractual obligations under the long-term debt agreements have been shown in the table above. Certain of our long-term debt instruments are classified as liabilities subject to compromise, for which no interest payments will be made during the pendency of the proceedings. Certain of these projected interest payments may differ in the future based on changes in market interest rates. 

As previously discussed in 'Significant Events', we are contractually obligated under the cash collateral order approved by the Bankruptcy Court to make cash adequate protection payments on the senior secured revolving credit facility and the senior secured term loans at a rate that is 200 basis points greater than the otherwise applicable non-default rate based on LIBOR. Under the cash collateral order, we will make approximately $43.3 million of incremental interest payments as a result thereof within twelve months of the December 25, 2020 balance sheet date, which is subject to change based on timing of emergence from bankruptcy. This incremental expense, which has provisionally been classified as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations, is not included within this table as we expect such incremental expense to be reclassified as a reduction in principal in connection with the confirmation of a plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court.

(3)Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

(4)Purchase obligations consist of commitments for purchases of goods and services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements. 

The preceding table does not include other liabilities of $2,836.2 million, primarily consisting of the opioid-related litigation settlement liability of $1,600.0 million, the Medicaid lawsuit liability of $638.9 million and obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans, unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and related accrued interest and penalties, contingent consideration liabilities, environmental liabilities, asset retirement obligations and liabilities subject to compromise, because the timing of their future cash outflow is uncertain. The most significant of these liabilities, other than the opioid-related settlement liability and Medicaid lawsuit liability which are discussed in Note 20 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are discussed below.

As part of our acquisitions, we are subject to contractual arrangements to pay contingent consideration to former owners of these businesses. The payment of obligations under these arrangements are uncertain, and even if payments are expected to be made the timing of these payments may be uncertain as well. As of December 25, 2020, we have accrued $34.7 million for these potential payments, which have been classified as liabilities subject to compromise. For further information on our contingent consideration arrangements, refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As part of our divestitures and licensing agreements, we have the potential to earn in excess of $50.0 million in milestone payments in the future. During fiscal 2020, we received preferred equity certificates of $9.0 million and royalty income of $0.8 million. During fiscal 2019, we received royalty income of $39.0 million and preferred equity certificates of $9.0 million. During fiscal 2018, we received royalty income of $15.5 million, milestone payments of $6.0 million and preferred equity certificates of $9.0 million. For further information, refer to Notes 6 and 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

We are obligated to pay royalties under certain agreements with third parties. During fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made payments under these arrangements of $81.9 million, $95.7 million and $106.4 million, respectively. The timing and amounts to be paid in future periods are uncertain as they are dependent upon net sales generated in future periods.

Non-current income taxes payable, primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits, is included within other income tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and, as of December 25, 2020, was $100.1 million. Payment of these liabilities is uncertain and, even if payments are determined to be necessary, they are subject to the timing of rulings by the taxing authorities related to tax positions we take. For further information on income tax related matters, refer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

74

As of December 25, 2020, we had net unfunded pension and postretirement benefit obligations of $29.4 million and $40.1 million, respectively. The timing and amounts of long-term funding requirements for pension and postretirement obligations are uncertain. We do not anticipate making material involuntary contributions in fiscal 2021, but may elect to make voluntary contributions to our defined pension plans or our postretirement benefit plans during fiscal 2021. As a result of our Chapter 11 filing on October 12, 2020, $32.4 million of defined benefit obligations have been reclassified as liabilities subject to compromise on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2020, which included the U.S. pension benefit plans and a portion of the postretirement benefit plans.

We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation matters at a number of sites. The ultimate cost of cleanup and timing of future cash outlays is difficult to predict given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods. As of December 25, 2020, we believe that it is probable that we will incur investigation and remediation costs of approximately $60.8 million, of which $1.0 million is included in accrued and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet at December 25, 2020. Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides additional information regarding environmental matters.

Legal Proceedings

We are subject to various legal proceedings and claims, including present and former operations, including those described in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 7. Although it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe, unless otherwise indicated, given the information currently available, that their ultimate resolution should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Guarantees

In disposing of assets or businesses, we have historically provided representations, warranties and indemnities to cover various risks and liabilities, including unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities related to periods prior to disposition. We assess the probability of potential liabilities related to such representations, warranties and indemnities and adjust potential liabilities as a result of changes in facts and circumstances. We believe, given the information currently available, that their ultimate resolutions will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. These representations, warranties and indemnities are discussed in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 25, 2020, we had various other letters of credit, guarantee and surety bonds totaling $31.7 million and restricted cash of $37.4 million held in segregated accounts primarily to collateralize surety bonds for the Company's environmental liabilities. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in U.S. dollars and in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. The following accounting policies are based on, among other things, judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risks and uncertainties. Management's estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period.

Liabilities Subject to Compromise

As a result of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Cases, the payment of pre-petition liabilities is subject to compromise or other treatment pursuant to a plan of reorganization. The determination of how liabilities will ultimately be settled or treated cannot be made until the Bankruptcy Court confirms a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization and such plan becomes effective. Accordingly, the ultimate amount of such liabilities is not determinable at this time. Pre-petition liabilities that are subject to compromise are to be reported at the amounts expected to be allowed by the Bankruptcy Court, even if they may be settled for different amounts. The amounts currently classified as liabilities subject to compromise are preliminary and may be subject to future adjustments depending on Bankruptcy 

75

Court actions, further developments with respect to disputed claims, determinations of the secured status of certain claims, the values of any collateral securing such claims, rejection of executory contracts, continued reconciliation or other events.

Revenue Recognition

Product Sales Revenue

We sell products through independent channels, including direct to retail pharmacies, end user customers and through distributors who resell our products to retail pharmacies, institutions and end user customers, while certain products are sold and distributed directly to hospitals. We also enter into arrangements with indirect customers, such as health care providers and payers, wholesalers, government agencies, institutions, managed care organizations and GPOs to establish contract pricing for certain products that provides for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, sale incentives, chargebacks, distribution service agreement fees, fees for services and administration fees and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products. 

Reserve for Variable Considerations

Product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for which reserves are established. These reserves result from estimated chargebacks, rebates, product returns and other sales deductions that are offered within contracts between us and our customers, health care providers and payers relating to the sale of our products. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales and are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to the customer) or a current liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than a customer). Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes that are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as our historical experience, estimated future trends, estimated customer inventory levels, current contracted sales terms with customers, level of utilization of our products and other competitive factors. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimate of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration that is included in the transaction price may be constrained (reduced), and is included in the net sales price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. We adjust reserves for chargebacks, rebates, product returns and other sales deductions to reflect differences between estimated and actual experience. Such adjustments impact the amount of net sales recognized in the period of adjustment.

 The following table reflects activity in our sales reserve accounts (dollars in millions):

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Excludes the $105.1 million that is reflected as a component of operating expenses as it represents a pre-acquisition contingency related to the portion of the liability that arose from sales of Acthar Gel prior to the Company's acquisition of Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc. in August 2014. For further information, refer to Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Provisions presented in the table above are recorded as reductions to net sales. For our presentation of net sales by product family, refer to Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Total provisions for fiscal 2020 increased $252.6 million compared with fiscal 2019, which is inclusive of the $536.0 million provision for the Medicaid lawsuit incurred in fiscal 2020. Excluding the impact of the Medicaid lawsuit, the decrease in rebates and chargebacks of $281.4 million primarily related to a decrease of $315.2 million in the Specialty Generics segment driven by decreased pricing resulting in lower chargeback amounts, offset by a $33.8 million increase in Specialty Brands. Provisions for returns increased $6.7 million driven by the Specialty Generics segment, and other sales deductions increased by $8.7 million from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020. 

Total provisions for fiscal 2019 increased $50.2 million compared with fiscal 2018. The increase in rebates and chargebacks of $66.0 million primarily related to an increase in $49.3 million in the Specialty Generics segment as our distributors incurred higher 

76

chargebacks as compared to our direct customers, coupled with a $16.7 million increase in Specialty Brands. Provisions for returns decreased $17.1 million driven by the Specialty Generics segment primarily related to discontinuation of select products in fiscal 2019, and other sales deductions increased by $1.3 million from fiscal 2018 to fiscal 2019. 

Product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of our product. Control is transferred either at a point in time, generally upon delivery to the customer site, or in the case of certain of our products, over the period in which the customer has access to the product and related services. Revenue recognized over time is based upon either consumption of the product or passage of time based upon our determination of the measure that best aligns with how the obligation is satisfied. Our considerations of why such measures provide a faithful depiction of the transfer of our products are as follows:

For those contracts whereby revenue is recognized over time based upon consumption of the product, we either have:

1.the right to invoice the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of our performance to date, for which the practical expedient to recognize in proportion to the amount it has the right to invoice has been applied, or

2.the remaining goods and services to which the customer is entitled is diminished upon consumption.

For those contracts whereby revenue is recognized over time based upon the passage of time, the benefit that the customer receives from unlimited access to our product does not vary, regardless of consumption. As a result, our obligation diminishes with the passage of time; therefore, ratable recognition of the transaction price over the contract period is the measure that best aligns with how the obligation is satisfied.

Costs to obtain a contract

As the majority of our contracts are short-term in nature, sales commissions are generally expensed when incurred as the amortization period would have been less than one year. These costs are recorded within SG&A. For contracts that extend beyond one year, the incremental expense recognition matches the recognition of related revenue.

Costs to fulfill a contract

We capitalize the costs associated with the devices used in our portfolio of drug-device combination products, which are used in satisfaction of future performance obligations. Capital expenditures for these devices represent cash outflows for our cost to produce the asset, which is classified in property, plant and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets and expensed to cost of sales over the useful life of the equipment.

Product Royalty Revenues

We license certain rights to Amitiza to a third party in exchange for royalties on net sales of the product. We recognize such royalty revenue as the related sales occur.

Contract Balances

Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Payments received from customers are typically based upon payment terms of between 30 to 90 days depending on the customer. We do not maintain contract asset balances aside from the accounts receivable balance as presented on the consolidated balance sheets as costs to obtain a contract are expensed when incurred as the amortization period would have been less than one year. These costs are recorded within SG&A. 

Contract liabilities are recorded when cash payments are received in advance of our performance, including amounts which are refundable.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

During fiscal 2018, our annual goodwill impairment analysis resulted in the recognition of a full goodwill impairment of $3,672.8 million related to our Specialty Brands reporting unit. As a result, we did not have a goodwill balance during fiscal 2020 or 2019. Prior to this full impairment, we tested goodwill on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In performing goodwill assessments, management relies on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, internally developed cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to the analysis of goodwill impairment. Since judgment is involved in performing goodwill valuation analyses, there is risk that the carrying value of our goodwill may be overstated or understated. The impairment test is comprised of comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its estimated fair value. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit through internal analyses and valuation, utilizing an income approach (a level three measurement technique) based on the present value of future cash flows. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. The fair value of our reporting

units is reconciled to our share price and market capitalization as a corroborative step. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we recognize the excess of the carrying value over the fair value as a goodwill impairment loss.

Intangible assets include completed technology, licenses, trademarks and IPR&D. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value, while intangible assets acquired in other transactions are recorded at cost. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized, generally using the straight-line method over five to thirty years. We assess the remaining useful life and the recoverability of finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. When a triggering event occurs, we evaluate potential impairment of finite-lived intangible assets by first comparing undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, the amount of potential impairment is measured by comparing the fair value of the assets with their carrying value. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable by either a qualitative or income approach. We compare the fair value of the assets with their carrying value and record an impairment when the carrying value exceeds the fair value. The fair value of the intangible asset is estimated using an income approach, using similar assumptions as used in our goodwill valuation. If the fair value is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and the present value of future cash flows. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in intangible asset impairment in future periods. 

For more information on our goodwill and intangible impairment analyses and the results thereof, refer to Notes 3 and 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Acquisitions

For acquisitions that meet the criteria for business combination accounting, the amounts paid are allocated to the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations. These valuations rely on a number of factors including operating results, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, transactions and market place data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and judgment in applying them to estimate the fair value of individual assets acquired in a business combination. Due to these inherent uncertainties, there is risk that the carrying value of our recorded intangible assets and goodwill may be overstated, which may result in an increased risk of impairment in future periods. We perform our intangible asset valuations using an income approach based on the present value of future cash flows. This approach incorporates many assumptions including future growth rates, discount factors and income tax rates. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions could result in impairment in future periods.

Our purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date of in-process projects that have not reached technological feasibility. The primary basis for determining technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval.

The fair value of IPR&D is determined using the discounted cash flow method. In determining the fair value of IPR&D, we consider, among other factors, appraisals, the stage of completion of the projects, the technological feasibility of the projects, whether the projects have an alternative future use and the estimated residual cash flows that could be generated from the various projects and technologies over their respective projected economic lives. The discount rate used includes a rate of return that accounts for the time value of money, as well as risk factors that reflect the economic risk that the cash flows projected may not be realized.

The fair value attributable to IPR&D projects at the time of acquisition is capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and tested annually for impairment until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon completion of the project, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the indefinite-lived intangible asset is charged to expense.

Certain asset acquisitions or license agreements may not meet the criteria for a business combination. We account for these transactions as an asset acquisition and recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired entity. Any initial up-front payments incurred in connection with the acquisition or licensing of IPR&D product candidates that do not meet the definition of a business are treated as research and development expense.

Contingent Consideration

As part of certain acquisitions, we are subject to contractual arrangements to pay contingent consideration to former owners of these businesses. The payment of obligations under these arrangements are uncertain, and even if payments are expected to be made the timing of these payments may be uncertain as well. These contingent consideration obligations are required to be recorded at fair value within the consolidated balance sheet and adjusted at each respective balance sheet date, with changes in the fair value being recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. The determination of fair value is dependent upon a number of factors, which include projections of future revenues, the probability of successfully achieving certain regulatory milestones, competitive entrants into the marketplace, the timing associated with the aforementioned criteria and market place data (e.g., interest rates). Several of these assumptions require projections several years into the future. Due to these inherent uncertainties, there is risk that the contingent consideration liabilities may be overstated or understated. Changes in economic and operating conditions impacting these assumptions are expected to impact future operating results, with the magnitude of the impact tied to the significance in the change in assumptions. For additional information, refer to Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contingencies

We are involved, either as a plaintiff or a defendant, in various legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, including, without limitation, patent infringement claims, product liability matters, government investigations, environmental matters, employment disputes, contractual disputes and other commercial disputes, and other legal proceedings as further discussed in Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included within Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Accruals recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, self-insurance and other claims, are based on judgment, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel, internal and/or external technical consultants and actuarially determined estimates. When a range is established but a best estimate cannot be made, we record the minimum loss contingency amount. These estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known, and the estimates are reevaluated each accounting period as additional information becomes available. When we are initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss, we record the minimum amount of loss, which could be zero. As information becomes known, additional loss provisions are recorded when either a best estimate can be made or the minimum loss amount is increased. When events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected, our best estimate is changed to a lower amount. We record receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the related liability when we have determined that existing insurance policies will provide reimbursement. In making this determination, we consider applicable deductibles, policy limits and the historical payment experience of the insurance carriers. Receivables are not netted against the related liabilities for financial statement presentation.

Income Taxes

In determining income for financial statement purposes, we must make certain estimates and judgments. These estimates and judgments affect the calculation of certain tax liabilities and the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets, which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense.

Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years and our forecast of future taxable income. In estimating future taxable income, we develop assumptions including the amount of future state, federal and international pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences, and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses.

As previously discussed, we concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date of issuance of the consolidated financial statements. We considered this in determining that certain net deferred tax assets were no longer more likely than not realizable. As a result, we recorded an increase in a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Our income tax benefit or expense recorded in the future may be impacted to the extent of changes in our valuation allowances.

We determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. The tax benefit of any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is calculated as the largest amount that is more than 50.0% likely of being realized upon resolution of the uncertainty. To the extent a full benefit is not realized on the uncertain tax position, an income tax liability, or a reduction to a deferred tax asset (“contra-DTA”), is established. We adjust these liabilities and contra-DTAs as a result of changing facts and circumstances; however; due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities. 

79

The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Management is not aware of any such changes, however, which would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
