ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risk associated with interest rates, foreign currency and commodity fluctuations. We occasionally utilize derivative instruments as part of our overall financial risk management policy, but do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes. In 2019 and 2020, the Company entered into U.S. Dollar to Euro cross currency swap contracts to hedge the Companyâ€™s net investment in its European operations. The contracts have been designated as net investment hedges and have various maturity dates. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The Company entered into forward foreign currency exchange contracts during 2020 to hedge against value changes in foreign currency. There were no material contracts outstanding at December 31, 2020. Forward foreign currency exchange contracts are described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We believe we may experience continuing losses from foreign currency fluctuations. However, we do not expect currency translation, transaction or hedging contract losses to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
