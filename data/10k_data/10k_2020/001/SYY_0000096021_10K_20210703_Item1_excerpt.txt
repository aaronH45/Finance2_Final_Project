PART I

Item 1.  Business

Unless this Form 10-K indicates otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Sysco,” or “the company” as used in this Form 10-K refer to Sysco Corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries and divisions.

Overview

Sysco Corporation, acting through its subsidiaries and divisions, is the largest global distributor of food and related products primarily to the foodservice or food-away-from-home industry. Our purpose is “Connecting the World to Share Food and Care for One Another.” We provided products and related services to over 650,000 customer locations, including restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers during fiscal 2021. 

Founded in 1969, Sysco commenced operations as a public company in March 1970 when the stockholders of nine companies exchanged their stock for Sysco common stock. Since our formation, we have grown from $115 million to as high as $60.1 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2019, both through internal expansion of existing operations and through acquisitions. Sysco’s annual sales in fiscal 2021 were $51.3 billion.

Sysco’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to June 30th. This resulted in a 53-week year ended July 3, 2021 for fiscal 2021, a 52-week year ended June 27, 2020 for fiscal 2020 and a 52-week year ended June 29, 2019 for fiscal 2019. We will have a 52-week year ending July 2, 2022 for fiscal 2022.

Sysco Corporation is organized under the laws of Delaware. The address and telephone number of our executive offices are 1390 Enclave Parkway, Houston, Texas 77077-2099, (281) 584-1390. This annual report on Form 10-K, as well as all other reports filed or furnished by Sysco pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are available free of charge on Sysco’s website at www.sysco.com as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Reporting Segments

Sysco distributes food and related products to restaurants, healthcare and educational facilities, lodging establishments and other foodservice customers. Our primary operations are located in North America and Europe. Under the accounting provisions related to disclosures about segments of an enterprise, we have aggregated certain operating segments into three reportable segments. “Other” financial information is attributable to our other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative disclosure thresholds.

•U.S. Foodservice Operations – primarily includes U.S. Broadline operations, which distribute a full line of food products, including custom-cut meat, seafood, specialty produce, specialty imports and a wide variety of non-food products; 

•International Foodservice Operations – includes operations in the Americas (primarily outside of the United States (U.S.)) and Europe, which distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products. The Americas primarily consists of operations in Canada, Bahamas, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama, as well as our operations that distribute to international customers. Our European operations primarily consist of operations in the United Kingdom (U.K.), France, Ireland and Sweden;

•SYGMA – our U.S. customized distribution operations serving quick-service chain restaurant customer locations; and

•Other – primarily our hotel supply operations, Guest Worldwide. Sysco sold its interests in Cake Corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Broadline operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to both traditional and chain restaurant customers, hospitals, schools, hotels, industrial caterers and other venues where foodservice products are served. SYGMA operating sites distribute a full line of food products and a wide variety of non-food products to certain chain restaurant customer locations. Selected financial data for each of our reportable segments, as well as financial information concerning geographic areas, can be found in Note 21, “Business Segment Information,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Customers and Products

Sysco’s customers in the foodservice industry include restaurants, hospitals and nursing homes, schools and colleges, hotels and motels, industrial caterers and other similar venues where foodservice products are served.

The products we distribute include:

•frozen foods, such as meats, seafood, fully prepared entrées, fruits, vegetables and desserts;

•canned and dry foods;

•fresh meats and seafood;

•dairy products;

•beverage products;

•imported specialties; and

•fresh produce.

We also supply a wide variety of non-food items, including:

•paper products such as disposable napkins, plates and cups;

•tableware such as china and silverware;

•cookware such as pots, pans and utensils;

•restaurant and kitchen equipment and supplies; and

•cleaning supplies.

A comparison of the sales mix in the principal product categories during the last three years is presented below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other sales relate to non-food products, including textiles and amenities for our hotel supply business, equipment and subscription sales for our previously-owned Cake business, and other janitorial products, medical supplies and smallwares. We sold our interests in Cake Corporation in the first quarter of fiscal 2021.

Our distribution centers, which we refer to as operating sites, distribute branded merchandise, as well as products packaged under our private brands. Products packaged under our private brands have been manufactured for Sysco according to specifications that have been developed by our quality assurance team. In addition, our quality assurance team certifies the manufacturing and processing plants where these products are packaged, enforces our quality control standards and identifies supply sources that satisfy our requirements.

We believe that prompt and accurate delivery of orders, competitive pricing, customer service and the ability to provide a full array of products and services to assist customers in their foodservice operations are of primary importance in the marketing and distribution of foodservice products to our customers. Our operating sites offer daily delivery to certain customer locations and have the capability of delivering special orders on short notice. Through the sales and marketing representatives and support staff, we stay informed of the needs of our customers and acquaint them with new products and services. We also provide ancillary services relating to foodservice distribution, such as providing customers with product usage reports and other data, menu-planning advice, food safety training and assistance in inventory control, as well as access to various third-party services designed to add value to our customers’ businesses.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of Sysco’s total sales for the fiscal year ended July 3, 2021.

We estimate that our sales by type of customer during the past three fiscal years were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Other includes cafeterias that are not stand-alone restaurants, bakeries, caterers, churches, civic and fraternal organizations, vending distributors, other distributors and international exports, as well as retail food sales and logistics services. None of these types of customers, as a group, exceeded 5% of total sales in any of the years for which information is presented.

We estimate that sales to our customers in the food service management (FSM) sector, which include large customers that service cafeterias in institutions such as universities, hospitals, and sporting venues, accounted for just over 5% of sales in fiscal 2021. These sales are reflected within the respective customer types listed in the table above, depending on the type of customer the FSM operator serves.

Sources of Supply

We purchase from thousands of suppliers, both domestic and international, none of which individually accounts for more than 10% of our purchases. These suppliers consist generally of large corporations selling brand name and private label merchandise, as well as independent regional brand and private label processors and packers. We also provide specialty and seasonal products from small to mid-sized producers to meet a growing demand for locally sourced products. Our locally sourced products, including produce, meats, cheese and other products, help differentiate our customers’ offerings, satisfy demands for new products, and support local communities. Purchasing is generally carried out through both centrally developed purchasing programs, domestically and internationally, and direct purchasing programs established by our various operating sites.

We administer a consolidated product procurement program designed to develop, obtain and ensure consistent quality food and non-food products. The program covers the purchasing and marketing of branded merchandise, as well as products from a number of national brand suppliers, encompassing substantially all product lines. Some of our products are purchased internationally within global procurement centers in order to build strategic relationships with international suppliers and to optimize our supply chain network. We also focus on increasing profitability by lowering operating costs and by lowering aggregate inventory levels, which reduces future facility expansion needs at our operating sites, while providing greater value to our suppliers and customers.

Working Capital Practices

Our growth is funded through a combination of significant cash on hand, incremental cash flow from operations, commercial paper issuances and long-term borrowings. See the discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding our liquidity, financial position and sources and uses of funds. 

We extend credit terms to some of our customers based on our assessment of each customer’s creditworthiness. We monitor each customer’s account and will suspend shipments if necessary.

A majority of our sales orders are filled within 24 hours of when customer orders are placed. We generally maintain inventory on hand to be able to meet customer demand. The level of inventory on hand will vary by product depending on shelf-life, supplier order fulfillment lead times and customer demand. We also make purchases of additional volumes of certain products based on supply or pricing opportunities.

We take advantage of suppliers’ cash discounts where appropriate, otherwise we pay out suppliers according to our payment terms.

Corporate Headquarters

Our corporate staff makes available a number of services to our operating sites and our shared services staff performs support activities for employees, suppliers and customers. Members of these group possess experience and expertise in, among other areas, customer and vendor contract administration, accounting and finance, treasury, legal, information technology, payroll and employee benefits, risk management and insurance, sales and marketing, merchandising, inbound logistics, human resources, strategy and tax compliance services. The corporate office also makes available supply chain expertise, such as in warehousing and distribution services, which provide assistance in operational best practices, including space utilization, energy conservation, fleet management and work flow.

Capital Improvements

During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, $470.7 million, $720.4 million and $692.4 million, respectively, were invested in facilities, technology, equipment, delivery fleet and other capital asset enhancements. From time to time, we dispose of assets in the normal course of business; we consider proceeds from these asset sales to be an offset to capital expenditures. During fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, were $411.5 million, $691.7 million and $671.5 million, respectively. Capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, as a percentage of sales during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were 0.8%, 1.3% and 1.1%, respectively. In order to preserve our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our expected capital expenditures by eliminating capital projects that were not critical for our business. We estimate our capital expenditures, net of proceeds from sales of assets, in fiscal 2022 will be approximately 1.3% of fiscal 2022 sales, as we continue to invest in our business for the long-term. During the three years ended July 3, 2021, capital expenditures were financed primarily by internally generated funds, our commercial paper program and bank and other borrowings. We expect to finance our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures from internally generated funds.

Human Capital Resources

Sysco believes engaged and empowered associates drive business success and that attracting, developing and retaining the best talent globally to drive our business success is a key driver of the company’s long-term value. Our diverse associates and inclusive culture create an environment where associates can develop their skills and contribute to our success by driving strong financial performance. Sysco’s Board of Directors, through its Compensation and Leadership Development Committee, together with Sysco’s chief executive officer and chief human resources officer, are tasked with providing oversight of our human capital strategy, which consists of (1) talent acquisition, (2) talent management, (3) total rewards, (4) diversity, equity and inclusion and (5) health, well-being and safety. As of July 3, 2021, we had approximately 58,000 employees, including approximately 40,000 U.S. employees and approximately 18,000 employees outside the United States, as compared to approximately 57,000 employees as of June 27, 2020. As of July 3, 2021, approximately 99% of our U.S.-based associates are classified as full-time associates, defined as employees who work 30 or more hours per week.

Collective Bargaining Agreements — As of July 3, 2021, approximately 19% of our employees were represented by unions, primarily the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and unions in France and Sweden. Contract negotiations are handled by each individual operating site with support from our Labor Relations team. Approximately 1.2% of our union employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to renegotiation in fiscal 2022. Since July 3, 2021, there have been two contract renegotiations. We consider our labor relations to be satisfactory.

COVID-19 Response — We have been actively responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact globally. Our highest priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and working with our employees and network of suppliers and customers to help maintain the global food supply chain. We have defined and implemented procedures to protect the health and safety of our employees, while also ensuring business continuity and our ability to service our customers. We have allowed employees to work remotely whenever possible and have installed protocols for daily temperature checks and health screenings for our employees not working remotely. We have also provided guidelines for performing deep cleaning and proper social distancing in our offices and warehouses and have implemented requirements for employees to wear face coverings when not working remotely. Given the unprecedented challenges brought on by COVID-19, in April 2020 we launched a global mental health and well-being campaign that continues to be a primary focus for Sysco. 

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020, we made a reduction to our staffing levels through both temporary workforce furloughs and permanent reductions in force. As business conditions improved in the second half of fiscal 2021, we hired over 6,000 additional sales consultants, new business developers, culinary experts and operations associates in preparation for the incremental volume associated with the expected business recovery. Sysco is monitoring the spread of variants of COVID-19, and while the future impact of the disease on our business is uncertain, we will respond appropriately to

maintain the health and safety of our associates. For more information on our COVID-19 workplace and community response, see our COVID-19 disclosures in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

Talent Acquisition and Talent Management — Maintaining a pipeline of talent is critical to Sysco’s ongoing success and is essential to our succession planning efforts and to growing leaders throughout the organization. Our leadership and teams are responsible for attracting and retaining top talent by facilitating an environment where employees feel supported and encouraged in their professional and personal development. Specifically, we promote employee development by cultivating a high-impact learning culture for Sysco associates through a variety of enterprise development programs and learning resources, growing associates through goal-setting and career development processes, and reviewing strategic positions regularly and identifying potential internal candidates to fill those roles. We commit to investing in our employees through on the job experiences and coaching, as well as tuition reimbursement for a majority of our employees in the U.S. to promote continued professional growth. Additionally, we understand the importance of providing competitive compensation and benefits, as well as appropriate training that cultivates growth, developmental opportunities and multiple career paths within the company.

A key focus of Sysco’s Talent Acquisition in fiscal 2021 has been achieving hiring targets for our transportation associates. Throughout our industry, drivers are in short supply and hiring is a challenge. Sysco has developed partnerships with driving school organizations, on a national and local level, to support hiring across our U.S. sites. We encourage our business locations to partner with high schools to recruit non-college bound future graduates to consider a career path that will take them from a warehouse selector to a driver position and beyond. Our current national partner helps to identify a diverse slate of unemployed or underemployed individuals who aspire to be commercially qualified drivers and present them to Sysco as candidates for tuition sponsorship and subsequent hire; and our partner provides training to existing Sysco associates who choose to pursue a driving career. Sysco also has an in-house network of Supply Chain Instructors who ensure that we successfully onboard and train new drivers and support them as they learn how to deliver product to our customers safely and efficiently. In fiscal 2022, Sysco is investing in its first Sysco Driver Academy that will enable us to train our own drivers. For example, this program will give our warehouse associate population an opportunity to become drivers. Trainees will be paid to attend the academy, and Sysco will pay the licensing and certification fees. In return, associates will sign a contract to work for Sysco for an agreed upon period of time. If successful, we may expand the program nationally within the U.S.

Furthermore, through a program entitled Sysco Speaks, we conduct annual, confidential engagement surveys of our global workforce that are administered and analyzed by an independent third party. All Sysco associates across our global operations are invited to participate, and 86% of associates completed the survey in fiscal 2021. Aggregate survey results are reviewed by executive officers and the Board of Directors. By acting on results, both at an aggregate enterprise level and a department/business/work group level, and by analyzing our scores compared to both global and internal benchmarks, we have been able to enhance our culture and improve our overall engagement levels.

Total Rewards — We are committed to equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, race, ethnicity or other personal characteristics. To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider various factors, such as an employee’s role and experience, job location and performance. We also regularly review our compensation practices to promote fair and equitable pay. In fiscal 2021, Sysco’s hourly associates received an average hourly wage of $28.46, and 100% of associates in our U.S. distribution facilities received pay above state minimum wage thresholds. Along with equitable pay, total rewards for Sysco’s full-time associates include paid vacation and sick time benefits, short-term and long-term incentives, retirement plans, training and development, access to career opportunities, paid pregnancy and adoption leave benefits, health and welfare, and recognition, as well as other programs like dependent scholarships and employee discounts.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion — Sysco’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) team develops global strategic initiatives that are implemented locally to ensure that the needs specific to each region are addressed. To accelerate our global efforts to create a more diverse workforce and an equitable and inclusive culture, Sysco hired its Vice President, Chief Diversity Officer in fiscal 2021. Also, in fiscal 2021, we launched our Global DEI Advisory Council, which has been tasked with creating our three-year DEI Roadmap and our Real Talk Dialogues, which provide leaders and their associates safe forums to have open, honest, two-way and completely voluntary conversations. Sysco’s chief executive officer signed the CEO Pledge, as part of the CEO Action for Racial Equity, a group that includes business leaders from across the Fortune 100 companies. In addition, Sysco is a member of the Business Coalition for Equality Act, a group of U.S. employers that support legislation providing the same protections for LGBTQ+ associates as other protected groups under federal law.

At the end of fiscal 2021, women held 24% of U.S. management roles (defined as managers of people) and 24% of officer roles (defined as the executives and senior level positions within the corporate office and field organizations). For our U.S. leadership, Hispanic or Latinx, Black or African American, and Asian employees held 12%, 8% and 4% of management roles (defined as managers of people), respectively, at the end of fiscal 2021.

Our Associate Resource Groups (ARGs) are voluntary, associate-led groups organized to foster a diverse, inclusive workplace at Sysco, and are a critical element of our engagement and DEI efforts at both our headquarters and at operating sites by interested associates. These groups are effective vehicles for diverse associates to strengthen their skills, build relationships and foster mutually supportive interactions with their Sysco colleagues. By the end of fiscal 2021, twelve ARGs had been formed, representing gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender identification, veterans and generations, among other groups. 

Health, Well-being and Safety — Our occupational health services and total rewards/benefits teams offer a wide range of programs that address the needs of our workforce. We offer our associates and their families programs that support their lives, and we offer programs for U.S. associates that support health, mind, security and community. In fiscal 2020, our environmental compliance, occupational health and safety teams were combined under one central Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) team comprising functional experts across many geographies to address EHS at every point in our business process.

Competition

A large number of companies are engaged in the distribution of food and non-food products to the foodservice industry. Our customers may also choose to purchase products directly from wholesale or retail outlets, including club, cash and carry and grocery stores, online retailers, or negotiate prices directly with our suppliers. While we compete primarily with local and regional distributors, some organizations compete with us on a multi-region basis. In addition, these local, regional and multi-regional distributors can create purchasing cooperatives and marketing groups to enhance their competitive abilities by expanding their product mix, improving purchasing power and extending their geographic capabilities. Our customers are accustomed to purchasing from multiple suppliers and channels concurrently. Customers can choose from many broadline foodservice distributors, specialty distributors that focus on specific categories such as produce, meat or seafood, other wholesale channels, club stores, cash and carry stores, grocery stores and numerous online retailers. Since switching costs are very low, customers can make supplier and channel changes very quickly. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the foodservice industry are effective customer contacts, the ability to deliver a wide range of quality products and related services on a timely and dependable basis and competitive prices. There are few barriers to market entry. Existing foodservice competitors can extend their shipping distances and add truck routes and warehouses relatively quickly to serve new markets or customers.

We estimate that we serve about 17% of the approximately $230 billion annual foodservice market in the U.S., as estimated by Technomic, Inc., for calendar year 2020. Technomic projects the market size to increase to approximately $285 billion by the end of calendar 2021. We also serve certain international geographies that vary in size and amount of market share. We believe, based upon industry trade data, that our sales to the U.S. and Canada food-away-from-home industry were the highest of any foodservice distributor during fiscal 2021. While comprehensive industry statistics are not available, we believe that, in most instances, our operations in the U.S. and Canada are among the leading distributors of food and related non-food products to foodservice customers in those trading areas. We believe our competitive advantages include our sales consultants; our diversified product base, which includes quality-assured Sysco brand products; our service reliability; the ancillary services we provide to our customers, such as business reviews and menu analysis; and our multi-regional presence in North America and Europe, combined with a large geographical footprint of multi-temperature warehouses, which mitigates some of the impact of regional economic declines that may occur over time.

Government Regulation

Our company is required to comply, and it is our policy to comply, with all applicable laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business.

In the U.S., as a marketer and distributor of food products, we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA regulates food safety and quality through various statutory and regulatory mandates, including manufacturing and holding requirements for foods through good manufacturing practice regulations, hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) requirements for certain foods, and the food and color additive approval process. The agency also specifies the standards of identity for certain foods, prescribes the format and content of information required to appear on food product labels, regulates food contact packaging and materials, and maintains a Reportable Food Registry for the industry to report when there is a reasonable probability that an article of food will cause serious adverse health consequences. For certain product lines, we are also subject to the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products Inspection Act, the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act, the Packers and Stockyard Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to interpret and implement these statutory 

6

provisions. The USDA imposes standards for product safety, quality and sanitation through the federal meat and poultry inspection program. The USDA reviews and approves the labeling of these products and also establishes standards for the grading and commercial acceptance of produce shipments from our suppliers. We are also subject to the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, which imposes certain registration and record keeping requirements on facilities that manufacture, process, pack or hold food for human or animal consumption, as well as Food Defense, which is a responsibility of the Department of Homeland Security.

The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has significantly expanded our food safety requirements. We have established and continue to maintain comprehensive, prevention-based controls across the food supply chain that are both verified and validated, as required by FDA regulations implementing FSMA. The FSMA further imposes requirements for food products imported into the U.S. and provides the FDA with mandatory recall authority. 

We and our products are also subject to state and local regulation through such measures as the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state and local health agencies of state and local standards for our products; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are subject to regulations issued pursuant to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Act by the U.S. Department of Labor. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing, health and safety standards to protect our employees from accidents and to establish hazard communication programs to transmit information on the hazards of certain chemicals present in products we distribute. We are also subject to the National Labor Relations Act, which governs the process for collective bargaining between employers and employees and protects the rights of both employers and employees in the workplace.

Our processing and distribution facilities must be registered with the FDA biennially and are subject to periodic government agency inspections by the FDA and USDA. Our facilities are generally inspected at least annually by federal and/or state authorities. We also must establish communication programs to transmit information about the hazards of certain chemicals present in some of the products we distribute.

Our customers include several departments of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs facilities, as well as certain state and local entities. These customer relationships subject us to additional regulations applicable to government contractors.

We are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory agencies, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Department of Labor, which sets employment practice standards for workers, and the U.S. Department of Transportation, as well as its agencies, the Surface Transportation Board, the Federal Highway Administration, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which collectively regulate our trucking operations through the regulation of operations, safety, insurance and hazardous materials. We must comply with the safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of service. Such matters as weight and dimension of equipment also fall under federal and state regulations. We are subject to regulations of the Federal Aviation Administration covering items transported by air. In addition, we are subject to the U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state statutes, which prohibit the submission of claims for payment to the government that are false and the knowing retention of overpayments.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits bribery of public officials to obtain or retain business in foreign jurisdictions. The FCPA also requires us to keep accurate books and records and to maintain internal accounting controls to detect and prevent bribery and to ensure that transactions are properly authorized and recorded. We have implemented and continue to develop a robust anti-corruption compliance program applicable to our global operations to detect and prevent bribery and to comply with these and other anti-corruption laws in countries where we operate.

Our business is subject to competition laws in the various jurisdictions where we operate, including the Sherman Antitrust Act and related federal and state antitrust laws in the U.S. These laws and regulations generally prohibit competitors from fixing prices, boycotting competitors, or engaging in other conduct that unreasonably restrains competition. In many jurisdictions, compliance with these competition laws is of special importance to us, and our operations may come under special scrutiny by competition law authorities, due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions.

Outside the U.S., our business is subject to numerous similar statutes and regulations, as well as other legal and regulatory requirements. For example, we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements of the European Union (the EU), as well as those of EU countries where we conduct business (including Ireland, France and Sweden), which requirements relate to, among other things, competition, product composition, packaging, labeling, advertisement (including nutrition and health claims) and the safety of food products, as well as the health, safety and working conditions of employees. We are subject to privacy laws in the EU, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which requires companies to meet certain 

7

requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition, our business is subject to the U.K. Modern Slavery Act 2015, which requires certain companies that operate in the U.K. to prepare a report describing steps that they have taken to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in their supply chain or business. Our business is also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, an anti-corruption law that criminalizes the failure by a company to prevent persons associated with that company from offering or paying bribes to government officials or non-government persons in order to obtain or retain business or a business advantage for the company, as well as restricting the offer, payment or receipt of bribes to or from governmental officials and non-governmental persons.

All of our company’s facilities and other operations in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world are subject to various environmental protection statutes and regulations, including those in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, relating to: (1) the use of water resources and the discharge of wastewater; (2) the discharge of pollutants into the air, including vehicle emissions; (3) proper handling, treatment and disposing of solid and hazardous wastes; and (4) protecting against and appropriately investigating and remediating spills and releases. Further, most of our distribution facilities have ammonia-based refrigeration systems and tanks for the storage of diesel fuel and other petroleum products which are subject to laws regulating such systems and storage tanks (including the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination associated with the use of underground storage tanks). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Business and Operational Risks - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and we may be subject to substantial fines, penalties, or third-party claims for non-compliance.”

General

We have numerous trademarks that are of significant importance, including the SYSCO® and Brakes® trademarks, in addition to our privately branded product trademarks that include these trademarks. Five of our private brands have had annual sales in excess of $1 billion. These trademarks and the private brands on which they are used are widely recognized within the foodservice industry. Both our U.S. and European trademarks are effective for a ten-year period, and we generally renew our trademarks before their expiration dates unless a particular trademark is no longer in use. We believe the loss of the SYSCO® trademark would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We do not have any material patents or licenses.

We are not engaged in material research and development activities relating to the development of new products or the improvement of existing products.

Our sales do not generally fluctuate significantly on a seasonal basis; therefore, our business is not deemed to be seasonal.

As of July 3, 2021, we operated 343 distribution facilities throughout North America and Europe.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
