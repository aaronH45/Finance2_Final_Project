ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Interest Rate Risk

Our primary market risk exposure is increasing LIBOR-based interest rates. Interest rate derivatives may be used to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt, when appropriate, based on market conditions. 

We had $2.8 billion of variable rate vehicle floorplan payable at December 31, 2020, and $3.6 billion at December 31, 2019. Based on these amounts, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change of $27.6 million in 2020 and $35.8 million in 2019 to our annual floorplan interest expense. Our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to total vehicle floorplan payable is partially mitigated by manufacturers’ floorplan assistance, which in some cases is based on variable interest rates.

We had no commercial paper notes outstanding at December 31, 2020, and $170.0 million at December 31, 2019. Based on the amount outstanding, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in an approximate change to our annual interest expense of $1.7 million in 2019.

Our fixed rate long-term debt, consisting of amounts outstanding under senior unsecured notes and finance lease and other debt obligations, totaled $2.1 billion and had a fair value of $2.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, and totaled $1.9 billion and had a fair value of $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2019.

Equity Price Risk

We are subject to equity price risk with respect to our minority equity investment in Vroom Inc., which has a readily determinable fair value following Vroom’s initial public offering in the second quarter of 2020. During the period that we hold this equity investment, gains and losses will be recorded as the fair market value of this security changes over time. The fair value of our equity investment was $101.9 million at December 31, 2020. A hypothetical 10% change in the equity price of this security would result in an approximate change to gain or loss of $10.2 million. The selected 10% hypothetical change in the equity price is not intended to reflect a best or worst case scenario, as equity price changes could be smaller or larger due to the nature of equity markets.
