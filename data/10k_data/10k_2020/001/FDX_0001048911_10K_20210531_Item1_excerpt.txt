PART I 

ITEM 1. BUSINESS  

Overview  

FedEx Corporation (“FedEx”) was incorporated in Delaware on October 2, 1997 to serve as the parent holding company and provide strategic direction to the FedEx portfolio of companies. FedEx provides a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce and business services through operating companies competing collectively, operating collaboratively and innovating digitally, under the respected FedEx brand. These companies are included in the following reportable business segments:  

•  

FedEx Express: Federal Express Corporation (“FedEx Express”) is the world’s largest express transportation company, offering time-definite delivery to more than 220 countries and territories, connecting markets that comprise more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product.  

•  

FedEx Ground: FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. (“FedEx Ground”) is a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services. FedEx Ground provides low-cost, day-certain service to any business address in the U.S. and Canada, as well as residential delivery to 100% of U.S. residences through its FedEx Home Delivery service. FedEx Ground Economy specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages.  

•  

FedEx Freight: FedEx Freight Corporation (“FedEx Freight”) is a leading North American provider of less-than-truckload (“LTL”) freight services across all lengths of haul to businesses and residences. Within the contiguous U.S., FedEx Freight offers FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of heavy, bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. FedEx Freight also offers freight delivery service to most points in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  

•  

FedEx Services: FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. (“FedEx Services”) provides sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that support our operating segments.  

The FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. (“FedEx Office”) operating segment provides document and business services and retail access to our package transportation businesses. Additionally, the FedEx Logistics, Inc. (“FedEx Logistics”) operating segment provides customs brokerage and global ocean and air freight forwarding through FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage, Inc. (“FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage”) and integrated supply chain management solutions through FedEx Supply Chain Distribution System, Inc. (“FedEx Supply Chain”). FedEx Office and FedEx Logistics are included in “Corporate, other and eliminations” in our segment reporting.

The coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to have a profound impact on our industry. As an essential business, FedEx has kept the world’s healthcare, industrial and at-home supply chains moving while maintaining the safety of our team members, our customers and the communities in which we operate as our top priority.

Strategy  

At FedEx, we are building “the network for what’s next.” Our new strategic operating principles unveiled during 2021, “compete collectively, operate collaboratively, innovate digitally,” guide how we grow, execute and evolve as a company and help differentiate FedEx from our competitors. 

The collective FedEx brand unites our distinct operating companies, giving us our competitive edge. Further, our strategy allows us to manage our business as a portfolio, in the long-term best interest of the enterprise. As a result, we base decisions on capital investment, expansion of delivery, information technology and retail networks, and service additions or enhancements upon achieving the highest overall long-term return on capital for our business as a whole. For each FedEx operating company, we focus on making appropriate investments in the technology and assets necessary to optimize our long-term earnings performance and cash flow. Our business strategy also provides flexibility in sizing our operating companies to align with varying macroeconomic conditions and customer demand for the market segments in which they operate, allowing us to leverage and manage change. Volatility, uncertainty and evolution have become the norms in the global transportation market, and we are able to use our flexibility to accommodate changing conditions in the global economy, including the continued growth of e-commerce. To that end, we continue to modernize our aircraft fleet with more fuel efficient and lower-emission aircraft, expand our operations at FedEx Ground where we continue to see growing package volumes, realign our systems and develop innovative service offerings. 

While we believe that operating independent networks, each focused on its own respective markets, enhances service quality and reliability from each business unit, we are building a holistic, collaborative approach to compete in a dynamic and ever-changing market. By operating collaboratively, we help ensure that we have the right package in the right network and at the right cost-to-serve. For example, last-mile optimization, the delivery of certain U.S. day-definite FedEx Express packages by FedEx Ground, allows us to increase efficiency and lower our cost-to-serve. Additionally, FedEx Freight is providing road and intermodal support for both FedEx Ground and FedEx Express, and FedEx Express is working with FedEx Logistics to secure air charters for U.S. customers. 

Innovation inspired our start at FedEx nearly 50 years ago, and it is fueling our future. The size and scale of our network gives us key insights into global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, increase visibility and improve the customer experience. To fully harness the power of this data, during 2021 we launched FedEx Dataworks, a new organization focused on putting our data into context and using it to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. We are also increasing capabilities and products through sensor-based technologies and providing enhanced visibility and predictive capabilities. See “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology” below for more information on FedEx SenseAware ID, FedEx Surround and other FedEx innovations. 

At FedEx, “Safety Above All” is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. We are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers and the public. This philosophy is embedded in our day-to-day work through rigorous policies, continual education and engagement and investments in technology designed to prevent accidents. 

Additionally, by focusing on the following three key areas, we believe we will continue to uniquely position FedEx for long-term success: 

•  

E-commerce: The acceleration of trends experienced in 2021 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the importance of our ongoing strategic e-commerce initiatives, which include FedEx Ground seven-day-per-week residential U.S delivery coverage; investing in technologies to optimize last-mile deliveries; expanding capabilities to better handle large items; offering FedEx Freight Direct, the first FedEx-branded through-the-door service; and accelerating the expansion of our retail convenience network. 

•  

Operational Excellence: Our competitive advantage in the marketplace is fueled by a keen focus on operational excellence and customer service. We are strategically focused on efficiency and continued investments in people, capacity and technology to optimize our networks. 

•  

Digital Innovation: We are reimagining our digital capabilities and infrastructure in a manner that we believe will deliver enhanced customer experiences that are simple, personal and proactive. Additionally, we are continually investing in automation and other technologies to safely, efficiently and sustainably handle the growing volume of shipments that flow through our network each day. 

- 4 - 

Through our global transportation, information technology and retail networks, we help to facilitate an ongoing and unprecedented expansion of customer access — to goods, services and information. We believe it would be extremely difficult, costly and time-consuming to replicate our global network, which reflects decades of investment, innovation and expertise, includes the world’s largest all-cargo air fleet and connects more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product. We continue to position our companies and team members to facilitate and capitalize on this access and to achieve stronger long-term growth, productivity and profitability.  

During 2021 and early 2022, we have introduced a number of innovative solutions, advanced important long-term business initiatives and made other important investments that benefit our customers, team members and communities, including:  

•  

Delivering COVID-19 vaccines, critical personal protective equipment and medical supplies, and providing other transportation and logistics support to humanitarian relief agencies as they respond to the pandemic. 

•  

Committing to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040 and helping establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture to advance sequestration solutions. 

•  

Launching FedEx Dataworks and acquiring ShopRunner, Inc. (“ShopRunner”), an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers. Additionally, we announced a new multi-year collaboration with Adobe, starting with the integration of ShopRunner with Adobe Commerce’s Magento platform, which we expect will be available to Adobe merchants in late calendar 2021. 

•  

Introducing new technologies such as SenseAware ID, a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that provides real-time updates on a package’s location within the FedEx Express network, and exploring the use of autonomous technologies with ongoing testing of Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, and a multi-year, multi-phase agreement to test Nuro’s next-generation autonomous vehicle technology. 

•  

Further collaborating between operating companies through last-mile optimization with FedEx Express and FedEx Ground, which has expanded to more than 60 markets across the U.S., and other initiatives. 

•  

Expanding FedEx Ground seven-day-per-week residential delivery coverage to virtually all of the U.S. population. 

•  

Finalizing the rollout of dynamic route optimization technology at FedEx Ground, which provides service providers near real-time data to plan efficient delivery routes. 

•  

Completing the integration of FedEx Ground Economy (formerly FedEx SmartPost) packages previously given to the U.S. Postal Service (“USPS”) into FedEx Ground standard operations. 

•  

Adding new and expanded facilities and automation solutions to optimize FedEx Ground network capacity. 

•  

Strengthening the FedEx Express international business by completing the integration of the FedEx Express and TNT Express linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations and introducing enhanced Europe-to-the-U.S. overnight and European e-commerce services with FedEx International Priority Express and FedEx International Connect Plus. 

•  

Continuing to grow our retail convenience network and digital e-commerce business, with significantly increased customer usage of our FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology offerings. 

•  

Establishing a Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DEI”) Depot, an online platform to create more awareness of DEI-related resources, events and team member stories across operating companies. 

Reputation and Responsibility  

By competing collectively under the FedEx brand, our operating companies benefit from one of the world’s most recognized brands. FedEx is one of the most trusted and respected companies in the world, and the FedEx brand name is a powerful sales and marketing tool. Among the many reputation awards we received during 2021, FedEx ranked 16th in FORTUNE magazine’s “World’s Most Admired Companies” list — the 21st consecutive year FedEx has ranked among the top 20 in the FORTUNE Most Admired Companies list, with 15 of those years ranking among the top 10. During 2021 FedEx was also named one of the “TIME100 Most Influential Companies” by Time magazine and was recognized as the biggest transportation and logistics company in the world by Forbes. Additionally, FedEx was named one of “America’s Most Responsible Companies” by Newsweek in 2021, ranking higher than any other “Travel, Transport & Logistics” company included on the list.  

Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, FedEx is widely acknowledged as a great place to work. For example, FedEx was listed as one of “America’s Best Large Employers” and one of “America’s Best Employers for Diversity” by Forbes in 2021.

Through our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategies, FedEx connects the communities where we live and work in remarkable ways. Our 2021 ESG Report is available at fedex.com/en-us/sustainability/reports.html. This report discusses our ESG strategies and programs and includes important goals and metrics that demonstrate our commitment to fulfilling our responsibilities in these areas. Information in our ESG Report is not incorporated by reference in, and does not form part of, this Annual Report. 

Human Resource Management 

Our Culture 

At FedEx, it is our people—our greatest asset—that give us our strong reputation and stand at the heart of our success. In addition to our superior physical and information networks, FedEx has an exemplary human network. Across the globe, our 570,000 team members are united by our passion to deliver the FedEx Purple Promise—to make every FedEx experience outstanding—and our People–Service–Profit principles.  

Our success depends on the talent, dedication and well-being of our people. As we grow, we strive to recruit, retain, develop and provide advancement opportunities for our team members. We continually work to make FedEx an inclusive, equitable and growth-focused workplace where all team members have the opportunity to flourish. 

Safety 

Our longstanding “Safety Above All” philosophy is the first and foremost value in every aspect of our business. It is backed by strict policies, robust team member education, safety recognition awards and continued investment in technology. Across the enterprise, we are committed to making our workplaces and communities safer for our team members, customers and the public. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented numerous measures to keep our team members, customers and communities safe while on the front lines operating in impacted areas and providing connectivity and delivery of critical medical supplies around the world.  

Diversity, Equity & Inclusion 

We believe that DEI delivers a better future for all team members, customers, suppliers and communities. As a global company, we see exceptional business and community value in the diversity of perspectives and experiences that our team members bring to work every day. While we are proud of what we have achieved during our almost 50-year history, we know that DEI must always be at the forefront of our business strategy.  

The FedEx workforce is as diverse as the world we serve, and we believe that everyone deserves respect. We are committed to be a diverse, equitable and inclusive employer. This year, we added the word equity to the title of our enterprise-wide efforts, formalizing our commitment to creating a workplace where everyone has fair treatment and equal opportunity to succeed. We also established four consistent, strategic pillars across our enterprise to frame our DEI work and share our progress: Our People; Our Education and Engagement; Our Communities, Customers, and Suppliers; and Our Story. While we provide a consistent framework for DEI, each operating company structures and operationalizes its approach separately to account for regional differences in regulations and cultures. 

Compensation and Benefits  

We provide our team members with competitive healthcare, wellness and other benefits to support their quality of life and enable them to thrive in the workplace. In addition, we offer competitive retirement benefits to eligible U.S. team members.  

We conduct periodic benchmarking analyses to ensure our pay remains competitive. In addition, FedEx regularly assesses internal pay equity. In each pay analysis, we adjust for job tenure, region, performance and other variables that can influence pay over time. 

All eligible full-time and part-time employees and their eligible dependents receive competitive health benefits. In the U.S., we cover approximately 70% of total eligible health and disability costs for part- and full-time employees at the plan level for our approximately 219,000 participating employees.  

- 6 - 

The COVID-19 pandemic took an unprecedented toll on the emotional and mental welfare of many. To support team members’ mental health, we offer 24/7 confidential counseling services to employees, eligible dependents and all household members, even if they are not participating plan members. We frequently communicate with employees on how to access these resources to promote their use across the enterprise, with an increased focus on mental health resources this year. 

Learning and Development 

As our team members commit to delivering the Purple Promise, we remain committed to providing all our people with learning and development opportunities to advance their careers at FedEx. Training and development begins with our enterprise-wide content for new employees—Core New Employee Orientation—which provides a consistent onboarding experience across our operating companies on topics such as safety, security, compliance, sustainability and DEI. Beyond training opportunities, we provide ongoing career development tools, opportunities and education for all full-time employees. Each operating company designs and manages its own leadership and development programs in support of its unique needs.  

We are committed to supporting team members who wish to pursue higher education in a variety of ways. In 2020, we provided over $15 million in tuition assistance to nearly 10,000 employees to further their education. In addition, Learning inspired by FedEx (LiFE)—a partnership between multiple FedEx operating companies and The University of Memphis—allows many employees the opportunity to earn a tuition-free, fully online degree. Eligible employees include all U.S.-based FedEx Logistics and FedEx Trade Networks Transport & Brokerage employees, all Memphis-based FedEx Supply Chain employees and FedEx Express employees at 16 major hub locations in the U.S.  

Employee Engagement 

We value feedback from our team members, looking to understand their concerns and expectations and, where possible, acting on them. We provide several avenues to listen to and engage with our team, including annual surveys, employee networks and direct feedback. FedEx conducts annual engagement surveys to measure employee satisfaction on Culture, Engagement and Diversity and we share the results with senior leaders to inform leadership development plans and additional changes as needed.  

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our team members moved to remote work settings. We are reevaluating how and where team members work to provide flexibility, increase effectiveness and optimize our workspaces. 

Tenure, Promotion and Turnover 

Every day, we work hard to earn and maintain the loyalty of our team members by creating a workplace culture that supports their aspirations and provides benefits and opportunities to support their quality of life and development. Globally, FedEx hired more than 300,000 full- and part-time team members in 2020. Excluding TNT Express employees and U.S.-based FedEx Supply Chain employees, in 2021 turnover for part-time team members, primarily package handlers, was 183%, while full-time team member turnover was 23%. 

Our Community  

FedEx is committed to actively supporting the communities we serve worldwide through the strategic investment of our people, resources and network. FedEx Cares, our global community engagement program, is one way we work to connect people and possibilities. We provide financial contributions, in-kind charitable shipping services and team member volunteering to help non-profit organizations achieve their goals and make a measurable impact on the world. We focus our effort in the following three areas:  

•  

Delivering for Good: Lending our global network and our unparalleled logistics expertise to organizations with mission-critical needs and helping communities before, during and after crises.  

•  

Global Entrepreneurship: Advancing women and minority-owned small businesses globally through training and increased access to resources, capital and new markets. 

•  

Sustainable Logistics: Helping scale existing solutions and investing in new ideas to improve mobility, reduce congestion and decrease pollution in communities around the world.  

In 2020 we launched FedEx Cares 50 by 50 with the goal of positively impacting 50 million people around the world by our 50th anniversary in 2023. FedEx also supports communities throughout the U.S. with its annual FedEx Cares United Way giving campaign. For additional information on our community involvement and our FedEx Cares strategy, visit fedexcares.com. 

- 7 - 

We remain committed to helping lift local economies by investing in people and communities where we live and work. In the U.S., this includes seeking diverse suppliers and strengthening our supply chain by sourcing from small, minority- and women-owned businesses. We are also proud of our long-standing history of supporting and fostering relationships with organizations that are working to make our society more equitable and just, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Civil Rights Museum. In 2021 we announced the launch of the FedEx E-Commerce Learning Lab, which is designed to help diverse small business owners looking to develop or expand their e-commerce operations, with a focus on women and entrepreneurs of color. 

The Environment  

At FedEx, we remain steadfast in our commitment to minimize the impacts our business has on the environment. In March 2021 we announced our goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our global operations by calendar 2040. To help reach this goal, we are designating more than $2.0 billion of initial investment in vehicle electrification, sustainable energy and carbon sequestration, including a pledge of $100 million to Yale University to help establish the Yale Center for Natural Carbon Capture.  

Our “Practical Sustainability” philosophy and “Reduce, Replace, Revolutionize” approach guide our environmental strategy across three key areas of our environmental footprint: our aviation fleet, our vehicle fleet and our facilities. Throughout FedEx, team members are encouraged to implement our sustainability strategy and achieve our goals. We equip team members with a variety of internal programs to advance our progress in reducing fuel emissions, energy use and waste in the workplace. 

To reduce the cost of fuel use and associated greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, we are replacing many of our older airplanes with more fuel-efficient models, and we have implemented efficiencies in flight operations through our global FedEx Fuel Sense program. These two initiatives saved more than 255 million gallons of jet fuel and avoided more than 2.0 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions in 2020. A global increase in volume exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the retirement of certain older aircraft and led us to fall short of our goal to reduce aircraft emissions intensity by 30% from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2020. However, in 2020, we achieved a 27% reduction in aircraft emissions intensity since 2005 through a combination of our aircraft fleet modernization and operational programs. We have also established a goal of obtaining 30% of our jet fuel from alternative fuels by calendar 2030.  

We strive to employ the most advanced vehicle technologies to efficiently and safely move packages across our networks. FedEx Express has established a goal to increase vehicle fuel efficiency by 50% from a 2005 baseline by calendar 2025. Through 2020, our efforts collectively resulted in a 45% improvement in FedEx Express vehicle fuel efficiency from our 2005 baseline.  

We have an impressive global alternative fuel fleet with nearly 4,100 alternative fuel vehicles, including hybrid, electric, liquified or compressed natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. In 2021 FedEx Express agreed to purchase 500 electric vehicles from General Motors’ BrightDrop, and we recently conducted several successful initiatives involving electric vehicles in our operations. We plan to transition the entire FedEx parcel pickup-and-delivery fleet to zero-emission electric vehicles by calendar 2040, using a phased approach to replace existing vehicles. For example, by calendar 2025, we expect 50% of FedEx Express global pickup-and-delivery vehicle purchases will be electric, rising to 100% of all purchases by calendar 2030, subject to availability. We are developing innovative charging infrastructures to support the continued rollout of our electric vehicle fleet, and across our operating companies we continue to electrify our forklift, airport ground service equipment and other non-road vehicles.  

Our zero-emission FedEx SameDay Bot and pilot drone delivery service, which are discussed in more detail below under “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology,” have potential to serve as environmentally friendly alternatives for last-mile residential package deliveries. We also continue to leverage the efficiency of intermodal rail transport for long-haul shipping at FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight, and promote the use of electric vehicles and alternative fuels by independent service providers in our shipping network. Additionally, we are working with manufacturers to test and pilot zero-emission vehicle technology for long-haul trucks, and strive to implement the optimal technology and drive operational efficiency across our long-haul fleet. 

The efficient operation of our more than 5,000 air and ground hubs, local stations, freight service centers and retail locations is critical to achieving our business and sustainability goals. Where appropriate, we adopt the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (“LEED”) standard in the U.S. and the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (“BREEAM”) in Europe to guide efficient facility design and construction of state-of-the-art facilities. FedEx Express has committed to seek LEED or BREEAM certification on all new U.S. and European FedEx Express buildings where appropriate. FedEx has 32 LEED-certified facilities across all of our operating companies. At the end of 2020, approximately 450 FedEx facilities were certified to the ISO 14001 environmental management system standard.  

As part of our goal to become carbon neutral by calendar 2040, we are advancing on-site renewable energy generation and procuring renewable energy to help us to continue reducing our GHG footprint. Across our operating companies, 26 FedEx locations generate on-site renewable energy, and we are evaluating opportunities to purchase off-site renewable energy. 

- 8 - 

We also work to optimize packaging, including through reusable options, reduce packaging waste and maximize recycling to make the best use of our resources, reduce emissions and ship packages more efficiently. FedEx Office carefully manages the responsible sourcing, use and recycling of paper used for commercial copy and print services. During 2020, 99.8% of all paper purchased by FedEx Office was third-party certified. Our operating companies are optimizing their recycling programs through close collaboration with their waste management vendors. We are also working with our customers to reduce packaging materials to decrease their waste management costs. 

For additional information on the ways we are minimizing our impact on the environment, see fedex.com/en-us/sustainability.html.  

Governance  

The FedEx Board of Directors is comprised of a majority of independent directors and is committed to the highest quality corporate governance and accountability to stockholders. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews all aspects of our governance policies and practices, including our Corporate Governance Guidelines (the “Guidelines”) and our Code of Conduct, in light of best practices and makes whatever changes it deems appropriate to further our longstanding commitment to the highest standards of corporate governance. The Guidelines and the Code of Conduct, which apply to all of our directors, officers and employees, including our principal executive officer and senior financial officers, are available under the ESG heading on the Investor Relations page of our website at investors.fedex.com. We will post under the ESG heading on the Investor Relations page of our website information regarding any amendment to, or waiver from, the provisions of the Code of Conduct to the extent such disclosure is required.  

Business Segments  

The following describes in more detail the operations of each of our principal operating segments:  

FedEx Express Segment  

FedEx Express  

Overview  

FedEx Express invented express distribution nearly 50 years ago in 1973 and remains the industry leader, providing rapid, reliable, time-definite delivery of packages and freight to more than 220 countries and territories through an integrated global network. In 2016, we acquired TNT Express, a leading international express transportation, small-package ground delivery and freight transportation company. 

FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight, connecting markets that generate more than 99% of the world’s gross domestic product through door-to-door, customs-cleared service, historically with a money-back guarantee. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020 we temporarily suspended our money-back guarantee for all FedEx Express services. In April 2021 we reinstated the money-back guarantee for select FedEx Express U.S. domestic and U.S. import/export services. However, as of July 15, 2021, the money-back guarantee remains suspended for other FedEx Express services as we continue to experience unprecedented volume and customer demand as well as limited aircraft capacity. FedEx Express’s unmatched air route authorities and extensive transportation infrastructure, combined with leading-edge information technologies, make it the world’s largest express transportation company. As of May 31, 2021, FedEx Express employed approximately 289,000 employees and had approximately 77,000 drop-off locations (including FedEx Office stores and FedEx OnSite locations, such as approximately 18,000 Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons stores), 684 aircraft and approximately 87,000 vehicles in its global network. 

FedEx Express also provides time-critical shipment services through FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. (“FedEx Custom Critical”) and cross-border enablement and technology solutions and e-commerce transportation solutions through FedEx Cross Border Holdings, Inc. (“FedEx Cross Border”) and its subsidiary FedEx Cross Border (UK) Limited (formerly P2P Mailing Limited). 

Services  

FedEx Express offers a wide range of U.S. domestic and international shipping services for delivery of packages and freight. FedEx Express offers three U.S. domestic overnight package delivery services: FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority Overnight and FedEx Standard Overnight. FedEx SameDay service is available 365 days a year throughout all 50 states for urgent shipments up to 150 pounds. FedEx Express also offers U.S. express overnight and deferred freight services to handle the needs of the time-definite freight market.  

- 9 - 

International express and deferred package delivery is available to more than 220 countries and territories, with a variety of time-definite services to meet distinct customer needs. FedEx International Economy provides time-definite delivery typically in two to five business days. FedEx International First provides time-definite delivery to select postal codes in more than 25 countries and territories, with delivery to select U.S. ZIP Codes as early as 8:00 a.m. from nearly 200 countries and territories in one or two business days, delivery by 10:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Canada and by 11:00 a.m. in one business day from the U.S. to Mexico. FedEx Express also offers domestic pickup-and-delivery services within certain non-U.S. countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, Italy, Canada, Mexico, Poland, India, China and South Africa. In addition, FedEx Express offers comprehensive international express and deferred freight services, real-time tracking and advanced customs clearance. 

In 2021 we introduced new service offerings to enhance our international portfolio. Our enhanced FedEx International Priority service provides end-of-day time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 220 countries and territories, and our FedEx International Priority Express service provides midday time-definite delivery in one to three business days to more than 20 countries and territories. Additionally, FedEx International Connect Plus, a contractual e-commerce service currently available from ten origin countries to 25 destination countries, provides day-definite delivery typically within two to five business days. 

We are currently in the process of migrating customers from services offered by TNT Express to the FedEx Express portfolio of services. 

For information regarding FedEx Express e-commerce tools and solutions, such as FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology.”  

International Expansion  

Over the years, acquisitions have given us more robust global transportation networks and added capabilities in important international markets. In 2016 we acquired TNT Express, which is the largest acquisition in FedEx history. This acquisition rapidly accelerates our European and global growth, substantially enhances our global footprint through TNT Express’s lower-cost road networks in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, and expands our capabilities and solutions for our customers. During 2020 we substantially completed projects across our European hub and station locations that allow interoperability between the ground networks for both FedEx Express and TNT Express packages. In 2021 we completed the integration of the FedEx Express and TNT Express linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations and began offering an enhanced portfolio of international services. We expect to complete the final phase of international air network interoperability in early calendar 2022.  

As we approach the completion of the physical network integration of TNT Express in 2022, we continue to execute initiatives in addition to the integration to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. For more information about the integration of TNT Express, our international strategy and related costs, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report. During 2021 we also enhanced our Europe-to-the-U.S. overnight and European e-commerce service portfolio with FedEx International Priority Express and FedEx International Connect Plus, which are discussed above under “Services.” 

We also have expanded our capabilities in the Asia-Pacific markets, including through the establishment of: our Asia-Pacific hub at the Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport in southern China, which began operations in 2009; our North Pacific regional hub at the Kansai International Airport in Osaka, Japan, which opened in 2014 and serves as a consolidation point for shipments from northern Asia to the U.S.; and our International Express and Cargo Hub in Shanghai, which opened in 2018 at Shanghai’s Pudong International Airport. During 2020, we added 14 new Asia-Pacific origin markets for FedEx International First service to the U.S. and Canada. These developments allow us to continue to better serve our global customers doing business in the Asia-Pacific markets.  

To facilitate the use of our growing international network, we offer a full range of international trade consulting services and a variety of online tools that enable customers to more easily determine and comply with international shipping requirements.  

U.S. Postal Service Agreement  

In 2013, FedEx Express entered into a new seven-year agreement with the USPS under which FedEx Express provides airport-to-airport transportation of USPS First Class Mail, Priority Mail Express and Priority Mail within the U.S. In 2017, the parties entered into an amendment to the agreement whereby the initial renewal period provided in the agreement was exercised in part and the agreement’s period of performance was extended through September 29, 2024. FedEx Express also provides transportation and delivery for the USPS’s international delivery service called Global Express Guaranteed under a separate agreement. For more information about our relationship with the USPS, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.

Pricing  

FedEx Express periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guides. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 4, 2021, FedEx Express implemented a 4.9% average list price increase for U.S. domestic, U.S. export and U.S. import services.  

In order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, between April 6, 2020 and November 1, 2020 FedEx Express implemented temporary surcharges on all international package and airfreight shipments. These surcharges continued as peak surcharges beginning November 2, 2020 and remain in effect. Additionally, beginning June 8, 2020 FedEx Express has implemented a series of peak surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized or require additional handling, and to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher surcharges applied during the 2021 holiday peak season. Effective January 18, 2021, FedEx Express made general changes to the surcharge criteria for certain packages that require additional handling and for packages that are picked up from or delivered to remote and less accessible locations. 

FedEx Express has an indexed fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic and U.S. outbound shipments and for shipments originating internationally, where legally and contractually possible. FedEx Express fuel surcharges are adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. Some FedEx Express international fuel surcharges incorporate a timing lag of approximately six to eight weeks. On June 21, 2021, we updated the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at FedEx Express. Beginning February 1, 2021, the fuel surcharge for U.S. domestic freight services is assessed per pound of shipment. The weighted-average U.S. domestic and outbound fuel surcharges for the past three years were: 2021 — 4.9%; 2020 — 6.3%; and 2019 — 7.5%. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for a description and discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.  

Operations  

FedEx Express’s primary sorting facility, located in Memphis, serves as the center of the company’s multiple hub-and-spoke system. A second national hub facility is located in Indianapolis. We are making investments over multiple years in our facilities of approximately $1.5 billion to significantly expand the Indianapolis hub and approximately $1.5 billion to modernize the Memphis World Hub. In addition to these national hubs, FedEx Express operates regional hubs in Fort Worth, Newark, Oakland and Greensboro and major metropolitan sorting facilities in Chicago and Los Angeles.  

Facilities in Anchorage, Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou and Osaka serve as sorting facilities for express package and freight traffic moving to and from Asia, Europe and North America. Additional major sorting and freight handling facilities are located at Narita Airport in Tokyo and Stansted Airport outside London. The facilities in Paris, Cologne, Guangzhou and Osaka are also designed to serve as regional hubs for their respective market areas. A facility in Miami — the Miami Gateway Hub — serves our South Florida, Latin American and Caribbean markets. TNT Express operates a central air hub near Liege, Belgium. 

In addition to its worldwide air network, FedEx Express operates road networks in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Australia and South America. FedEx Express’s unique European road network, harnessing the integration of TNT Express, connects more than 40 countries through 34 road hubs and over 570 direct served stations.  

Throughout its worldwide network, FedEx Express operates city stations and employs a staff of customer service agents, cargo handlers and couriers who pick up and deliver shipments in the station’s service area. In some international areas, independent agents (“Global Service Participants”) have been selected to complete deliveries and to pick up packages. For more information about our sorting and handling facilities, see “Item 2. Properties” of this Annual Report under the caption “FedEx Express Segment.” 

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Express shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Express also has alliances with certain other retailers to provide in-store drop-off sites, including at more than 18,000 Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons stores. Our unstaffed FedEx Drop Boxes provide customers the opportunity to drop off packages in office buildings, shopping centers and corporate or industrial parks. 

Fuel Supplies and Costs  

During 2021, FedEx Express purchased jet fuel from various suppliers under contracts that vary in length and which provide for estimated amounts of fuel to be delivered. The fuel represented by these contracts is purchased at market prices. We do not have any jet fuel hedging contracts. See “Pricing” above.  

- 11 - 

The following table sets forth FedEx Express’s costs for jet fuel and its percentage of FedEx Corporation consolidated revenues for the last five fiscal years (amounts include TNT Express):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Most of FedEx Express’s vehicle fuel needs are satisfied by retail purchases with various discounts.  

Competition  

As described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report, the express package and freight markets are both highly competitive and sensitive to price and service, especially in periods of little or no macroeconomic growth. The ability to compete effectively depends upon price, frequency, capacity and speed of scheduled service, ability to track packages, extent of geographic coverage, reliability, innovative service offerings and the fit within the customer’s overall supply chain.  

Competitors within the U.S. include other package delivery concerns, principally United Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”), passenger airlines offering express package services, regional delivery companies, air freight forwarders and the USPS. FedEx Express’s principal international competitors are DHL, UPS, DPD (a subsidiary of France’s La Poste’s GeoPost), General Logistics Systems (a Royal Mail-owned parcel delivery group), foreign postal authorities, passenger airlines, air freight forwarders, regional carriers, and all-cargo airlines. FedEx Express also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com is investing significant capital to establish a network of hubs, aircraft and vehicles. Many of FedEx Express’s international competitors are government-owned, -controlled or -subsidized carriers, which may have greater resources, lower costs, less profit sensitivity and more favorable operating conditions than FedEx Express.  

Employees  

Donald F. Colleran is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Express, which is headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2021, FedEx Express employed approximately 228,000 permanent full-time and approximately 61,000 permanent part-time employees.  

The pilots of FedEx Express, who are a small number of its total employees, are represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, International (“ALPA”) and are employed under a collective bargaining agreement that took effect in November 2015. The collective bargaining agreement is scheduled to become amendable in November 2021, and bargaining for a successor agreement began in May 2021. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for more information. In addition to our pilots at FedEx Express, certain of FedEx Express’s non-U.S. employees are unionized.  

Attempts by other labor organizations to organize certain other groups of FedEx Express employees occur from time to time. Although these organizing attempts have not resulted in any certification of a U.S. domestic collective bargaining representative of FedEx Express employees (other than ALPA), we cannot predict the outcome of these labor activities or their effect, if any, on FedEx Express or its employees. For more information, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. FedEx Express believes its employee relations are excellent.  

FedEx Custom Critical  

FedEx Custom Critical provides a range of expedited, time-specific freight-shipping services throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Among its services are Surface Expedite, providing exclusive-use shipping and time-definite services; Air Expedite, offering an array of expedited air solutions to meet customers’ critical delivery times; and White Glove Services, for shipments that require extra care in handling, temperature control or specialized security. Service from FedEx Custom Critical is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. FedEx Custom Critical continuously monitors shipments through an integrated proprietary shipment-control system, including two-way satellite communications on exclusive-use shipments.

FedEx Cross Border 

FedEx Cross Border is an e-commerce enabler that provides international cross-border enablement and technology solutions such as duty calculations, package tracking, international shipping costs and currency conversion calculations. Additionally, FedEx Cross Border publishes customs duty and tax information for approximately 200 customs areas worldwide through WorldTariff. The offerings of FedEx Cross Border strategically fit into our global portfolio by allowing us to help retailers and e-tailers reach international e-commerce customers. 

FedEx Ground Segment  

Overview  

By leveraging the FedEx brand, maintaining a low cost structure and efficiently using information technology and advanced automation systems, FedEx Ground continues to enhance its competitive position as a leading provider of business and residential money-back guaranteed ground package delivery services. As of July 15, 2021, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Ground services remains temporarily suspended as we continue to experience unprecedented volume and customer demand. FedEx Ground serves customers in the North American small-package market, focusing on business and residential delivery of packages weighing up to 150 pounds. Ground service is provided to 100% of the continental U.S. population and overnight service of up to 400 miles to nearly 100% of the continental U.S. population. Service is also provided to nearly 100% of the Canadian population. In addition, FedEx Ground offers service to Alaska and Hawaii through a ground and air network operation coordinated with other transportation providers. In 2021 FedEx Ground expanded seven-day-per-week residential delivery coverage to virtually all of the U.S. population. 

FedEx Ground continues to improve the speed, reach and service capabilities of its network by reducing transit time for many of its lanes and introducing and expanding overnight ground service in many metropolitan areas. FedEx Ground’s network expansion has substantially increased the company’s daily pickup capacity through the addition of new hubs featuring the latest automated sorting technology and the expansion or relocation of existing hubs and other facilities. Additionally, FedEx Ground is repurposing former FedEx SmartPost facilities for standard or large package sortation, and adding capacity through new regional sort facilities designed to handle shorter zone volumes into certain markets. FedEx Ground is also making significant operational enhancements to ensure safe and reliable handling of large and heavy items. These changes include designing new facilities, adding equipment to certain facilities and making other operational adjustments.  

The company offers our FedEx Home Delivery service, which reaches 100% of U.S. residences. FedEx Home Delivery is dedicated to meeting the delivery needs of residential customers and provides routine Saturday and evening delivery and premium options such as day-specific, appointment and signature delivery. Sunday delivery is also provided for virtually all of the U.S. population. FedEx Home Delivery brings unmatched services to residential shippers and their customers and is the first residential ground package delivery service to have offered a money-back guarantee. The FedEx Ground Economy (formerly FedEx SmartPost) service specializes in the consolidation and delivery of high volumes of low-weight, less time-sensitive business-to-consumer packages to any residential address or PO Box in the U.S. During 2021 we completed the integration of FedEx Ground Economy packages into the standard FedEx Ground operations, generating last-mile efficiency through increased delivery density. 

Pricing  

FedEx Ground periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its Service Guide. In general, U.S. shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, size, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. Effective January 4, 2021, FedEx Ground and FedEx Home Delivery implemented a 4.9% average list price increase. FedEx Ground Economy average list prices also increased. 

In order to manage demand and capacity constraints in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning June 8, 2020 FedEx Ground implemented a series of surcharges generally applying to shipments that are oversized, unauthorized or require additional handling; to residential packages for customers meeting a certain volume threshold; and to FedEx Ground Economy shipments. Specific applicable surcharges have been adjusted periodically since their implementation, and higher rates applied during the 2021 holiday peak season. Effective January 18, 2021, FedEx Ground made general changes to surcharge criteria for certain packages that require additional handling. 

FedEx Ground has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two weeks prior to the week in which it is assessed. On June 21, 2021, we updated the tables used to determine our fuel surcharges at FedEx Ground. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for a description and discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.

Operations  

FedEx Ground operates a multiple hub-and-spoke sorting and distribution system that consisted of 625 facilities, including 40 hubs, in the U.S. and Canada as of May 31, 2021. FedEx Ground conducts its operations primarily with approximately 96,000 vehicles owned or leased by separate service providers. To provide FedEx Home Delivery service and FedEx Ground Economy service, FedEx Ground leverages its pickup operation and hub and linehaul network. 

Advanced automated unloading and sorting technology is used to streamline the handling of millions of packages daily. FedEx Ground yard management systems, which interact with GPS tags on each trailer and create geofences around FedEx Ground facilities, automatically notify the control center when a trailer arrives and departs. Using overhead laser and six-sided camera-based bar code scan technology, hub conveyors electronically guide packages to their appropriate destination chute, where they are loaded for transport to their respective destination stations for local delivery. Autonomous, driverless technologies enable FedEx Ground to handle large, non-conveyable packages. FedEx Ground is also implementing dynamic scheduling tools to match sort staffing headcount with volumes, and is introducing capabilities to allow certain packages to bypass station sortation and proceed directly to vehicles, which helps to maximize station capacity. 

During 2021 FedEx Ground finalized the rollout of dynamic route optimization technology, which provides service providers near real-time data that can be used to plan efficient delivery routes and make decisions about vehicle mix and workforce to accommodate the volume associated with e-commerce growth. Additionally, software systems and internet-based applications are deployed to offer customers new ways to connect internal package data with external delivery information. FedEx Ground provides shipment tracing and proof-of-delivery signature functionality through the FedEx website, fedex.com. For additional information regarding FedEx Ground e-commerce tools and solutions, including FedEx Delivery Manager and FedEx Returns Technology, see “FedEx Services Segment — Customer-Driven Technology.”  

FedEx Office offers retail access to FedEx Ground shipping services at all of its retail locations. FedEx Ground is also available as a service option at all FedEx Authorized ShipCenters and other FedEx OnSite locations, including at approximately 18,000 Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons stores.  

As of May 31, 2021, FedEx Ground employed approximately 56,000 permanent full-time and approximately 125,000 permanent part-time employees. During 2021 we have continued to increase hiring at FedEx Ground to keep pace with demand for residential services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, FedEx Ground relies on independent small businesses to conduct its linehaul and pickup-and-delivery operations, as the use of these service providers is well suited to the needs of the ground delivery business and its customers.  

FedEx Ground is defending lawsuits in which it is alleged that FedEx Ground should be treated as an employer of drivers employed by service providers engaged by FedEx Ground. We continue to believe that FedEx Ground is not an employer or joint employer of the drivers of these independent businesses. For a description of these proceedings, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report and Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Annual Report. 

John A. Smith is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Ground. FedEx Ground is headquartered in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania area, and its primary competitors are UPS, the USPS and regional delivery carriers. FedEx Ground also competes with startup companies that combine technology with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. In addition, some high volume package shippers, such as Amazon.com, are developing and implementing in-house delivery capabilities and utilizing independent contractors for deliveries, and may be considered competitors. For example, Amazon.com is investing significant capital to establish a network of hubs and vehicles. 

FedEx Freight Segment  

FedEx Freight is a leading North American provider of LTL freight services, offering choice, simplicity and reliability to meet the needs of LTL shippers — FedEx Freight Priority, when speed is critical to meet a customer’s supply chain needs; FedEx Freight Economy, when a customer can trade time for cost savings; and FedEx Freight Direct, a service to meet the needs of the growing e-commerce market for delivery of heavy, bulky products to or through the door for residences and businesses. Through one comprehensive network of service centers and advanced information systems, FedEx Freight provides service to virtually every U.S. ZIP Code (including Alaska and Hawaii) with industry-leading transit times. FedEx Freight Priority has the fastest published transit times of any nationwide LTL service. Internationally, FedEx Freight Canada offers FedEx Freight Priority service, serving most points in Canada, as well as FedEx Freight Priority and FedEx Freight Economy service between Canada and the U.S. In addition, FedEx Freight serves Mexico, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands via alliances. As of July 15, 2021, the money-back guarantee for all FedEx Freight services remains temporarily suspended as we continue to experience unprecedented volume and customer demand. 

- 14 - 

Through its many service offerings, FedEx Freight can match customers’ time-critical needs with industry-leading transit times. With the expansion of FedEx electronic solutions, LTL shippers have the convenience of a single shipping and tracking solution for FedEx Freight, FedEx Express and FedEx Ground. These solutions make freight shipping easier and provide customers easy access to their account information. The FedEx Freight Advance Notice feature available on FedEx Freight Priority shipments uses the company’s innovative technology systems to proactively notify FedEx Freight customers via the internet, e-mail or fax when a shipment may be delayed beyond its estimated delivery date, providing customers with greater visibility and control of their LTL freight shipments. Customers can also process cross-border LTL shipments to and from Canada and Mexico, as well as intra-Canada and -Mexico shipments, through FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com, FedEx Ship Manager Software, FedEx Ship Manager Server and FedEx Web Services. Additionally, FedEx Freight A.M. Delivery offers freight delivery by 10:30 a.m. within and between the U.S. and Canada. FedEx Freight also offers LTL Select, a free cloud-based, multi-carrier transportation management system that provides customers with visibility into all available carriers and their pricing in one location, as well as the ability to book service and make payments.  

FedEx Freight Direct addresses the large, bulky and hard-to-handle surging e-commerce market and supports ongoing collaboration between FedEx Freight and FedEx Ground. It has three service levels to meet speed and budget needs, with the basic service level available to 100 percent of the contiguous U.S. population and standard and premium service level offerings available to 90% of the U.S. population. 

FedEx Freight periodically publishes updates to the list prices for the majority of its services in its 100 Rules Tariff. In general, shipping rates are based on the service selected, origin, destination, weight, class, any ancillary service charge and whether the customer charged the shipment to a FedEx account. On January 4, 2021, FedEx Freight implemented a 4.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF PZONE and FXF FZONE rates, and a 5.9% average list price increase for customers who use FXF 1000 and FXF 501 rates for shipments within the U.S. and between the contiguous U.S. and Canada. Effective January 18, 2021, FedEx Freight added a surcharge for shipments under a certain classification of base rates and within select U.S. zip codes. 

FedEx Freight has an indexed fuel surcharge, which is adjusted on a weekly basis. The fuel surcharge is based on a weekly fuel price from two days prior to the day in which it is assessed. See the “Results of Operations and Outlook — Consolidated Results — Fuel” section of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition” of this Annual Report for a description and discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.  

As of May 31, 2021, the FedEx Freight segment was operating approximately 29,000 vehicles from a network of nearly 400 service centers and had approximately 44,000 employees. Lance D. Moll is the President and Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Freight, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. FedEx Freight’s primary competitors are YRC Worldwide Inc. (which includes YRC Regional Transportation and YRC Freight), XPO Logistics, Inc., Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., ABF Freight (an ArcBest company), SAIA, Inc. and TFI International Inc. 

In 2014 and 2015, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“Teamsters”) petitioned for National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) elections at sixteen FedEx Freight facilities. The Teamsters lost the vote or withdrew the petition prior to the election at twelve facilities and won the vote at four facilities. To date, at three of the four FedEx Freight facilities that originally voted for Teamster representation, the Teamsters have either been decertified by employee vote or voluntarily withdrawn as bargaining representative. We are currently bargaining with the union at the other facility.  

FedEx Services Segment 

FedEx Services provides our other companies with sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain other back-office support. Through FedEx Services, we provide a convenient single point of access for many customer support functions, enabling us to more effectively sell the entire portfolio of transportation services and to help ensure a consistent and outstanding experience for our customers.  

Rajesh Subramaniam and Robert B. Carter each serve as the Co-President and Co-Chief Executive Officer of FedEx Services, which is based in Memphis, Tennessee. As of May 31, 2021, the FedEx Services segment had approximately 15,000 employees.  

Customer-Driven Technology  

FedEx is a world leader in technology, and FedEx founder Frederick W. Smith’s vision that “the information about a package is as important as the delivery of the package itself” remains at the core of our comprehensive technology strategy. We strive to build technology solutions that will solve our customers’ business problems with simplicity, convenience, speed and reliability. Additionally, FedEx stands at the nexus of digital and physical networks, a crucial intersection for the success of e-commerce deliveries. We continue to expand our e-commerce convenience network and explore innovative alternatives to help customers and businesses deliver. During 2021 we continued to advance a major information technology transition from traditional mainframe computing to cloud-based systems, which is delivering significant benefits in terms of flexibility, security, speed to market and resiliency.

Shipping Management and Precision Tracking 

The fedex.com website is widely recognized for its speed, ease of use and customer-focused features. The advanced tracking capability within FedEx Tracking provides customers with a consolidated view of inbound and outbound shipments. FedEx Virtual Assistant on fedex.com is an artificial-intelligence-enabled service that provides answers to customer shipping questions, allowing our customer service representatives and sales professionals to focus on higher-value customer interactions. International Shipping Assist on fedex.com uses artificial intelligence to continually improve the process of completing the complicated paperwork required for international shipping.  

FedEx Surround allows any business to enhance visibility into its supply chain by leveraging data to provide near-real-time analytics into shipment tracking, which will drive more precise logistics and inventory management. SenseAware, a FedEx innovation currently available in nearly 90 countries worldwide, allows customers to stay connected to their critical shipments by providing real-time updates regarding current location, precise temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure readings, light exposure and shock events. Additionally, in 2021 we launched FedEx SenseAware ID, a lightweight sensor-based logistics device that delivers a new level of precision tracking. The enhanced location visibility provided by FedEx SenseAware ID will create opportunities for FedEx customers to reimagine their supply chains through real-time updates on a package’s location within the FedEx Express network. An initial round of customers in the healthcare, aerospace and retail industries received access to FedEx SenseAware ID data in November 2020, and FedEx is currently expanding access to additional customers. We plan to eventually make FedEx SenseAware ID available for a broad range of premium FedEx Express services. 

FedEx Mobile is a suite of solutions including the FedEx mobile application, FedEx mobile website and SMS text messaging. The FedEx Mobile app provides convenience for recipients to track packages, get quick rates and estimated delivery times, quickly find the nearest FedEx location and easily access FedEx Delivery Manager to customize home deliveries. It is available on Android™ and Apple devices. The FedEx mobile website has expanded to more than 220 countries and territories and 40 languages. FedEx Mobile allows customers to track packages, create shipping labels, view account-specific rate quotes and access drop-off location information. SMS Notifications allows customers to track or follow a package via text messaging, and it is currently available in five countries.  

Our FedEx Ship Manager suite of solutions offers a wide range of options to help our customers manage their parcel and LTL shipping and associated processes. Additionally, our state-of-the-art Packaging Lab designs innovative custom packaging solutions to keep shipments protected through transit. 

E-Commerce Solutions 

FedEx Delivery Manager allows our U.S. residential customers to customize home deliveries to fit their schedule by providing a range of options to schedule dates, locations and times of delivery. Additionally, FedEx Returns Technology, a comprehensive solution for returns management, provides high-volume merchants and e-tailers complete visibility into returns and an easy way to track shipments, manage inventory, analyze returns trends and make more informed decisions based on shoppers’ returns behaviors.  

FedEx OnSite, our retail convenience network, utilizes third-party retailers to receive and hold packages for FedEx customers. As of July 15, 2021, the FedEx OnSite network has grown to include approximately 18,000 Walgreens, Dollar General and Albertsons stores in addition to our more than 2,200 FedEx Office locations. In addition to allowing for an easy returns and drop-off experience for shoppers, the FedEx OnSite network is well positioned to serve as a “buy online, pickup in store” network for small and medium merchants without brick-and-mortar locations. We have also added FedEx Returns Technology to the Walgreens retail network, which allows for in-store printing of return shipping labels and eliminates the need to include a return label in every package. 

We have expanded e-commerce delivery options for retailers with FedEx Extra Hours, a service that enables participating retailers to fulfill e-commerce orders into the evening and receive late pickups by FedEx Express, with next-day local delivery and two-day shipping to any address in the continental U.S. FedEx Extra Hours, which is currently available to select customers, allows retailers to extend evening order cutoff times by five to eight hours, with some as late as midnight, depending on their current order fulfillment process.  

FedEx Dataworks 

The size and scale of our global network, and the more than 19 million packages that traverse it every day, gives us a bird’s-eye view of global supply chains and trends. This foundation provides an immense amount of data we can use to build better insights, increase visibility and improve the customer experience. To fully harness the power of this data, in 2021 we launched FedEx Dataworks, a new organization focused on putting our data into context and using it to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members. FedEx Dataworks will create solutions that build “the network for what’s next” by collaborating across the FedEx enterprise to integrate the technology and services integral to the success of our customers. Further, FedEx Dataworks will help to facilitate an open and collaborative e-commerce ecosystem that helps merchants provide seamless end-to-end experiences for their customers. 

- 16 - 

ShopRunner, which we acquired in December 2020, is an e-commerce platform that directly connects brands and merchants with online shoppers. ShopRunner members enjoy benefits that include free two-day shipping, free returns, member-exclusive discounts and seamless checkout. ShopRunner’s data-driven marketing and omnichannel enablement capabilities also help brands and merchants acquire high-value customers and accelerate their digital innovation by using ShopRunner’s e-commerce platform. We believe the complementary nature of ShopRunner’s pre-purchase offerings combined with FedEx’s post-purchase logistics intelligence will enable brands and merchants to attract and engage consumers at scale by providing innovative online shopping experiences. 

In April 2021, we announced a new, multi-year collaboration with Adobe, starting with the integration of ShopRunner with Adobe Commerce’s Magento platform, which we expect will be available to Adobe merchants in late calendar 2021. By integrating their online storefronts with ShopRunner, Adobe merchants will be able to offer seamless checkout, two-day shipping, easy returns and exclusive offers to shippers. The collaboration will also give merchants access to FedEx post-purchase logistics intelligence, allowing for better management of supply chains. 

Autonomous Delivery Technology 

FedEx is exploring the use of autonomous delivery technologies within its operations. Roxo, the FedEx SameDay Bot, an autonomous delivery device designed to help retailers make on-demand same-day and last-mile deliveries to their customers, continues development and testing in select markets. In 2020, we announced our collaboration with two business partners to launch a pilot drone delivery service to explore methods of enhancing last-mile residential delivery service and in June 2021 announced a multi-year, multi-phase agreement to test Nuro’s next-generation autonomous delivery vehicle within FedEx operations. The collaboration with Nuro will explore various use cases for on-road autonomous vehicle logistics such as multi-stop and appointment-based deliveries. We are also working with major national retailers, fast food restaurants and drug stores to help assess different customers’ autonomous delivery needs. 

Marketing  

The FedEx brand name symbolizes outstanding service, reliability and speed. Emphasis is continually placed on promoting and protecting the FedEx brand, one of our most important assets. As a result, FedEx is one of the most widely recognized brands in the world. In addition to television, print and digital advertising, we promote the FedEx brand through sponsorships and special events. For example, FedEx sponsors:  

•  

The UEFA Champions League, which is broadcast in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. 

•  

The season-long FedExCup competition on the PGA TOUR. 

•  

The World Golf Championships FedEx St. Jude Invitational, a PGA TOUR event that has raised millions of dollars for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and is one of four annual World Golf Championships events. 

•  

FedExField in the Washington, DC area.  

•  

The #11 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry driven by Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR Cup Series.  

•  

ATP Tour men’s professional tennis circuit. 

•  

FedExForum in Memphis, TN. 

•  

The NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies as the team’s official jersey sponsor. 

Additionally, FedEx is the “Official Delivery Service Sponsor” and “Official Office Services Provider” of the NFL, through which we conduct events and other activities to promote the FedEx Brand, such as the “FedEx Air & Ground®” NFL Players of the Week and Players of the Year Awards. 

Information Security 

FedEx Services has a team of highly qualified professionals dedicated to securing information about our customers’ shipments and protecting our customers’, vendors’ and employees’ privacy, and we strive to provide a safe, secure online environment for our customers. We are committed to compliance with applicable information security laws, regulations and industry standards — including, for example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a set of comprehensive requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council, as well as compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which enforces the security and confidentiality of employee health information. For a description of risks related to information security, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.

Regulation  

Air. Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (the “Federal Aviation Act”), both the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) exercise regulatory authority over FedEx Express.  

The FAA’s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation, including aircraft standards and maintenance, as well as personnel and ground facilities, which may from time to time affect the ability of FedEx Express to operate its aircraft in the most efficient manner. FedEx Express holds an air carrier certificate granted by the FAA pursuant to Part 119 of the federal aviation regulations. This certificate is of unlimited duration and remains in effect so long as FedEx Express maintains its standards of safety and meets the operational requirements of the regulations.  

The DOT’s authority relates primarily to economic aspects of air transportation. The DOT’s jurisdiction extends to aviation route authority and to other regulatory matters, including the transfer of route authority between carriers. FedEx Express holds various certificates issued by the DOT, authorizing FedEx Express to engage in U.S. and international air transportation of property and mail on a worldwide basis.  

Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.  

FedEx Express participates in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Under this program, the U.S. Department of Defense may requisition for military use certain of FedEx Express’s wide-bodied aircraft in the event of a declared need, including a national emergency. FedEx Express is compensated for the operation of any aircraft requisitioned under the CRAF program at standard contract rates established each year in the normal course of awarding contracts. Through its participation in the CRAF program, FedEx Express is entitled to bid on peacetime military cargo charter business. FedEx Express, together with a consortium of other carriers, currently contracts with the U.S. government for such charter flights.  

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report for discussion of regulations related to pilots, including the proposed pilot flight and duty time regulations, that could affect our business. 

Ground. The ground transportation performed by FedEx Express is integral to its air transportation services. The enactment of the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 abrogated the authority of states to regulate the rates, routes or services of intermodal all-cargo air carriers and most motor carriers. States may now only exercise jurisdiction over safety and insurance. FedEx Express is registered in those states that require registration.  

The operations of FedEx Ground, FedEx Freight and FedEx Custom Critical in interstate commerce are currently regulated by the DOT and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which retain limited oversight authority over motor carriers. Federal legislation preempts regulation by the states of rates, routes and services in intrastate freight transportation.  

Like other interstate motor carriers, our operations, including those at FedEx Express, are subject to certain DOT safety requirements governing interstate operations. In addition, vehicle weight and dimensions remain subject to both federal and state regulations.  

- 20 - 

International. FedEx Express’s international authority permits it to carry cargo and mail from points in its U.S. route system to numerous points throughout the world. The DOT regulates international routes and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. The right of a U.S. carrier to serve foreign points is subject to the DOT’s approval and generally requires a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and the foreign government. In addition, the carrier must then be granted the permission of such foreign government to provide specific flights and services. The regulatory environment for global aviation rights may from time to time impair the ability of FedEx Express to operate its air network in the most efficient manner, and efficient operations often utilize open skies provisions of aviation agreements. Additionally, global air cargo carriers, such as FedEx Express, are subject to current and potential additional aviation security regulation by U.S. and foreign governments.  

Our operations outside of the U.S., such as FedEx Express’s international domestic operations, are also subject to current and potential regulations, including certain postal regulations and licensing requirements, that restrict, make difficult and sometimes prohibit, the ability of foreign-owned companies such as FedEx Express to compete effectively in parts of the international domestic transportation and logistics market.  

Communication. Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft and ground transportation operations, FedEx Express is subject to the Federal Communications Commission Act of 1934, as amended. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses FedEx Express’s activities pertaining to satellite communications.  

Environmental. Pursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. FedEx Express’s aircraft fleet is in compliance with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. In addition to federal regulation of aircraft noise, certain airport operators have local noise regulations, which limit aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day. These regulations have had a restrictive effect on FedEx Express’s aircraft operations in some of the localities where they apply but do not have a material effect in any of FedEx Express’s significant markets. Congress’s passage of the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 established a National Noise Policy, which enabled FedEx Express to plan for noise reduction and better respond to local noise constraints. FedEx Express’s international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain of the countries in which it operates.  

Concern over climate change, including the impact of global warming, has led to significant U.S. and international legislative and regulatory efforts to limit GHG emissions, including our aircraft and vehicle engine emissions. Increasingly, state and local governments are also considering GHG regulatory requirements.  

Compliance with such regulation and the associated potential cost is complicated by the fact that various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change. For example, the EU has established the Emissions Trading System (“ETS”) to regulate GHG emissions in the EU and adopted a directive in 2008 requiring each EU member state to extend the ETS to aviation operations. Efforts by the EU in 2009 to regulate flights arriving from or departing for airports outside of the EU were postponed. The EU extended its stay on the extra-territorial application of the EU ETS as applied to international flights to and from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) through the end of calendar 2023, contingent on successful implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”).  

In 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) passed a resolution adopting CORSIA, which is a global, market-based measure for purchasing credits to offset carbon dioxide emissions and intended to aid in meeting the ICAO’s goal of carbon neutral growth starting in calendar 2020 by complementing industry efforts in infrastructure upgrades, technology, operations and sustainable aviation fuel. In June 2018, the ICAO adopted standards pertaining to country-by-country implementation including the collection and reporting of information on international aviation emissions beginning in calendar 2019. In furtherance of these efforts, in March 2019 the FAA issued notice of a CORSIA program permitting U.S. carriers to submit emissions data on a voluntary basis. Data reported will be used to set the initial emissions baseline, and beginning in calendar 2021 carriers subject to the requirements of CORSIA will be responsible for purchasing and retiring carbon credits to offset emissions in excess of the initial baseline. In response to the creation of the CORSIA program, in December 2017, the EU adopted a proposal that indefinitely excludes from the ETS flights operating fully or partly outside the EU and gradually reduces the number of aviation allowances from calendar 2021. The EU has indicated that it will assess CORSIA implementation and determine the future status of the ETS as applied to international aviation to and from the EEA. We expect compliance with CORSIA to increase FedEx operating expenses beginning in calendar 2021. The amount of such increase will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including the number of our flights subject to CORSIA, the fuel efficiency of our fleet, the average growth of the aviation sector, our ability to utilize sustainable aviation fuels in the future and the price of ICAO-eligible emission units or offsets required to be purchased by FedEx.  

- 21 - 

Additionally, in calendar 2016, the EPA issued a finding that aircraft engine GHG emissions cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. In March 2017, ICAO adopted new carbon dioxide emissions standards that would apply not only to new aircraft types as of calendar 2020, but also to new deliveries of current in-production aircraft types from calendar 2023. Additionally, a cutoff date of calendar 2028 for production of aircraft that do not comply with proposed standards was adopted. These standards are considered to be especially stringent for larger aircraft weighing over 60 tons. In December 2020, the EPA adopted its own aircraft and aircraft engine GHG emissions standards, which are aligned with the 2017 ICAO emissions standards. In the past, the U.S. Congress has also considered bills that would regulate GHG emissions, and some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. In 2021 the U.S. reentered the Paris climate accord, an agreement among 197 countries to reduce GHG emissions. The effect of the reentry on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions and on other GHG regulation is uncertain. Additionally, the extent to which other countries implement that agreement could have an adverse direct or indirect effect on our business. 

We are also subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the shipment of dangerous goods and contingency planning for spills of petroleum products. Additionally, we are subject to numerous regulations dealing with underground fuel storage tanks, hazardous waste handling, vehicle and equipment emissions and noise and the discharge of effluents from our properties and equipment. We have environmental management programs designed to ensure compliance with these regulations.  

Export Controls. In recent years, the U.S. government has increased the number of companies and persons subject to U.S. export control regulations. Such regulations can restrict the types of items that FedEx customers are permitted to ship to certain entities, and in some instances may prohibit FedEx from serving certain entities altogether. Violations of these regulations can result in significant monetary and other penalties. For example, the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 (the “ECRA”) and its implementing regulations, the Export Administration Regulations (the “EARs”), hold carriers such as FedEx strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. Violations of the ECRA can result in criminal penalties of up to $1 million and civil penalties of $305,000 (or twice the value of the transaction) per individual violation. FedEx is investing in improvements and updates to its export control compliance programs. However, the heightened focus on export controls by the U.S. government increases FedEx’s exposure to potential regulatory penalties and could result in higher compliance costs.  

In June 2019 FedEx filed suit in U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia seeking to enjoin the U.S. Department of Commerce (the “DOC”) from enforcing prohibitions contained in the EARs against FedEx. FedEx believes that the EARs violate common carriers’ rights to due process under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution as they unreasonably hold common carriers strictly liable for shipments that may violate the EARs without requiring evidence that the carriers had knowledge of any violations. In September 2020 the court granted the DOC’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. In November 2020 we appealed this decision. 

Customs. Our activities, including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the TSA within the Department of Homeland Security (customs brokerage and security issues), the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission (ocean freight forwarding) and the DOT (air freight forwarding). Our offshore operations are subject to similar regulation by the regulatory authorities of foreign jurisdictions.  

Labor. All U.S. employees at FedEx Express are covered by the Railway Labor Act of 1926, as amended (the “RLA”), while labor relations within the U.S. at our other companies are governed by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, as amended (the “NLRA”). Under the RLA, groups that wish to unionize must do so across nationwide classes of employees. The RLA also requires mandatory government-led mediation of contract disputes supervised by the National Mediation Board before a union can strike or an employer can replace employees or impose contract terms. This part of the RLA helps minimize the risk of strikes that would shut down large portions of the economy. Under the NLRA, employees can unionize in small localized groups, and government-led mediation is not a required step in the negotiation process.  

The RLA was originally passed to govern railroad and express carrier labor negotiations. As transportation systems evolved, the law expanded to cover airlines, which are the dominant national transportation systems of today. As an air express carrier with an integrated air/ground network, FedEx Express and its employees have been covered by the RLA since the founding of the company in 1971. The purpose of the RLA is to offer employees a process by which to unionize (if they choose) and engage in collective bargaining while also protecting global commerce from damaging work stoppages and delays. Specifically, the RLA ensures that an entire transportation system, such as at FedEx Express, cannot be shut down by the actions of a local segment of the network.  

The U.S. Congress has, in the past, considered adopting changes in labor laws that would make it easier for unions to organize units of our employees. For example, there is always a possibility that Congress could remove most FedEx Express employees from the jurisdiction of the RLA, thereby exposing the FedEx Express network to sporadic labor disputes and the risk that small groups of employees could disrupt the entire air/ground network. In addition, federal and state governmental agencies, such as the National Mediation Board and the NLRB, have and may continue to take actions that could make it easier for our employees to organize under the RLA or NLRA. For a description of these and other potential labor law changes, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report. 

- 22 - 

Data Protection. Recently, there has been heightened regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and abroad. For example, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in 2018, greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of EU law and adds a broad array of requirements related to personal data, including individual notice and opt-out preferences and the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Additionally, violations of the GDPR can result in fines of as much as 4% of a company’s annual revenue. Other governments have enacted or are enacting similar data protection laws, including data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. For more information regarding data protection regulation, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report.
