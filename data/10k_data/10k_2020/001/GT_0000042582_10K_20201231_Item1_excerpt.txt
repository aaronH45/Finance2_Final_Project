DESCRIPTION OF GOODYEAR’S BUSINESS 

GENERAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR SEGMENTS 

For the year ended December 31, 2020, we operated our business through three operating segments representing our regional tire businesses: Americas; Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific. 

Our principal business is the development, manufacture, distribution and sale of tires and related products and services worldwide. We manufacture and market numerous lines of rubber tires for: 

•  

automobiles 

•  

trucks 

•  

buses 

•  

aircraft 

•  

motorcycles 

•  

earthmoving and mining equipment 

•  

farm implements 

•  

industrial equipment, and 

•  

various other applications. 

In each case, our tires are offered for sale to vehicle manufacturers for mounting as original equipment (“OE”) and for replacement worldwide. We manufacture and sell tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various other Goodyear owned “house” brands, and the private-label brands of certain customers. In certain geographic areas we also: 

•  

retread truck, aviation and off-the-road ("OTR") tires, 

•  

manufacture and sell tread rubber and other tire retreading materials, 

•  

sell chemical products, and/or 

•  

provide automotive and commercial repair services and miscellaneous other products and services. 

Our principal products are new tires for most applications. Approximately 84% of our sales in 2020, 85% in 2019 and 84% in 2018 were for tire units. Sales of chemical products to unaffiliated customers were 3% in 2020, 3% in 2019 and 4% in 2018

GOODYEAR’S ANNUAL TIRE UNIT SALES — REPLACEMENT AND OE 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

New tires are sold under highly competitive conditions throughout the world. On a worldwide basis, we have two major competitors: Bridgestone (based in Japan) and Michelin (based in France). Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Hankook, Kumho, Nexen, Pirelli, Sumitomo, Toyo, Yokohama and various regional tire manufacturers. 

We compete with other tire manufacturers on the basis of product design, performance, price and terms, reputation, warranty terms, customer service and consumer convenience. Goodyear and Dunlop branded tires enjoy a high recognition factor and have a reputation for performance and product design. The Kelly, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and various house brand tire lines offered by us, and tires manufactured and sold by us to private brand customers, compete primarily on the basis of value and price. 

We do not consider our tire businesses to be seasonal to any significant degree. 

AMERICAS 

Americas, our largest segment in terms of revenue, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells tires and related products and services in North, Central and South America, and sells tires to various export markets, primarily through intersegment sales. Americas manufactures tires in five plants in the United States, two plants in Canada and five plants in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. 

Americas manufactures and sells tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, earthmoving, mining and industrial equipment, aircraft, and various other applications. 

Goodyear brand radial passenger tire lines sold throughout Americas include the Assurance family of product lines for the premium and mid-tier passenger and cross-over utility segments; the Eagle and EfficientGrip Performance families of product lines for the high-performance segment; the Wrangler family of product lines for the sport utility vehicle and light truck segments; as well as the WinterCommand and Ultra Grip family of winter tires. Additionally, we offer Dunlop brand radial

AMERICAS UNIT SALES — REPLACEMENT AND OE 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Americas is a major supplier of tires to most manufacturers of automobiles, trucks, buses, aircraft, and earthmoving, mining and industrial equipment that have production facilities located in the Americas. 

Americas' primary competitors are Bridgestone and Michelin. Other significant competitors include Continental, Cooper, Nexen, Pirelli, and imports from other regions, primarily Asia. 

The principal channel for the sale of Goodyear brand tires in Americas is a large network of independent dealers. Goodyear, Dunlop and Kelly brand tires are also sold to numerous national and regional retailers, in Goodyear Company-owned stores in the United States, and through the wholesale channel, including through TireHub, our sole national wholesale tire distributor in the United States, and a network of aligned U.S. regional wholesale tire distributors.  

Our products sold in the United States are subject to Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (“FMVSS”) promulgated and enforced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), which has established various standards and regulations applicable to tires sold in the United States and tires sold in a foreign country that are identical or substantially similar to tires sold in the United States. NHTSA has the authority to order the recall of automotive products, including tires, having a defect related to motor vehicle safety or that do not comply with a motor vehicle safety standard. In addition, the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act (the “TREAD Act”) imposes numerous reporting requirements with respect to the early warning reporting of warranty claims, property damage claims, and bodily injury and

Table of Contents 

fatality claims. The FMVSS also require tire manufacturers to comply with rigorous tire testing standards. Compliance with these regulations has increased the cost of producing and distributing tires in the United States. 

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA 

Europe, Middle East and Africa, our second largest segment in terms of revenue, develops, manufactures, distributes and sells tires for automobiles, trucks, buses, aircraft, motorcycles, and earthmoving, mining and industrial equipment throughout Europe, the Middle East and Africa under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands and other house brands, and sells tires to various export markets, primarily through intersegment sales. EMEA manufactures tires in thirteen plants in France, Germany, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovenia, South Africa and Turkey. EMEA also: 

•  

sells aviation tires and manufactures and sells retreaded aviation tires, 

•  

provides various retreading and related services for truck and OTR tires, primarily for its commercial truck tire customers, 

•  

offers automotive repair services at Company-owned retail outlets, and 

•  

provides miscellaneous other products and services. 

In 2020, EMEA launched a number of new consumer tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop, Debica, Sava and Fulda brands, including the Goodyear EfficientGrip Performance 2 for the high performance segment and the Goodyear Vector 4Seasons Gen-3 and Dunlop Sport All Season tire for the all-season segment. EMEA also introduced a number of commercial truck tires, including line extensions of the FuelMax Gen-2 and KMAX Gen-2.

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA UNIT SALES — REPLACEMENT AND OE 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

EMEA is a significant supplier of tires to most vehicle manufacturers across the region. 

EMEA’s primary competitors are Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental, Pirelli, several regional and local tire producers, and imports from other regions, primarily Asia. 

Goodyear and Dunlop brand tires are sold for replacement in EMEA through various channels of distribution, principally independent multi-brand tire dealers. In some areas, Goodyear brand tires, as well as Dunlop, Debica, Sava and Fulda brand tires, are distributed through independent dealers, regional distributors and retail outlets, of which approximately 80 are owned by Goodyear. In 2020, we took actions to better align our European distribution network in order to capture the full value of our products and brands in the marketplace. 

Our European operations are subject to regulation by the European Union. The Tire Safety Regulation sets performance standards that tires for cars and light and commercial trucks need to meet for rolling resistance, wet grip braking (passenger car tires only) and noise in order to be sold in the European Union. The Tire Labeling Regulation applies to all passenger car, light truck and commercial truck tires and requires that consumers be informed about the tire's fuel efficiency, wet grip and noise characteristics.

In Australia, we also operate a network of approximately 180 retail stores under the Beaurepaires brand. 

GENERAL BUSINESS INFORMATION 

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 

The principal raw materials used by Goodyear are synthetic and natural rubber. Synthetic rubber accounts for approximately 52% of all rubber consumed by us on an annual basis. Our plants located in Beaumont and Houston, Texas supply a major portion of our global synthetic rubber requirements. We purchase all of our requirements for natural rubber in the world market. 

Other important raw materials and components we use are carbon black, steel cord, fabrics and petrochemical-based commodities. Substantially all of these raw materials and components are purchased from independent suppliers, except for certain chemicals we manufacture. We purchase most raw materials and components in significant quantities from several suppliers, except in those instances where only one or a few qualified sources are available. We anticipate the continued availability of all raw materials and components we will require during 2021, subject to spot shortages and unexpected disruptions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, and other events. 

Substantial quantities of fuel and other petrochemical-based commodities are used in the production of tires, synthetic rubber and other products. Supplies of such fuels and commodities have been and are expected to continue to be available to us in quantities sufficient to satisfy our anticipated requirements, subject to spot shortages.

Human Capital Management 

At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 62,000 full-time and temporary associates throughout the world, including approximately 36,000 associates covered under collective bargaining agreements. During 2020, our employment of full-time and temporary associates decreased by approximately 1,000 people, primarily related to the permanent closure of our Gadsden, Alabama manufacturing facility. Approximately 5,700 of our associates in the United States are covered by a master collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers ("USW"), which expires in July 2022. In addition, approximately 800 of our associates in the United States are covered by other contracts with the USW and various other unions. Approximately 20,000 of our associates outside of the United States are covered by union contracts that currently have expired or that will expire in 2021, primarily in Germany, Luxembourg, China, Slovenia, France, Turkey, India and Mexico. Unions represent a major portion of our associates in the United States and Europe. 

Engaging and enabling our associates to realize their full potential is one of our core strategies. This starts with attracting top diverse talent and is followed by fostering inclusion, offering opportunities for skill and career development, promoting health and wellness, providing a safe and healthy workplace, making a positive impact in our communities, and expecting our associates to know and comply with our compliance and ethics policies. 

Talent Management — Our associates are the driving force behind our success. They underpin every aspect of our strategy and help us deliver value to our customers, shareholders and communities. We provide integrated talent management and learning solutions aimed at enabling our associates to reach their full personal and professional potential at Goodyear. We are guided by our talent strategy which focuses on talent attraction, talent development, talent engagement and retention, as well as succession planning. An example of how we attract talent is through campus recruiting into our intern and job rotational programs utilized by several of our functional teams. We offer a number of tools for talent development including The Goodyear Learning Center, which is our in-house collection of online courses available to all associates. In our manufacturing plants, one of the pillars of our plant optimization efforts is Continuous Skills Development, which focuses on developing problem-solving and decision-making skills. 

Diversity and Inclusion — A diverse workforce is critical to our long-term success. Embracing and valuing differences allows us to attract top talent, improve associate satisfaction and engagement, foster innovation, and meld varying experiences and perspectives to drive enhanced customer service, business creativity and decision-making. Our goal is to create a work environment where people have a real sense of belonging and are able to thrive. Our commitment is reflected in the policies that govern our workforce, such as our Business Conduct Manual and Global Zero Tolerance policy and is evidenced in our recruiting strategies, succession planning, diversity and inclusion training and Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”), which are key to our inclusion efforts. Our ERGs provide associates access to coaching, mentoring and professional development, and include the Goodyear Black Network, Goodyear Veterans Association, Goodyear Women’s Network, Goodyear Pride Network, HOLA (Hispanic/Latino), Next Generation Leaders and Goodyear Asia India Middle East (AIM). 

Health and Wellness — Our wellness initiatives take a holistic view of associate health, including physical, emotional, financial and social health, to enable our associates to thrive and bring their best selves to work each day. Goodyear strives to be at the forefront of corporate wellness, and that goal is the driver behind our “GoodLife” wellness program, which is led by our Chief Health Officer, in order to foster a culture of wellness for all Goodyear associates and their families. To meet the needs of our diverse workforce, retirees and their dependents, we offer varying robust benefits packages for our full-time and part-time associates globally.  

Workforce Safety and Wellness — Our vision is to have the safest operations in the world. We have established a goal of eliminating all serious injuries and fatalities in our workplace. To reduce the risk of serious injuries we invest in systems that enable us to receive reliable and structured data to enable decision making. We also work to improve our industrial hygiene to prevent work-related illness from noise and the substances used in the manufacturing process and we focus on ergonomics using a six-step problem-solving process to reduce injuries and maximize workplace performance.  

Community Engagement — Collaborating with community organizations energizes our associates and helps us build a better future. Our global strategy and efforts are an extension of our business and are aimed at safe mobility, inspiring students to reach their full potential and reducing our environmental impacts. We encourage our associates to participate in our Global Week of Volunteering. 

Compliance and Ethics — To “Act with Integrity” is a core component of our global strategy. Each associate is responsible for acting with honesty, integrity and respect every day and everywhere we do business. Our Business Conduct Manual guides our Board of Directors, executive team and all associates globally. We require our global salaried associates to complete training

annually on our Business Conduct Manual and periodically on subjects such as competition law, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, and being a compliance leader. 

Refer to "Overview — Results of Operations" included in Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for information on the human capital management actions we have taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Patents and Trademarks 

We own approximately 1,800 product, process and equipment patents issued by the United States Patent Office and approximately 3,600 patents issued or granted in other countries around the world. We have approximately 400 applications for United States patents pending and approximately 800 patent applications on file in other countries around the world. While such patents and patent applications as a group are important, we do not consider any patent or patent application to be of such importance that the loss or expiration thereof would materially affect Goodyear or any business segment. 

We own, control or use approximately 1,500 different trademarks, including several using the word “Goodyear” or the word “Dunlop.” Approximately 8,300 registrations and 300 pending applications worldwide protect these trademarks. While such trademarks as a group are important, the only trademarks we consider material to our business, or to the business of any of our segments, are those using the word “Goodyear,” and with respect to certain of our international business segments, those using the word “Dunlop.” We believe our trademarks are valid and most are of unlimited duration as long as they are adequately protected and appropriately used. 

Compliance with Government Regulations 

We are subject to extensive regulation under environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations worldwide. These laws and regulations relate to, among other things, air emissions, discharges to surface and underground waters, the generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste materials and hazardous substances, and workplace safety and health. We have several continuing programs designed to ensure compliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations. We expect capital expenditures for pollution control facilities and occupational safety and health projects to be approximately $40 million and $35 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively. 

We also incur ongoing expenses to maintain and operate our pollution control facilities and conduct our other environmental activities, including the control and disposal of hazardous substances. These expenditures are expected to be sufficient to comply with existing environmental laws and regulations and are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our competitive position. In the future, we may incur increased costs and additional charges associated with environmental compliance and cleanup projects necessitated by the identification of new waste sites, the impact of new environmental laws and regulatory standards, or the availability of new technologies. Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in the future may require a material increase in our capital expenditures and could adversely affect our earnings and competitive position. 

In addition, compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include import and export laws, anti-competition laws, anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, data privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws, and accounting, internal control and disclosure requirements. 

Refer to “Description of Goodyear’s Business – Americas” and “Description of Goodyear’s Business – Europe, Middle East and Africa” included in this Item 1, “Business” for information regarding compliance with government regulations in each of those segments.
