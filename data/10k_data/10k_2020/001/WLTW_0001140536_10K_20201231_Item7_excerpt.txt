ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

This discussion includes forward-looking statements. See ‘Disclaimer Regarding Forward-looking Statements’ for certain cautionary information regarding forward-looking statements and ‘Risk Factors’ in Item 1A for a list of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in those statements. 

This discussion includes references to non-GAAP financial measures as defined in the rules of the SEC. We present such non-GAAP financial measures, specifically, adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures, as we believe such information is of interest to the investment community because it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company’s operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent under U.S. GAAP, and these provide a measure against which our businesses may be assessed in the future. 

Our methods of calculating these measures may differ from those used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. These financial measures should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

See ‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ below for further discussion of our adjusted, constant currency and organic non-GAAP financial measures. 

Executive Overview 

Market Conditions 

Within our insurance and brokerage business, the cyclical nature of the insurance market and the impact of other market conditions on insurance premiums, commission revenue may vary widely between accounting periods. A period of low or declining premium rates, generally known as a ‘soft’ or ‘softening’ market, generally leads to downward pressure on commission revenue and can have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating margin. A ‘hard’ or ‘firming’ market, during which premium rates rise, generally has a favorable impact on our revenue and operating margin. Rates, however, vary by geography, industry and client segment. As a result, and due to the global and diverse nature of our business, we view rates in the aggregate. Overall, we are currently seeing a modest but definite improvement with pricing in the market. 

Market conditions in the broking industry in which we operate are generally defined by factors such as the strength of the economies in the various geographic regions in which we serve around the world, insurance rate movements, and insurance and reinsurance buying patterns of our clients.  

The markets for our consulting, technology and solutions, and marketplace services are affected by economic, regulatory and legislative changes, technological developments, and increased competition from established and new competitors. We believe that the primary factors in selecting a human resources or risk management consulting firm include reputation, the ability to provide measurable increases to shareholder value and return on investment, global scale, quality of service and the ability to tailor services to clients’ unique needs. In that regard, we are focused on developing and implementing technology, data and analytic solutions for both internal operations and for maintaining industry standards and meeting client preferences. We have made such investments from time to time and may decide, based on perceived business needs, to make investments in the future that may be greater than we currently anticipate. Conversely, particularly given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may make fewer information technology-based investments than previously anticipated, which could potentially create business operational risk. 

With regard to the market for exchanges, we believe that clients base their decisions on a variety of factors that include the ability of the provider to deliver measurable cost savings for clients, a strong reputation for efficient execution and an innovative service delivery model and platform. Part of the employer-sponsored insurance market has matured and become more fragmented while other segments remain in the entry phase. As these market segments continue to evolve, we may experience growth in intervals, with periods of accelerated expansion balanced by periods of modest growth. In recent years, growth in the market for exchanges has slowed, and we expect this trend may continue. 

Following the occurrence of Brexit and the end of the formal transition period on December 31, 2020, a trade agreement has been established between the U.K. and E.U. As expected, the agreement largely addresses goods and not services, and the Company has therefore completed the establishment of appropriate arrangements for the continued servicing of client business in all relevant E.U. countries. It is anticipated that further negotiations will ensue between the U.K. and E.U. in order to address matters related to services, including financial services, though the outcome of such discussions and potential impact on the Company are not yet known. For a further discussion of the risks of Brexit to the Company, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Typically, our business benefits from regulatory change, political risk or economic uncertainty. Insurance broking generally tracks the economy, but demand for both insurance broking and consulting services usually remains steady during times of uncertainty. We have some businesses, such as our health and benefits and administration businesses, which can be counter cyclical during the early period of a significant economic change. 

Although approximately 21% of our revenue is generated in the U.K. on an annual basis, about 12% of revenue is denominated in Pounds sterling, as much of the insurance business is transacted in U.S. dollars. Approximately 20% of our expenses is denominated in Pounds sterling, thus we generally benefit from a weakening Pound sterling in our income from operations. However, we have a Company hedging strategy for this aspect of our business, which is designed to mitigate significant fluctuations in currency. 

See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussions of risks that may affect our ability to compete. 

Proposed Combination with Aon plc 

On March 9, 2020, the Company and Aon issued an announcement disclosing that they had signed a business combination agreement, pursuant to which the Company will be acquired by Aon. The transaction remains subject to various customary closing conditions, including required antitrust and other regulatory approvals. The parties expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2021, subject to satisfaction of these conditions. The transaction also subjects the Company to various incremental risks, both before closing and after the transaction is potentially closed. See ‘Business – The Company’ and ‘Risk Factors – Combination-Related Risks.’ 

Risks and Uncertainties of the COVID-19 Pandemic 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on global commercial activity, including the global supply chain, and has contributed to significant volatility in the global financial markets including, among other effects, occasional declines in the equity markets, changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis. In light of the effects on our own business operations and those of our clients, suppliers and other third parties with whom we interact, the Company has regularly considered the impact of COVID-19 on our business, taking into account our business resilience and continuity plans, financial modeling and stress testing of liquidity and financial resources.  

Generally, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our overall financial results during 2020; however, during 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted our revenue growth, primarily in our businesses that are discretionary in nature. We believe such level of impact will continue through much of 2021, at least until a sufficient portion of the populations in jurisdictions where we do business have been vaccinated and social-distancing orders are lessened or lifted.  

As part of the significant estimates and assumptions that are inherent in our financial statements, we have considered the impact COVID-19 will have on our client behavior and the economic environment looking forward to 2021 and throughout the geographies in which we operate. These estimates and assumptions include the collectability of billed and unbilled receivables, the estimation of revenue, and the fair value of our reporting units, tangible and intangible assets and contingent consideration. With regard to collectability of receivables, we believe we may continue to face atypical delays in client payments going forward. The demand for certain discretionary lines of business has decreased, and we believe that decrease may continue to impact our financial results in succeeding periods. Non-discretionary lines of business have also been, to some extent, adversely affected and may be adversely affected in the future. Further, reduced economic activity or disruption in insurance markets could reduce the demand for or the extent of insurance coverage. For example, we have seen instances where the reduced demand for air travel has reduced the extent of insurance coverage needed. Also, the increased frequency and severity of coverage disputes between our clients and (re)insurers arising out of the pandemic could increase our professional liability risk. We will continue to monitor the situation and assess any implications to our business and our stakeholders.  

The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial position will depend on future developments, which are difficult to predict. These future developments may include the severity and scope of the COVID-19 outbreak, which may unexpectedly change or worsen, and the types and duration of measures imposed by governmental authorities to contain the virus or address its impact. We continue to expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively impact our revenue and operating results in fiscal 2021. We believe that these trends and uncertainties are similar to those faced by other comparable registrants as a result of the pandemic. See also Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for a discussion of actual and potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business, clients and operations. 

Daily Operations - We continue to closely monitor the spread and impact of COVID-19 while adhering to government health directives, including the availability of vaccines. The Company continues to have restrictions on business travel, office access, meetings and events, but is actively developing its return-to-work plans with a focus on safe utilization based on appropriate social-distancing guidelines. We have thorough business continuity and incident management processes in place that have been activated, including split team operations and work-from-home protocols for essential workers which continue to be globally effective. We are communicating frequently with clients and critical vendors, while meeting our objectives via remote working capabilities, overseen  

39 

and coordinated by our incident management response team. While no contingency plan can eliminate all risk of temporary service interruption, we regularly assess and update our plans to help mitigate reasonable risks to the extent possible.  

Financial Statement Overview 

The tables below set forth our summarized consolidated statements of comprehensive income and data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated. For management’s discussion of our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 in comparison with the year ended December 31, 2018, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2020. 

Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income 

($ in millions, except per share data) 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Consolidated Revenue 

We derive the majority of our revenue from commissions from our brokerage services and fees for consulting and administration services. No single client represented a significant concentration of our consolidated revenue for any of our three most recent fiscal years. 

The following table details our top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenue (in U.S. dollars) from the countries where work was performed for the year ended December 31, 2020. These figures do not represent the currency of the related revenue, which is presented in the next table. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The table below details the percentage of our revenue and expenses by transactional currency for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

These percentages exclude certain expenses for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include amortization of intangible assets and transaction and integration expenses. 

The following table sets forth the total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and the components of the change in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the prior year: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $9.4 billion, compared to $9.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $313 million, or 3%, on an as-reported basis. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals, our organic revenue growth was 2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The CRB, IRR and BDA segments had organic revenue growth during the year, while the HCB segment was flat, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 reduction in demand for our discretionary services. The revenue from acquisitions related primarily to TRANZACT, which generated revenue of $557 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to $245 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which represents revenue included from the date of the acquisition of July 30, 2019. 

Our revenue can be materially impacted by changes in currency conversions, which can fluctuate significantly over the course of a calendar year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, currency translation decreased our consolidated revenue by $10 million. The primary currency driving this change was the Brazilian Real. 

Definitions of Constant Currency Change and Organic Change are included in the section entitled ‘Non-GAAP Financial Measures’ elsewhere within this Form 10-K. 

Segment Revenue 

We manage our business across four reportable operating segments: Human Capital and Benefits; Corporate Risk and Broking; Investment, Risk and Reinsurance; and Benefits Delivery and Administration. 

Segment revenue excludes amounts that were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and reimbursed by them (reimbursed expenses); however, these amounts are included in consolidated revenue. 

The Company experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenue. Revenue is typically higher during the Company’s first and fourth quarters due primarily to the timing of broking-related activities.  

Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Segments 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is projected to continue to have, an impact on certain of our service offerings. These impacts, which primarily affect our revenue, have been negative in some instances and positive in others and may in the future be material in either event. In addition, the potential negative impacts on our results may lag behind the developments to date related to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have thus far seen the impact of COVID-19 primarily on our business offerings that are discretionary in nature, such as consultative project work, which spans our segments, but primarily affected our HCB segment. However, most of the services we provide, including broking for various insurance products, compliance and valuation services, risk mitigation and outsourced administration for both pension and health and welfare plans are considered non-discretionary to our clients and recurring in nature. We have seen that these non-discretionary businesses are the least impacted of our offerings and while we expect that trend to continue, our non-discretionary businesses may be adversely affected due to changing demands in the market. 

41 

We expect to continue to experience unpredictable volatility in demand around our discretionary services and solutions. Clients may defer or delay decision-making or planned work or seek to terminate existing agreements for these discretionary services and solutions.  

We recognize that the broad, global nature of the COVID-19 crisis has impacted the liquidity of our clients generally and caused us to not meet our original growth estimates for the year. We continue to monitor the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and take steps to mitigate the risks to us posed by its spread by working with our clients, colleagues, suppliers and other stakeholders. Due to the global breadth of the COVID-19 spread and the range of governmental and community reactions thereto, there is on-going uncertainty around its duration, severity, ultimate impact and the timing of recovery. We believe the pandemic will continue to cause an extended disruption on economic activity in 2021, and the impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be material. Meanwhile, although we cannot predict how long this situation will last, we continue to focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, liquidity and financial flexibility. 

Human Capital and Benefits  

The HCB segment provides an array of advice, broking, solutions and software for our clients. 

HCB is the largest segment of the Company, generating approximately 35% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. HCB is focused on addressing our clients’ people and risk needs to help them take on the challenges of operating in a global marketplace. This segment is further strengthened with teams of international consultants who provide support through each of our business units to the global headquarters of multinational clients and their foreign subsidiaries. 

The HCB segment provides services through four business units: 

•  

Retirement — The Retirement business provides actuarial support, plan design, and administrative services for traditional pension and retirement savings plans. We help our clients assess the costs and risks of retirement plans on cash flow, earnings and the balance sheet, the effects of changing workforce demographics on their retirement plans and retiree benefit adequacy and security. 

•  

Health and Benefits — The Health & Benefits business provides plan management consulting, broking and administration across the full spectrum of health and group benefit programs, including medical, dental, disability, life and other coverage. 

•  

Talent & Rewards — Our Talent & Rewards business provides advice, data, software and products to address clients’ total rewards and talent issues. 

•  

Technology and Administration Solutions — Our Technology and Administration Solutions business provides benefits outsourcing services to clients outside of the U.S. 

The following table sets forth HCB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 

HCB segment revenue for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.3 billion. On an organic basis, the global impact of COVID-19 negatively impacted demand in our Talent and Rewards business. Health and Benefits delivered moderate revenue growth, driven by increased consulting and brokerage services and continued expansion of our client portfolio for both local and global benefit management appointments. In our Retirement and Technology and Administration Solutions businesses, revenue grew modestly as a result of increased project work in the first half of the year, primarily in Great Britain and Western Europe. 

42 

Corporate Risk and Broking  

The CRB segment provides a broad range of risk advice, insurance brokerage and consulting services to our clients worldwide, ranging from small businesses to multinational corporations. The segment delivers integrated global solutions tailored to client needs and underpinned by data and analytics. 

CRB generated approximately 32% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 and places more than $20 billion of premiums into the insurance markets on an annual basis. 

CRB has eight global lines of business: 

•

The following table sets forth CRB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 

CRB segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.0 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. On an organic basis, North America led the segment, followed by Western Europe, primarily with new business generation along with strong renewals. The revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in Great Britain and International, due to a change in the remuneration model for certain lines of business. This change, which is neutral to operating income, results in lower revenue and an equal reduction to salaries and benefits expense. Absent this change, International revenue increased, led by growth in Latin America and Asia. Great Britain was additionally impacted by an internal transfer of a book of business to North America. Apart from these two structural changes, revenue increased modestly due to strong new business and renewals which were partially offset by the impact of COVID-19 on the construction and marine insurance lines. 

Investment, Risk and Reinsurance  

The IRR segment uses a sophisticated approach to risk, which helps our clients free up capital and manage investment complexity. This segment works closely with investors, reinsurers and insurers to manage the equation between risk and return. Blending advanced analytics with deep institutional knowledge, IRR identifies new opportunities to maximize performance. This segment provides  

43 

investment consulting and discretionary management services and insurance-specific services and solutions through reserves opinions, software, ratemaking, risk underwriting and reinsurance broking. 

This segment is our third largest segment and generated approximately 18% of segment revenue for the Company for the year ended December 31, 2020. With approximately 79% of the revenue for this segment split between North America and the U.K., IRR includes the following businesses and offerings: 

•  

Willis Re — Willis Re provides reinsurance industry clients with an understanding of how risk affects capital and financial performance and advises on the best ways to manage related outcomes. 

•  

Insurance Consulting and Technology — Insurance Consulting and Technology is a global business that provides advice and technology solutions to the insurance industry. We combine our consulting and technology solutions to provide guidance on risk and capital management, pricing and predictive modeling, financial and regulatory reporting, financial and capital modeling, M&A, outsourcing and business management. 

•  

Investments — Investments provides advice and discretionary management solutions to improve investment outcomes for asset owners using a broad and sophisticated framework for managing risk. 

•  

Wholesale Insurance Broking — Wholesale Insurance Broking provides specialist broking services primarily to retail and wholesale brokers. 

•

•  

Max Matthiessen — Max Matthiessen is a leading advisor and broker for insurance, benefits, human resources and savings in the Nordic region. The business specializes in providing human capital and benefits administration together with providing market leading savings and insurance solutions. 

The following table sets forth IRR segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019. In September 2020, the Company sold its Max Matthiessen business, and the sale of Miller, its wholesale insurance broking subsidiary, is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2021 (see Note 3 — Acquisitions and Divestitures within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information). The revenue and operating income attributed to these two businesses was $296 million and $80 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 

IRR segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. On an organic basis, most lines of business contributed to the growth. Reinsurance growth was driven by new business wins and favorable renewal factors while Insurance Consulting and Technology revenue grew from strong technology sales. Max Matthiessen revenue increased as a result of overall growth in net commissions. Revenue growth in the Investment businesses resulted from client wins. 

Benefit Delivery and Administration  

The BDA segment provides primary medical and ancillary benefit exchange and outsourcing services to active employees and retirees across both the group and individual markets. A significant portion of the revenue in this segment is recurring in nature, driven by either the commissions from the policies we sell in our employer-based Medicare broking business, or from long-term service contracts with our clients that typically range from three to five years. Revenue across this segment may be seasonal, driven by the magnitude and timing of client enrollment activities, which often occur during the fourth quarter, with increased membership levels typically effective January 1, after calendar year-end benefits elections. On July 30, 2019, the Company acquired TRANZACT, which  

44 

operates as part of the BDA segment. TRANZACT experiences seasonally higher revenue during the fourth quarter due primarily to the timing of the Federal Medicare Open Enrollment window. 

BDA generated approximately 15% of our segment revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. BDA provides services via three related offerings to customers primarily in the U.S.: 

•  

Benefits Outsourcing — This service line is focused on serving active employee groups for clients across the U.S. We use our proprietary technology to provide a broad suite of health and welfare and pension administration outsourcing services, including tools to enable benefit modeling, decision support, enrollment and benefit choice. 

•  

Individual Marketplace — This service line offers decision support processes and tools to connect consumers with insurance carriers in private individual and Medicare markets. Individual Marketplace serves both employer-based and direct-to-consumer populations through its end-to-end consumer acquisition and engagement platforms, which tightly integrate call routing technology, an efficient quoting and enrollment engine, a customer relations management system and deep links with insurance carriers. 

•  

Benefits Accounts — This service line delivers consumer-driven healthcare and reimbursement accounts, including health savings accounts, health reimbursement arrangements and other consumer-directed accounts to our benefits outsourcing, individual marketplace and employer clients. 

The following table sets forth BDA segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the components of the change in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 

BDA segment revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively. BDA’s organic revenue increase was led by Individual Marketplace, primarily by TRANZACT, with growth across all products. Benefits Outsourcing revenue also grew, driven by its expanded client base. For the year ended December 31, 2020, TRANZACT generated revenue of $557 million as compared to $245 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, in which it was partially included from the date of the acquisition of July 30, 2019. 

Costs of Providing Services 

Total costs of providing services for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $8.2 billion, compared to $7.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $459 million, or 6%. See the following discussion for further details. 

Salaries and Benefits 

Salaries and benefits for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $5.5 billion, compared to $5.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $258 million, or 5%. The increase was primarily a result of higher salaries and incentive accruals along with the full year inclusion of TRANZACT’s compensation costs. Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenue, represented 59% and 58% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 

Other Operating Expenses 

Other operating expenses include occupancy, legal, marketing, licenses, royalties, supplies, technology, printing and telephone costs, as well as insurance, including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims, travel by colleagues, publications, professional subscriptions and development, recruitment, other professional fees and irrecoverable value added and sales taxes. 

Other operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.8 billion, compared to $1.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $39 million, or 2%. The increase was primarily due to the full year inclusion of TRANZACT’s operating expenses as well as the settlement of two shareholder litigation suits net of insurance and other recovery receivables (see  

45 

Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies, within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), partially offset by lower travel and entertainment, marketing and occupancy costs during the year.  

Depreciation 

Depreciation represents the expense incurred over the useful lives of our tangible fixed assets and internally-developed software. Depreciation for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $308 million, compared to $240 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $68 million, or 28%. The increase was due to a higher depreciable base of assets resulting from additional assets placed in service during 2019. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase was an additional charge of $35 million which we recognized in the first quarter of 2020 as an acceleration of depreciation related to the abandonment of an internally-developed software asset.  

Amortization 

Amortization represents the amortization of acquired intangible assets, including acquired internally-developed software. Amortization for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $462 million, compared to $489 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $27 million, or 6%. Our intangible amortization is more heavily weighted to the initial years of the useful lives of the related intangibles, and therefore amortization related to intangible assets purchased prior to our acquisition of TRANZACT will continue to decrease over time. This decrease was partially offset by the additional amortization resulting from the intangible assets related to the TRANZACT acquisition. 

Restructuring Costs 

Restructuring costs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $24 million, all of which related to minor restructuring activities carried out by various business lines throughout the Company. There were no restructuring costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.  

Transaction and integration expenses 

Transaction and integration expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 were comprised of $110 million of mostly transaction costs, consisting primarily of legal fees related to our proposed combination with Aon and integration expenses related to the acquisition of TRANZACT in 2019, compared to $13 million of transaction costs, primarily related to the acquisition of TRANZACT, for the year ended December 31, 2019. There were no integration costs incurred during 2019 due to the completion of all integration activities in 2018 related to the Merger.  

Income from Operations 

Income from operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.2 billion, compared to $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $146 million. This decrease resulted mostly from higher salaries and benefits and transaction and integration expenses as well as the additional depreciation related to the asset abandonment noted above, partially offset by higher revenue year over year.  

Interest Expense 

Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $244 million and $234 million, respectively. Interest expense is comprised primarily of interest associated with our senior notes. Interest expense increased by $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was primarily due to our additional senior notes offerings during the second half of 2019 and the first half of 2020, and additional indebtedness associated with the TRANZACT acquisition.  

Other Income, Net 

Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $399 million, compared to $227 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $172 million. The increase resulted from the net gains on disposals of operations, primarily due to the disposal of our Max Matthiessen business (see Note 3 – Acquisitions and Divestitures within Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), and higher pension income in the current year.  

Provision for Income Taxes 

Provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $318 million, compared with $249 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were 23.8% and 18.8%, respectively. These effective tax rates are calculated using extended values from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are therefore more precise tax rates than can be calculated from rounded values. The current year effective tax rate is higher primarily due  

46 

to additional tax expense of $61 million in connection with the temporary income tax provisions of the CARES Act. During 2020 the Company elected to utilize the higher section 163(j) 50 percent business interest limitation for tax years 2019 and 2020, which allows the Company to utilize additional interest expense. The utilization of additional interest expense reduces our regular tax liability and reduces our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, however, it creates a base erosion minimum tax expense for these tax years. The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (‘BEAT’) effectively applies a 10 percent minimum tax if modified taxable income, as adjusted for base erosion payments, is greater than the regular tax liability for a year.  

Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson 

Net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson for both the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $1.0 billion, a decrease of $48 million, or 5%. This decrease resulted primarily from higher salaries and benefits, tax expense and transaction and integration expenses, partially offset by higher revenue year over year and the net gains on disposals of operations noted above.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Executive Summary 

Our principal sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities, available cash and cash equivalents and amounts available under our revolving credit facilities and any new debt offerings, subject to the limitations set forth in the Aon combination agreement. These sources of liquidity will fund our short-term and long-term obligations at December 31, 2020. Our most significant long-term obligations include mandatory debt and related interest, operating leases, and pension obligations and contributions to our qualified pension plans.  

During 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to significant volatility in financial markets, including occasional declines in equity markets, changes in interest rates and reduced liquidity on a global basis. Specific to Willis Towers Watson, the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and we believe will continue to have, a negative impact on discretionary work we perform for our clients. We also believe this may continue to impact future cash collections from clients, particularly those in certain harder-hit industries. We have also reduced our spending on travel and associated expenses and third-party contractors, and we have the ability to reduce spending on discretionary projects and certain capital expenditures. 

Based on our current balance sheet and cash flows, current market conditions and information available to us at this time, we believe that Willis Towers Watson has access to sufficient liquidity, which includes all of the borrowing capacity available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months, including investing in the business for growth, scheduled debt repayments and dividend payments. In early 2021, we settled $210 million of obligations related to the Stanford and Willis Towers Watson merger-related securities litigations, and we currently anticipate that the $500 million of 5.750% senior notes maturing in the first quarter of 2021 and related interest will be repaid in full using our current cash and cash equivalents balances.  

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Willis North America Inc., as issuer, completed an offering of an additional $275 million aggregate principal amount of 2.950% senior notes due 2029. Willis North America Inc. previously issued $450 million aggregate principal amount in September 2019, all of which remains outstanding. Net proceeds of $280 million (excluding accrued interest on this recent offering from March 15, 2020 to, but not including, May 29, 2020, of $2 million payable to us on such date) were used to repay $175 million of the full principal amount and related accrued interest under our term loan facility, which was set to expire in July 2020, as well as repay $105 million of borrowings outstanding under our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and related accrued interest. 

Events that could change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results, potential future acquisitions or divestitures, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or regulatory matters, or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets. 

Tax considerations - The Company recognizes deferred tax balances related to the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries when it expects that it will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner, such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments. We continue to have certain subsidiaries whose earnings have not been deemed permanently reinvested, for which we have been accruing estimates of the tax effects of such repatriation. Excluding these certain subsidiaries, we continue to assert that the historical cumulative earnings for the remainder of our subsidiaries have been reinvested indefinitely, and therefore do not provide deferred taxes on these amounts. If future events, including material changes in estimates of cash, working capital, long-term investment requirements or additional legislation relating to U.S. Tax Reform, necessitate that these earnings be distributed, an additional provision for income and foreign withholding taxes, net of credits, may be necessary. Other potential sources of cash may be through the settlement of intercompany loans or return of capital distributions in a tax-efficient manner.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

Our cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019 totaled $2.1 billion and $887 million, respectively.  

Additionally, we had all of the borrowing capacity available to draw against our $1.25 billion revolving credit facility at both December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Included within cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020 and 2019 are amounts held for regulatory capital adequacy requirements, including $88 million and $114 million, respectively, held within our regulated U.K. entities at December 31, 2020 and 2019. 

Summarized Consolidated Cash Flows 

The following table presents the summarized consolidated cash flow information for the years ended: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

As a result of the acquired TRANZACT collateralized facility (see Item 8, Note 10 — Debt within this filing on Form 10-K), cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included $7 million and $8 million of restricted cash at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which is included within prepaid and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. There was no restricted cash amount held at December 31, 2018. 

Cash Flows From Operating Activities 

Cash flows from operating activities were $1.8 billion for 2020, compared to cash flows from operating activities of $1.1 billion for 2019. The $1.8 billion net cash from operating activities for 2020 included net income of $1.0 billion and $810 million of non-cash adjustments, partially offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $56 million. The $810 million of non-cash adjustments primarily includes depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense. This increase in cash flows from operations as compared to the prior year was primarily due to positive cash flows from our improved working capital position driven by effective management of discretionary spending for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to December 31, 2019. 

The $1.1 billion net cash from operating activities for 2019 included net income of $1.1 billion, adjusted for $798 million of non-cash adjustments, mostly offset by unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities of $790 million. The $798 million of non-cash adjustments primarily included depreciation, amortization and non-cash lease expense. 

Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities 

Cash flows used in investing activities for 2020 and 2019 were $160 million and $1.6 billion, respectively, with the current year primarily driven by capital expenditures and capitalized software additions and an acquisition during the first quarter of 2020. These outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of operations, primarily resulting from the disposal of our Max Matthiessen business. Cash flows in the prior year were primarily driven by the acquisition of TRANZACT during the third quarter of 2019, coupled with capital expenditures and capitalized software additions. 

Cash Flows (Used In)/From Financing Activities 

Cash flows used in financing activities for 2020 were $434 million. The significant financing activities included dividend payments of $346 million and net debt-related payments of $47 million. 

Cash flows from financing activities for 2019 were $397 million. The most significant financing activities included net debt-related proceeds of $958 million, which were partially offset by dividend payments of $329 million and share repurchases of $150 million. 

48 

Indebtedness 

Total debt, total equity, and the capitalization ratio at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

At December 31, 2020, our mandatory debt repayments over the next twelve months include $500 million outstanding on our 5.750% senior notes due 2021, $450 million outstanding on our 3.500% senior notes due 2021 and $22 million outstanding on our collateralized facility assumed as part of our acquisition of TRANZACT. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were in compliance with all financial covenants. 

Fiduciary Funds 

As an intermediary, we hold funds, generally in a fiduciary capacity, for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers. We report premiums, which are held on account of, or due from, clients, as assets with a corresponding liability due to the insurers. Claims held by or due to us, which are due to clients, are also shown as both Fiduciary assets and Fiduciary liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Fiduciary funds are generally required to be kept in regulated bank accounts subject to guidelines which emphasize capital preservation and liquidity; such funds are not available to service the Company’s debt or for other corporate purposes. Notwithstanding the legal relationships with clients and insurers, the Company is entitled to retain investment income earned on fiduciary funds in accordance with industry custom and practice and, in some cases, as supported by agreements with insureds. 

At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had fiduciary funds of $4.3 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. 

Share Repurchase Program 

The Company is authorized to repurchase shares, by way of redemption, and will consider whether to do so from time to time, based on many factors, including market conditions. There are no expiration dates for our repurchase plans or programs. 

On February 26, 2020, the board of directors approved a $251 million increase to the existing share repurchase program, increasing the total remaining authorization to $500 million. See Part II, Item 5 Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company’s share repurchase program. 

With regard to certain prohibitions under the transaction agreement in connection with our pending business combination with Aon, during the year ended December 31, 2020 the Company had no share repurchase activity.  

At December 31, 2020, approximately $500 million remained on the current repurchase authority. The maximum number of shares that could be repurchased based on the closing price of our ordinary shares on December 31, 2020 of $210.68 was 2,373,268. 

Capital Commitments 

The Company has no material commitments for capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use were $223 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Expected capital expenditures for fixed assets and software for internal use are approximately $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We expect cash from operations to adequately provide for these cash needs. 

49 

Dividends 

Total cash dividends of $346 million were paid during the year ended December 31, 2020. In February 2021, the board of directors approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.71 per share ($2.84 per share annualized rate), which will be paid on or about April 15, 2021 to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2021. 

Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information 

As of December 31, 2020, Willis Towers Watson has issued the following debt securities (the ‘notes’): 

a)  

Willis Towers Watson plc (the ‘parent company’) has $500 million senior notes outstanding, which were issued on March 17, 2011; 

b)  

Willis North America Inc. (‘Willis North America’) has approximately $2.9 billion senior notes outstanding, of which $650 million were issued on May 16, 2017, $1.0 billion were issued on September 10, 2018, $1.0 billion were issued on September 10, 2019, and $275 million were issued on May 29, 2020; and 

c)  

Trinity Acquisition plc has approximately $2.1 billion senior notes outstanding, of which $525 million were issued on August 15, 2013, $1.0 billion were issued on March 22, 2016 and €540 million ($609 million) were issued on May 26, 2016, and a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility established on March 7, 2017, on which no balance is currently outstanding.  

The following table presents a summary of the entities that issue each note and those wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company that guarantee each respective note on a joint and several basis. These subsidiaries are all consolidated by the parent company and together with the parent company comprise the ‘Obligor group’. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The notes issued by the parent company, Willis North America and Trinity Acquisition plc: 

•  

rank equally with all of the issuer’s existing and future unsubordinated and unsecured debt;  

•  

rank equally with the issuer’s guarantee of all of the existing senior debt of the Company and the other guarantors, including any debt under the Revolving Credit Facility; 

•  

are senior in right of payment to all of the issuer’s future subordinated debt; and 

•  

are effectively subordinated to all of the issuer’s secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. 

All other subsidiaries of the parent company are non-guarantor subsidiaries (‘the non-guarantor subsidiaries’).  

Each member of the Obligor group has only a stockholder’s claim on the assets of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. This stockholder’s claim is junior to the claims that creditors have against those non-guarantor subsidiaries. Holders of the notes will only be creditors of the Obligor group and not creditors of the non-guarantor subsidiaries. As a result, all of the existing and future liabilities of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors and preferred stockholders, will be structurally senior to the notes. As of and for the periods ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the non-guarantor subsidiaries represented substantially all of the total assets and accounted for substantially all of the total revenue of the Company prior to consolidating adjustments. The non-guarantor subsidiaries have other liabilities, including contingent liabilities that may be significant. Each indenture does not contain any limitations on the amount of additional debt that the Obligor group and the non-guarantor subsidiaries may incur. The amounts of this debt could be substantial, and this debt may be debt of the non-guarantor subsidiaries, in which case this debt would be effectively senior in right of payment to the notes.  

The notes are obligations exclusively of the Obligor group. Substantially all of the Obligor group’s operations are conducted through its non-guarantor subsidiaries. Therefore, the Obligor group’s ability to service its debt, including the notes, is dependent upon the net cash flows of its non-guarantor subsidiaries and their ability to distribute those net cash flows as dividends, loans or other payments to  

50 

the Obligor group. Certain laws restrict the ability of these non-guarantor subsidiaries to pay dividends and make loans and advances to the Obligor group. In addition, such non-guarantor subsidiaries may enter into contractual arrangements that limit their ability to pay dividends and make loans and advances to the Obligor group.  

Intercompany balances and transactions between members of the Obligor group have been eliminated. All intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group and the non-guarantor subsidiaries have been presented in the disclosures below on a net presentation basis, rather than a gross basis, as this better reflects the nature of the intercompany positions and presents the funding or funded position that is to be received or owed. The intercompany balances and transactions between the Obligor group and non-guarantor subsidiaries, presented below, relate to a number of items including loan funding for acquisitions and other purposes, transfers of surplus cash between subsidiary companies, funding provided for working capital purposes, settlement of expense accounts, transactions related to share-based payment arrangements and share issuances, intercompany royalty arrangements, intercompany dividends and intercompany interest. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the intercompany balances of the Obligor group with non-guarantor subsidiaries were net receivables of $500 million and $4.3 billion, respectively, and net payables of $7.6 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. 

No balances or transactions of non-guarantor subsidiaries are presented in the disclosures other than the intercompany items noted above.  

Presented below is certain summarized financial information for the Obligor group. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i) Includes intercompany expense, net of the Obligor group from non-guarantor subsidiaries of $18 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 

In order to assist readers of our consolidated financial statements in understanding the core operating results that Willis Towers Watson’s management uses to evaluate the business and for financial planning purposes, we present the following non-GAAP measures and their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

51 

Management believes that these measures are relevant and provide useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in our industry to provide a baseline for evaluating and comparing our operating performance, and in the case of free cash flow, our liquidity results. 

Within the measures referred to as ‘adjusted’, we adjust for significant items which will not be settled in cash, or which we believe to be items that are not core to our current or future operations. These items include the following: 

•  

Restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses - Management believes it is appropriate to adjust for restructuring costs and transaction and integration expenses when they relate to a specific significant program with a defined set of activities and costs that are not expected to continue beyond a defined period of time, or significant acquisition-related transaction expenses. We believe the adjustment is necessary to present how the Company is performing, both now and in the future when the incurrence of these costs will have concluded. 

•  

Gains and losses on disposals of operations - Adjustment to remove the gain or loss resulting from disposed operations. 

•  

Pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses - Adjustment to remove significant pension settlement and curtailment gains and losses to better present how the Company is performing. 

•  

Abandonment of long-lived asset - Adjustment to remove the depreciation expense resulting from internally-developed software that was abandoned prior to being placed into service. 

•  

Provisions for significant litigation - We will include provisions for litigation matters which we believe are not representative of our core business operations. These amounts are presented net of insurance and other recovery receivables. 

•  

Tax effect of the CARES Act - Relates to the incremental tax expense impact, primarily from the BEAT, generated from electing certain income tax provisions of the CARES Act. 

•  

Tax effects of internal reorganizations - Relates to the U.S. income tax expense resulting from the completion of internal reorganizations of the ownership of certain businesses that reduced the investments held by our U.S.-controlled subsidiaries. 

These non-GAAP measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the information contained within our consolidated financial statements. 

Constant Currency Change and Organic Change 

We evaluate our revenue on an as reported (U.S. GAAP), constant currency and organic basis. We believe presenting constant currency and organic information provides valuable supplemental information regarding our comparable results, consistent with how we evaluate our performance internally. 

•  

Constant Currency Change - Represents the year-over-year change in revenue excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. To calculate this impact, the prior year local currency results are first translated using the current year monthly average exchange rates. The change is calculated by comparing the prior year revenue, translated at the current year monthly average exchange rates, to the current year as reported revenue, for the same period. We believe constant currency measures provide useful information to investors because they provide transparency to performance by excluding the effects that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have on period-over-period comparability given volatility in foreign currency exchange markets. 

•  

Organic Change - Excludes the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as described above and the period-over-period impact of acquisitions and divestitures on current-year revenue. We believe that excluding transaction-related items from our U.S. GAAP financial measures provides useful supplemental information to our investors, and it is important in illustrating what our core operating results would have been had we not included these transaction-related items, since the nature, size and number of these transaction-related items can vary from period to period. 

The constant currency and organic change results, and a reconciliation from the reported results for consolidated revenue, are included in the ‘Consolidated Revenue’ section within this Form 10-K. These measures are also reported by segment in the ‘Segment Revenue’ section within this Form 10-K. 

52 

A reconciliation of the reported change to the constant currency and organic change for the year ended December 31, 2020 from the year ended December 31, 2019 is as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Components of revenue change may not add due to rounding. 

Adjusting for the impacts of foreign currency and acquisitions and disposals in the calculation of our organic activity, our revenue grew by 2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The CRB, IRR and BDA segments had organic revenue growth during the year, while the HCB segment was flat, in part due to the impact of the COVID-19 reduction in demand for our discretionary services. 

Adjusted Operating Income/Margin 

We consider adjusted operating income/margin to be important financial measures, which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. 

Adjusted operating income is defined as income from operations adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted operating income margin is calculated by dividing adjusted operating income by revenue.  

Reconciliations of income from operations to adjusted operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted operating income increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $1.9 billion, from $1.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase resulted primarily from higher revenue, partially offset by higher salaries and benefits expense.  

Adjusted EBITDA/Margin 

We consider adjusted EBITDA/margin to be important financial measures, which are used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations, to benchmark our operating results against our competitors and to evaluate and measure our performance-based compensation plans. 

Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income adjusted for provision for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by revenue. 

53 

Reconciliations of net income to adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

Includes abandonment of long-lived asset of $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2.5 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase resulted primarily from higher revenue and pension income, partially offset by higher salaries and benefits expense. 

Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share 

Adjusted net income is defined as net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results and the related tax effect of those adjustments, the tax effect of the CARES Act and the tax effects of internal reorganizations. This measure is used solely for the purpose of calculating adjusted diluted earnings per share. 

Adjusted diluted earnings per share is defined as adjusted net income divided by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock, diluted. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is used to internally evaluate and assess our core operations and to benchmark our operating results against our competitors. 

54 

Reconciliations of net income attributable to Willis Towers Watson to adjusted diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

For additional information, see the disclosure under Willis Towers Watson Merger-Related Securities Litigation in Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

(ii)   

The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item. 

(iii)  

Per share values and totals may differ due to rounding. 

Our adjusted diluted earnings per share increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to higher revenue and pension income, partially offset by higher salaries and benefits expense. 

Adjusted Income Before Taxes and Adjusted Income Taxes/Tax Rate 

Adjusted income before taxes is defined as income from operations before income taxes adjusted for amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results. Adjusted income before taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate. 

Adjusted income taxes/tax rate is defined as the provision for income taxes adjusted for taxes on certain items of amortization, restructuring costs, transaction and integration expenses, gains and losses on disposals of operations, the tax effect of the CARES Act, the tax effects of internal reorganizations and non-recurring items that, in management’s judgment, significantly affect the period-over-period assessment of operating results, divided by adjusted income before taxes. Adjusted income taxes is used solely for the purpose of calculating the adjusted income tax rate. 

Management believes that the adjusted income tax rate presents a rate that is more closely aligned to the rate that we would incur if not for the reduction of pre-tax income for the adjusted items and the tax effects of our internal reorganizations, which are not core to our current and future operations. 

55 

Reconciliations of income from operations before income taxes to adjusted income before taxes and provision for/(benefit from) income taxes to adjusted income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(i)  

For additional information, see the disclosure under Willis Towers Watson Merger-Related Securities Litigation in Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

(ii)   

The tax effect was calculated using an effective tax rate for each item. 

Our U.S. GAAP tax rates were 23.8% and 18.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The current year effective tax rate is higher primarily due to tax expense of $61 million recognized in connection with the temporary income tax provisions of the CARES Act. During 2020 the Company elected to utilize the higher section 163(j) 50 percent business interest limitation for tax years 2019 and 2020, which allows the Company to utilize additional interest expense. The utilization of additional interest expense reduces our regular tax liability and reduces our ability to utilize foreign tax credits, however, it creates a base erosion minimum tax expense for these tax years. The BEAT effectively applies a 10 percent minimum tax if modified taxable income, as adjusted for base erosion payments, is greater than the regular tax liability for a year. 

Our adjusted income tax rates were 20.8% and 20.3% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The current year adjusted income tax rate is higher than the prior year due to an enacted statutory tax rate change in the U.K., requiring us to remeasure our U.K. deferred tax liabilities and recognize a deferred tax expense of $11 million. 

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow is defined as cash flows from operating activities less cash used to purchase fixed assets and software for internal use. Free cash flow is a liquidity measure and is not meant to represent residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. 

Management believes that free cash flow presents the core operating performance and cash generating capabilities of our business operations. 

Reconciliations of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

56 

The favorable movement in free cash flows in 2020 was primarily due to positive cash flows from our improved working capital position driven by effective management of discretionary spending for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our free cash flows in 2020 were partially offset by transaction and integration expenses, primarily related to the combination with Aon.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

These consolidated financial statements conform to U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our estimates, judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience. Because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process, actual results could differ from those estimates. The areas that we believe include critical accounting policies are revenue recognition, costs to fulfill broking contracts, valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients, discretionary compensation, income taxes, commitments, contingencies and accrued liabilities, pension assumptions, and goodwill and intangible assets. The critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult, subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. These critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption. Different estimates that we could have used, or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur, may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 

Revenue Recognition  

We use significant estimates related to revenue recognition most commonly during our estimation of the transaction prices or where we recognize revenue over time on a proportional performance basis. A brief description of these policies and estimates is included below: 

Estimation of transaction prices — This process occurs most frequently in certain broking transactions. In situations in which our fees are not fixed but are variable, we must estimate the likely commission per policy, taking into account the likelihood of cancellation before the end of the policy. For Medicare broking, Affinity arrangements and proportional treaty reinsurance broking, the commissions to which we will be entitled can vary based on the underlying individual insurance policies that are placed. For Medicare broking and proportional treaty reinsurance in particular, we base the estimates of transaction prices on supportable evidence from an analysis of past transactions, and only include amounts that are probable of being received or not refunded (referred to as applying ‘constraint’ under ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers). In our direct-to-consumer Medicare broking arrangements, the estimate of the total renewal commissions that will be received over the lifetime of the policy requires significant judgment, and will vary based on product type, estimated commission rates, the expected lives of the respective policies and other factors. The Company has applied an actuarial model to account for these uncertainties, which is updated periodically based on actual experience. Each of these processes result in us estimating a transaction price that may be significantly lower than the ultimate amount of commissions we may collect. The transaction price is then adjusted over time as we receive confirmation of our remuneration through receipt of commissions, or as other information becomes available.  

Proportional performance basis over time recognition — Where we recognize revenue on a proportional performance basis, primarily in our consulting and outsourced administration arrangements, the amount we recognize is affected by a number of factors that can change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project, such as the staffing on the engagement and/or the level of client participation. Our periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stages of project completion that, in turn, affect how we recognize revenue. We recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated costs associated with the engagement. Losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. 

Costs to Fulfill Broking Contracts  

For our broking business, the Company must estimate the fulfillment costs incurred during the pre-placement of the broking contracts. These judgments include the following: 

•

Valuation of Billed and Unbilled Receivables from Clients 

We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from a client’s failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered, which are recorded in other operating expenses. We also maintain allowances related to our unbilled receivables for such items as expected realization or client disputes, the related provision for which is recorded as a reduction to revenue. Our allowance policy is based in part on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our write-off history. However, facts and circumstances, such as the average length of time the receivables are past due, general market conditions at the time we perform the work, current economic trends and our clients’ ability to pay, may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables. 

Discretionary Compensation 

Our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year after our annual operating results are finalized. 

An estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process. Estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted, if necessary, by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre-bonus profitability for the year. Our estimated annual profitability, coupled with the projected seasonality inherent in our business, represent significant estimates during our interim quarterly close process.  

Income Taxes 

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of changes in tax rates is recognized in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company adjusts valuation allowances to measure deferred tax assets at the amounts considered realizable in future periods when the Company’s facts and assumptions change. In making such determinations, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operating results. We place more reliance on evidence that is objectively verifiable. 

Commitments, Contingencies and Accrued Liabilities 

We have established provisions against various actual and potential claims, lawsuits and other proceedings relating principally to alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance and reinsurance and the provision of consulting services in the ordinary course of business. Such provisions cover claims that have been reported but not paid and also claims that have been incurred but not reported. These provisions are established based on actuarial estimates together with individual case reviews and are believed to be adequate in the light of current information and legal advice. In certain cases, where a range of loss exists, we accrue the minimum amount in the range if no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. 

See Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies in Item 8 within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Pension Assumptions 

We maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees in several countries, with the most significant defined benefit plans offered in the U.S. and U.K. Our disclosures in Note 12 — Retirement Benefits contain additional information about our other less significant but material retirement plans. Within our critical accounting policy discussion, we have excluded analysis for plans outside of those noted in the description below, as any variance of recorded information based on management’s estimates would be immaterial. 

Descriptions of our U.S. and U.K. plans, which comprise 90% of our projected benefit obligations and 93% of our plan assets, are below: 

United States 

Legacy Willis – This plan was frozen in 2009. Approximately one-quarter of the Legacy Willis employees in the United States have a frozen accrued benefit under this plan. 

58 

Willis Towers Watson Plan – Substantially all U.S. employees are eligible to participate in this plan. Benefits are provided under a stable value pension plan design. The original stable value design came into effect on January 1, 2012. Existing plan participants prior to July 1, 2017 earn benefits without having to make employee contributions, and all newly eligible employees after that date are required to contribute 2% of pay on an after-tax basis to participate in the plan. 

United Kingdom 

Legacy Willis – This plan covers approximately one-quarter of the Legacy Willis employees in the United Kingdom. The plan is now closed to new entrants. New employees in the United Kingdom are offered the opportunity to join a defined contribution plan. 

Legacy Towers Watson – Benefit accruals earned under the Legacy Watson Wyatt defined benefit plan (predominantly pension benefits) ceased on February 28, 2015, although benefits earned prior to January 1, 2008 retain a link to salary until the employee leaves the Company. Benefit accruals earned under the legacy Towers Perrin defined benefit plan (predominantly lump sum benefits) were frozen on March 31, 2008. All participants now accrue defined contribution benefits. 

Legacy Miller – The plan provides retirement benefits based on members’ salaries at the point at which they ceased to accrue benefits under the scheme. 

The determination of the Company’s obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that, given the longevity of the plans, are long-term in focus. A change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our projected benefit obligation. However, certain of these changes, such as changes in the discount rates and other actuarial assumptions, are not recognized immediately in net income, but are instead recorded in other comprehensive income. The accumulated gains and losses not yet recognized in net income are amortized into net income as a component of the net periodic benefit cost/(income) over the average remaining service period or average remaining life expectancy, as appropriate, of the plan’s participants to the extent that the net gains or losses as of the beginning of the year exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation. 

Willis Towers Watson considers several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions, including economic forecasts, relevant benchmarks, historical trends, portfolio composition and peer company comparisons. These assumptions, used to determine our pension liabilities and pension expense, are reviewed annually by senior management and changed when appropriate. A discount rate will be changed annually if underlying rates have moved, whereas an expected long-term return on assets will be changed less frequently as longer-term trends in asset returns emerge or long-term target asset allocations are revised. To calculate the discount rate, we use the granular approach to determining service cost and interest cost. The expected rate of return assumptions for all plans are supported by an analysis of the weighted-average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments. Other material assumptions include rates of participant mortality, and the expected long-term rates of compensation and pension increases. 

Funding is based on actuarially determined contributions and is limited to amounts that are currently deductible for tax purposes, or as agreed to with the plan trustees for the U.K. plans. Since funding calculations are based on different measurements than those used for accounting purposes, pension contributions are not equal to net periodic benefit cost. 

We recorded a combined $201 million net periodic benefit income for our U.S. and U.K. plans for the year ended December 31, 2020. For the U.S. and U.K. plans, the following table presents our estimated net periodic benefit income for 2021 and the impact to both plans of a 0.25% increase and decrease to both the expected return on assets (‘EROA’) and the discount rate assumptions; and the projected benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 and the impact of a 0.25% increase and decrease to the discount rates:

Economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously, and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear. 

Goodwill and Intangible Assets — Impairment Review 

In applying the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of acquisition, with the remainder recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets are initially valued at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise. Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. The fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of October 1, and whenever indicators of impairment arise. 

Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level, and the Company had eight reporting units as of October 1, 2020. 

During fiscal year 2020, the Company performed the impairment test for all reporting units. Each of the reporting unit’s estimated fair values were in excess of their carrying values, and we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill. To perform the test, we used valuation techniques to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit that are under the income and/or market approaches of valuation methods. Under the discounted cash flow method, an income approach, the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt-free after-tax cash flows for a finite period of years. Key estimates in this approach were internal financial projection estimates prepared by management, assessment of business risk, and expected rates of return on capital. The guideline company method, a market approach, develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies. Key estimates and determination of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies, obtaining forecast revenue and EBITDA estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics. Under the similar transactions method, a market approach, actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units are used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units.
