Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

As of March 31, 2021, our long-term debt totaled $9.21 billion. We have no interest rate exposure to rate changes on our fixed rate debt, which totaled $6.86 billion as of March 31, 2021. We do have interest rate exposure with respect to the $2.35 billion of our variable interest rate debt outstanding as of March 31, 2021. A 50 basis point increase in interest rates would impact our expected annual interest expense for the next 12 months by approximately $11.7 million.
