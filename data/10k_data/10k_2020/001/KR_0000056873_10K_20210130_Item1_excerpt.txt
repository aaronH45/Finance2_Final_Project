ITEM 1.

BUSINESS.

​

The Kroger Co. (the “Company” or “Kroger”) was founded in 1883 and incorporated in 1902. As of January 30, 2021, we are one of the largest retailers in the world based on annual sales. We also manufacture and process some of the food for sale in our supermarkets. We maintain a web site (www.thekrogerco.com) that includes the Kroger Fact Book and other additional information about the Company. Kroger’s website and any reports or other information made available by Kroger through its website are not part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available through our web site, free of charge, our annual reports on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and our interactive data files, including amendments. These forms are available as soon as reasonably practicable after we have filed them with, or furnished them electronically to, the SEC.

​

Our revenues are predominately earned and cash is generated as consumer products are sold to customers in our stores, fuel centers and via our online platforms. We earn income predominantly by selling products at price levels that produce revenues in excess of the costs to make these products available to our customers. Such costs include procurement and distribution costs, facility occupancy and operational costs and overhead expenses. Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. All references to 2020, 2019 and 2018 are to the fiscal years ended January 30, 2021, February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019, respectively, unless specifically indicated otherwise.

​

STORES

​

As of January 30, 2021, Kroger operated, either directly or through its subsidiaries, 2,742 supermarkets under a variety of local banner names, of which 2,255 had pharmacies and 1,596 had fuel centers. We offer Pickup (also referred to as ClickList®) and Harris Teeter ExpressLane™— personalized, order online, pick up at the store services — at 2,223 of our supermarkets and provide home delivery service to substantially all of Kroger households. Approximately 51% of our supermarkets were operated in Company-owned facilities, including some Company-owned buildings on leased land. Our stores operate under a variety of banners that have strong local ties and brand recognition. Fuel sales are an important part of our revenue, net earnings and loyalty offering. Our fuel strategy is to include a fuel center at each of our supermarket locations when it is feasible and it is expected to be profitable. Each fuel center typically includes 5 to 10 islands of fuel dispensers and storage tanks with capacity for 40,000 to 50,000 gallons of fuel. Supermarkets are generally operated under one of the following formats: combination food and drug stores (“combo stores”); multi-department stores; marketplace stores; or price impact warehouses.

​

The combo store is the primary food store format. They typically draw customers from a 2-2.5 mile radius. We believe this format is successful because the stores are large enough to offer the specialty departments that customers desire for one-stop shopping, including natural food and organic sections, pharmacies, general merchandise, pet centers and high-quality perishables such as fresh seafood and organic produce.

​

Multi-department stores are significantly larger in size than combo stores. In addition to the departments offered at a typical combo store, multi-department stores sell a wide selection of general merchandise items such as apparel, home fashion and furnishings, outdoor living, electronics, automotive products and toys.

​

Marketplace stores are smaller in size than multi-department stores. They offer full-service grocery, pharmacy and health and beauty care departments as well as an expanded perishable offering and general merchandise area that includes apparel, home goods and toys.

​

3 

Price impact warehouse stores offer a “no-frills, low cost” warehouse format and feature everyday low prices plus promotions for a wide selection of grocery and health and beauty care items. Quality meat, dairy, baked goods and fresh produce items provide a competitive advantage. The average size of a price impact warehouse store is similar to that of a combo store.

​

SEGMENTS

​

We operate supermarkets and multi-department stores throughout the United States.  Our retail operations, which represent 97% of our consolidated sales, is our only reportable segment. We aggregate our operating divisions into one reportable segment due to the operating divisions having similar economic characteristics with similar long-term financial performance. In addition, our operating divisions offer customers similar products, have similar distribution methods, operate in similar regulatory environments, purchase the majority of the merchandise for retail sale from similar (and in many cases identical) vendors on a coordinated basis from a centralized location, serve similar types of customers, and are allocated capital from a centralized location. Our operating divisions are organized primarily on a geographical basis so that the operating division management team can be responsive to local needs of the operating division and can execute company strategic plans and initiatives throughout the locations in their operating division. This geographical separation is the primary differentiation between these retail operating divisions. The geographical basis of organization reflects how the business is managed and how our Chief Executive Officer, who acts as our chief operating decision maker, assesses performance internally. All of our operations are domestic. Revenues, profits and losses and total assets are shown in our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 below.

​

MERCHANDISING AND MANUFACTURING

​

Our Brands products play an important role in our merchandising strategy. Our supermarkets, on average, stock over 15,000 private label items. Our Brands products are primarily produced and sold in three “tiers.” Private Selection® is one of our premium quality brands, offering customers culinary foods and ingredients that deliver amazing eating experiences. The Kroger® brand, which represents the majority of our private label items, is designed to consistently satisfy and delight customers with quality products that exceed or meet the national brand in taste and efficacy, as well as with unique and differentiated products. Big K®, Check This Out…® and Heritage Farm® are some of our value brands, designed to deliver good quality at a very affordable price. In addition to our three “tiers,” Our Brands offers customers a variety of natural and organic products with Simple Truth® and Simple Truth Organic®. Both Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic are free from a defined list of artificial ingredients that customers have told us they do not want in their food, and the Simple Truth Organic products are USDA certified organic.

​

Approximately 29% of Our Brands units and 40% of the grocery category Our Brands units sold in our supermarkets are produced in our food production plants; the remaining Our Brands items are produced to our strict specifications by outside manufacturers. We perform a “make or buy” analysis on Our Brands products and decisions are based upon a comparison of market-based transfer prices versus open market purchases. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 35 food production plants. These plants consisted of 16 dairies, 9 deli or bakery plants, five grocery product plants, two beverage plants, one meat plant and two cheese plants.

​

SEASONALITY

​

The majority of our revenues are generally not seasonal in nature. However, revenues tend to be higher during the major holidays throughout the year. Additionally, certain significant events including inclement weather systems, particularly winter storms, tend to affect our sales trends.

​

HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

​

Our People 

​

We want Kroger to be a place our customers love to shop and associates love to work. This is why we create working environments where associates feel encouraged and supported to be their best selves every day. As of January 30, 2021, Kroger employed approximately 465,000 full- and part-time employees. With these nearly half a million associates serving more than nine million customers every day, our people are essential to our success, and we focus intentionally on attracting, developing and engaging a diverse workforce that represents the communities we serve. We have long been guided by our core values – Honesty, Integrity, Respect, Safety, Diversity and Inclusion.

Attracting & Developing Our Talent

​

We recognize that our people are our most important asset. To deliver on our customers’ experiences, we continually improve how we attract and retain talent. In addition to competitive wages, quality benefits, and a safe work environment, we offer a broad range of employment opportunities for workers of all ages and aspirations. During the past decade, Kroger has added 100,000 new jobs in communities across America. Many supermarket roles offer opportunities to learn new skills, grow and advance careers — inside or outside our family of companies. 

​

Associates at all levels of the Company have access to training and education programs to build their skills and prepare for the roles they want. In 2021, we expect to spend approximately $125 million on training our associates through onboarding, leadership development programs, and programs designed to upskill associates across the Company. We continue to invest in new platforms and applications to make learning more accessible to our associates. 

​

Beyond our own programs, associates can take advantage of our tuition reimbursement benefit, which offers up to $3,500 annually — $21,000 over the course of employment — toward continuing education. These funds can be applied to education programs like certifications, associate or graduate degrees. Kroger has invested more than $15 million in this program since it launched in 2018. 

​

Rewarding Our Associates

​

We care about our associates’ overall well-being — physical, financial and emotional — and provide wages and benefits that help associates take care of themselves and their families. Between 2018 and 2020, we invested an incremental $800 million in associate wages. Since 2018, Kroger’s average retail hourly wage increased to over $15 per hour. Including benefit equivalents, the average rate surpasses $20 per hour.

​

Promoting Diversity, Equity & Inclusion

​

Diversity and inclusion have been among Kroger’s values for decades. We strive to reflect the communities we serve and foster a culture that empowers everyone to be their true self, inspires collaboration, and feeds the human spirit. During the past year, we have taken a very thoughtful and purposeful approach to enact meaningful change and develop what we believe are the right actions to achieve true and lasting equality. Our new Framework for Action: Diversity, Equity & Inclusion plan reflects our desire to redefine, deepen, and advance our commitment, mobilizing our people, passion, scale and resources. The following summarizes our framework: Create a More Inclusive Culture; Develop Diverse Talent; Advance Diverse Partnerships; Advance Equitable Communities; Deeply Listen and Report Progress.

​

Creating a Safe Environment

​

Our associates’ safety is a top priority and it is one of our core values. Since March of 2020, we have made significant investments to reward and safeguard our associates and customers. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we activated our Pandemic Preparedness Plan and Business Resilience Plan to help protect frontline associates, stay open to serve our customers and communities, and anticipate and adapt to critical needs in a rapidly changing situation. Since then, we have enacted more than 30 policy changes to help keep our associates safe, including offering paid emergency leave to those most directly affected by COVID-19, providing personal protective equipment, offering free testing through our COVID-19 at-home test kits, and promoting physical distancing in our locations. We are committed to supporting the health and well-being of our associates by providing a robust range of physical and mental health benefits and offering an incentive to associates who choose to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

​

Beyond the pandemic, we prioritize providing the right safety training and equipment, safe working conditions and resources to maintain and improve associates’ well-being. Through our strategy to set clear expectations, routine monitoring, and regular communication and engagement, we reduce the number of injuries and accidents that happen in our workplace.

​

5 

We track health and safety metrics centrally for an enterprise-wide view of issues, trends and opportunities and monitor associate injury performance including total injuries, Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) injury rates, and lost-time injuries, as well as customer injury metrics like slip-and-fall injuries. We also track the completion of required training for associates and we regularly share these metrics with leaders and relevant team members to inform management decisions.

​

Supporting Labor Relations

​

A majority of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements negotiated with local unions affiliated with one of several different international unions. There are approximately 350 such agreements, usually with terms of three to five years. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance on compensation packages that provide solid wages as well as good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits while also keeping our family of companies competitive in the market.
