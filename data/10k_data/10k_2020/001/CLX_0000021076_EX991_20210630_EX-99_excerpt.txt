EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

Clorox is a leading multinational manufacturer and marketer of consumer and professional products with fiscal year 2021 net sales of $7,341 and about 9,000 employees worldwide as of June 30, 2021. Clorox sells its products primarily through mass retailers, grocery outlets, warehouse clubs, dollar stores, home hardware centers, drug, pet and military stores, third-party and owned e-commerce channels, and distributors. Clorox markets some of the most trusted and recognized consumer brand names, including its namesake bleach and cleaning products; Pine-Sol® cleaners; Liquid-Plumr® clog removers; Poett® home care products; Fresh Step® cat litter; Glad® bags and wraps; Kingsford® grilling products; Hidden Valley® dressings, dips, seasonings and sauces; Brita® water-filtration systems and filters; Burt’s Bees® natural personal care products; and RenewLife®, Rainbow Light®, Natural Vitality®, and NeoCell® vitamins, minerals and supplements. The Company also markets industry-leading products and technologies for professional customers, including those sold under the CloroxPro™ and Clorox Healthcare® brand names. The Company has operations in more than 25 countries or territories and sells its products in more than 100 markets.

The Company primarily markets its leading brands in midsized categories considered to be financially attractive. Most of the Company’s products compete with other nationally advertised brands within each category and with “private label” brands.

The Company operates through strategic business units (SBUs) that are also the Company’s operating segments. These SBUs are then aggregated into four reportable segments: Health and Wellness, Household, Lifestyle and International. These four reportable segments consist of the following:

•Health and Wellness consists of cleaning products, professional products, and vitamins, minerals and supplement products mainly marketed and sold in the U.S. Products within this segment include cleaning products such as laundry additives and home care products, primarily under the Clorox®, Clorox2®, Scentiva®, Pine-Sol®, Liquid-Plumr®, Tilex®, and Formula 409® brands; professional cleaning and disinfecting products under the CloroxPro™, Clorox Healthcare®, and Clorox® Total 360® brands; professional food service products under the Hidden Valley® brand; and vitamins, minerals and supplement products under the RenewLife®, Natural Vitality®, NeoCell®, and Rainbow Light® brands.

•Household consists of cat litter products, bags and wraps, and grilling products marketed and sold in the U.S. Products within this segment include cat litter products under the Fresh Step®, Scoop Away® and Ever Clean® brands, bags and wraps under the Glad® brand; and grilling products under the Kingsford® and Kingsford® Match Light® brands.

•Lifestyle consists of food, natural personal care products, and water-filtration marketed and sold in the U.S. Products within this segment include dressings, dips, seasonings and sauces, primarily under the Hidden Valley® brand; natural personal care products under the Burt’s Bees® brand; and water-filtration systems and filters under the Brita® brand.

1

•International consists of products sold outside the U.S. Products within this segment include laundry additives; home care products; water-filtration systems and filters; digestive health products; grilling products; cat litter products; food products; bags and wraps; natural personal care products; and professional cleaning and disinfecting products marketed primarily under the Clorox®, Ayudin®, Clorinda®, Poett®, Pine-Sol®, Glad®, Brita®, RenewLife®, Ever Clean® and Burt’s Bees® brands.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This Executive Overview, the succeeding sections of MD&A and Exhibit 99.2 may include certain financial measures that are not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). These measures, which are referred to as non-GAAP measures, are listed below:

•Free cash flow and free cash flow as a percentage of net sales. Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures.

•Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin (the ratio of EBIT to net sales)

•Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and other similar non-cash charges (such as non-cash asset impairment charges and other non-cash, non-recurring gains or losses) (Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in our Credit Agreement) to interest expense ratio (Interest Coverage ratio) 

•Economic profit (EP) is defined by the Company as earnings before income taxes, excluding non-cash U.S. GAAP items (such as restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges, non-cash gains or losses), and interest expense; less income taxes (calculated based on the Company’s effective tax rate excluding the identified U.S. GAAP items), and less after tax profit attributable to noncontrolling interests, and less a capital charge (calculated as average capital employed multiplied by a cost of capital rate).

•Organic sales growth / (decrease) is defined as net sales growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and any acquisitions and divestitures.

For a discussion of these measures and the reasons management believes they are useful to investors, refer to “Summary of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. To the extent applicable, this MD&A and Exhibit 99.2 include reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Fiscal Year 2021 Financial Highlights

A detailed discussion of strategic goals, key initiatives and results of operations is included below. Key fiscal year 2021 financial results are summarized as follows:

•The Company’s fiscal year 2021 net sales increased by 9% to $7,341 from $6,721 in fiscal year 2020, reflecting higher shipments across all reportable segments primarily driven by higher shipments due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 

•Gross margin decreased by 200 basis points to 43.6% in fiscal year 2021 from 45.6% in fiscal year 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by higher manufacturing and logistics costs and increased commodity costs, partially offset by higher volume, cost savings, and lower trade promotion spending.

•The Company reported earnings before income taxes of $900 in fiscal year 2021, compared to $1,185 in fiscal year 2020. The Company reported earnings attributable to Clorox of $710 in fiscal year 2021, compared to $939 in fiscal year 2020. 

•The Company delivered diluted net earnings per share (EPS) of $5.58 in fiscal year 2021, a decrease of approximately 24%, or $1.78, from fiscal year 2020 diluted net EPS of $7.36. The decrease was primarily due to the non-cash impairment charges on assets held by the Vitamins, Minerals, and Supplements (VMS) business, higher manufacturing and logistics costs, and increased advertising investments, partially offset by net sales growth and the remeasurement gain recognized on the previously held equity interest in the Saudi joint venture.

•EP decreased by 5% to $672 in fiscal year 2021, compared to $706 in fiscal year 2020 (refer to the reconciliation of EP to earnings before income taxes in Exhibit 99.2).

2

•The Company’s net cash provided by operations was $1,276 in fiscal year 2021, compared to $1,546 in fiscal year 2020. Free cash flow was $945 or 12.9% of net sales in fiscal year 2021, compared to $1,292 or 19.2% of net sales in fiscal year 2020 (refer to the reconciliation of net cash provided by operations to free cash flow in “Financial Position and Liquidity - Investing - Free Cash Flow”).

•The Company paid $558 in cash dividends to stockholders in fiscal year 2021, compared to $533 in cash dividends in fiscal year 2020. In June 2021, the Company announced an increase of 5% in its quarterly cash dividend from the prior year.

•In fiscal year 2021, the Company repurchased 4,758 thousand shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $905 under its two stock repurchase programs. 

Strategic Goals and Initiatives

As announced in 2019, the IGNITE strategy is intended to accelerate innovation in key areas of the business to drive growth and deliver value for both the Company's shareholders and society. Specifically, IGNITE focuses on four strategic choices to deliver purpose-driven growth: Fuel Growth, Innovate Experiences, Reimagine Work and Evolve Portfolio, and goals for environmental, social and governance, performance in the areas of Planet, Product, People and Governance also are integrated into the strategy. The Company’s long-term financial goals reflected in IGNITE include annual net sales growth of 3% to 5% — increased from 2% to 4% in 2021 — annual EBIT margin expansion of 25 to 50 basis points and annual free cash flow of 11% to 13%. 

Recent Events Related to COVID-19

For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause economic and social disruptions that led to ongoing uncertainties. Demand for products across the Company portfolio remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels even while U.S. consumers continued to adjust some behaviors as vaccination rates improved. The pandemic also contributed to a more pronounced inflationary environment in the back half of the fiscal year, marked by higher manufacturing and logistics costs as well as increased commodity costs. 

Throughout fiscal year 2021, our priorities remained the Company’s guiding principles:

•Continuing to take steps to enhance the well-being of the Company’s global workforce and communities and to protect public health.

•Increasing capacity to provide needed products, primarily disinfecting and cleaning to help keep people safe, while sustaining the Company’s manufacturing operations and safety standards.

•Addressing supply-chain disruptions and volatility in commodity costs and foreign exchange markets.

As the world moves into new phases of the pandemic, the Company will continue to focus on these priorities, while continuing to strive to serve people as consumer behaviors evolve inside and outside the home.

The extent of COVID-19’s effect on the Company’s operational and financial performance in the future will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic in different countries, including the emergence of COVID-19 variants for which vaccines may not be currently effective, the Company’s continued ability to manufacture and distribute its products, any future government actions affecting consumers and the economy in general, and timing and effectiveness of global vaccines, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict considering the rapidly evolving landscape as the Company continues to expect a variable operating environment going forward.

For further discussion of the possible impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial conditions and results of operations, see “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Unless otherwise noted, MD&A compares results of operations from fiscal year 2021 to fiscal year 2020, with percentage and basis point calculations based on rounded numbers, except for per share data and the effective tax rate. Discussions of fiscal year 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between fiscal years 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Exhibit 99.1 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) This represents the net impact on net sales growth from pricing actions, mix and other factors.

(2) Organic sales growth is defined as net sales growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and any acquisitions and divestitures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for reconciliation of organic sales growth to net sales growth, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

(3) Organic volume represents volume excluding the effect of any acquisitions and divestitures. In the year ended June 30, 2021, the volume impact of acquisitions was 7% and 1% for International and Total Company, respectively.

Net sales in fiscal year 2021 increased by 9%, reflecting higher shipments across all reportable segments primarily driven by higher shipments due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased by 7% versus the prior period. The variance between volume growth and net sales growth was primarily due to the impact of lower trade promotion spending.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Gross margin decreased by 200 basis points in fiscal year 2021 from 45.6% to 43.6%. The decrease was primarily driven by higher manufacturing and logistics costs and increased commodity costs, partially offset by higher volume, cost savings, and lower trade promotion spending.

4

Expenses

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Selling and administrative expenses, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 70 basis points in fiscal year 2021. The dollar increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased investments in several growth opportunities. Fiscal year 2021 also reflects lower incentive compensation expenses as compared to the prior year, consistent with the Company's performance-based compensation philosophy. 

Advertising costs, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 80 basis points in fiscal year 2021. The increase in advertising expenses reflected the Company’s continued support behind its brands. The Company’s U.S. retail advertising spend as a percentage of net sales was 12% for fiscal year 2021 and 11% for fiscal year 2020, respectively.

Research and development costs, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 20 basis points in fiscal year 2021, but were essentially flat in terms of dollars. The Company continues to invest behind product innovation and cost savings. 

Goodwill, trademark and other asset impairments, Interest expense, Other (income) expense, net, and the effective tax rate on earnings

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Goodwill, trademark and other asset impairments of $329 in fiscal year 2021 reflect non-cash impairment charges related to goodwill, trademarks, and other assets held by the VMS business (included within the Health and Wellness segment). See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the impairments recorded.

Interest expense was essentially flat in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020.

Other (income) expense, net was ($72) and ($10) in fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2020, respectively. The variance was primarily due to the one-time, non-cash remeasurement gain recognized from the Company’s previously held equity interest in the Saudi joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The effective tax rate on earnings (losses) was 20.1% and 20.8% in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Diluted net earnings per share

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) decreased by $1.78, or 24%, in fiscal year 2021, primarily due to the non-cash impairment charges on assets held by the VMS business, higher manufacturing and logistics costs, and increased advertising investments, partially offset by net sales growth and the remeasurement gain recognized on the previously held equity interest in the Saudi joint venture.

SEGMENT RESULTS

The following presents the results of the Company’s reportable segments and certain unallocated costs reflected in Corporate (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of segment results to consolidated results):

Health and Wellness

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020: Volume and net sales increased by 7%, and 8%, respectively, and earnings before income taxes decreased by 60%, during fiscal year 2021. The volume and net sales growth reflected higher shipments in all strategic business units due to greater demand inside and outside of the home. The variance between volume and net sales was primarily due to lower trader promotion, partially offset by unfavorable mix. The decrease in earnings before income taxes in the current period was primarily due to the non-cash impairment charges on assets held by the VMS business, higher manufacturing and logistics costs, advertising investment, and selling and administrative expenses, partially offset by net sales growth. 

Household

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020: Volume, net sales and earnings before income taxes increased by 9%, 10% and 8%, respectively, during fiscal year 2021. The volume growth was primarily driven by higher shipments in Grilling from higher consumer demand. The increase in earnings before income taxes was mainly due to net sales growth and cost savings, partially offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs, commodity costs, and advertising investments.

Lifestyle

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020:Volume and net sales increased by 6%, and earnings before income taxes were essentially flat during fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. Both volume growth and net sales growth were primarily driven by higher shipments of Food and Brita water filtration products mainly due to greater demand by consumers and strategic brand investments. The Natural Personal Care business declined due to lower store traffic associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Earnings before income taxes were essentially flat due to net sales growth, offset by higher manufacturing and logistics costs.

6

International

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Fiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020: Volume, net sales and earnings before income taxes increased by 9%, 14% and 73%, respectively, during fiscal year 2021. The volume increase was primarily driven by higher shipments from ongoing demand for disinfecting and other household products in every geographic region, as well as the impact of the Saudi joint venture acquisition. The variance between volume and net sales was mainly due to favorable mix and the benefit of price increases implemented to offset inflation, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in earnings before income taxes was primarily due to the remeasurement gain recognized on the previously held equity interest in the Saudi joint venture.

Argentina

The business environment in Argentina continues to be challenging due to significant volatility in Argentina’s currency, high inflation, an economic recession, and impacts of COVID-19 and temporary price controls. The Company operates in Argentina through certain wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively, “Clorox Argentina”). Clorox Argentina manufactures products at two plants that it owns and operates across Argentina. 

Effective July 1, 2018, under the requirements of U.S. GAAP, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy, and as a result, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in Argentina. Consequently, gains and losses from non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities of Clorox Argentina are recognized in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings. 

As of September 2019, the government of Argentina reinstated foreign exchange controls in response to further declines in the value of the Argentine peso, limiting the Company’s ability to convert Argentine pesos to U.S. dollars and transfer U.S. dollars outside of Argentina. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the net asset position, excluding goodwill, of Clorox Argentina was $48 and $44, respectively. Of these net assets, cash balances were approximately $11 and $19 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net sales from Clorox Argentina represented approximately 2% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 

Volatility in the exchange rate is expected to continue, which, along with competition, changes in the retail, labor and macro-economic environment, and implemented and future additional legal limitations instituted to restrict foreign exchange transactions, as well as government price controls, could have an adverse impact on Clorox Argentina’s liquidity, net sales, net earnings, cash flows and net monetary asset position. The Company is closely monitoring developments in Argentina and continues to take steps intended to mitigate the adverse conditions, but there can be no assurances that these actions will be able to mitigate these conditions as they may occur.

Corporate

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Corporate includes certain non-allocated administrative costs, interest income, interest expense and various other non-operating income and expenses. 

Fiscal year 2021 versus fiscal year 2020: The decrease in losses before income taxes was primarily driven by lower employee incentive compensation expenses, consistent with the Company's performance-based compensation philosophy.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND LIQUIDITY

Management’s discussion and analysis of the Company’s financial position and liquidity describes its consolidated operating, investing and financing activities from operations, contractual obligations and off-balance sheet arrangements.

The Company’s cash position includes amounts held by foreign subsidiaries and, as a result, the repatriation of certain cash balances from some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries could result in additional tax costs. However, these cash balances are generally available without legal restriction to fund local business operations. In addition, a portion of the Company’s cash balance is held in U.S. dollars by foreign subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency. Such U.S. dollar balances are reported on the foreign subsidiaries’ books, in their functional currency, with the impact from foreign currency exchange rate differences recorded in Other (income) expense, net. 

The Company’s financial condition and liquidity remained strong as of June 30, 2021. The following table summarizes cash activities for the years ended June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operations was $1,276 in fiscal year 2021, compared with $1,546 in fiscal year 2020. The year-over-year decrease was driven by an increase in net working capital (higher inventories in the current year primarily due to increased production and higher payables in the current period due to the extension of payment terms with suppliers and increased production levels primarily to improve inventory availability, offset by cash inflows from collections from higher sales in the last quarter of the prior fiscal year). The decrease was also driven by higher employee incentive compensation payments related to the Company's strong 2020 fiscal year results and due to the timing of tax payments. 

Payment Terms Extension and Supply Chain Financing

The Company initiated the extension of its payment terms with its suppliers in the second half of fiscal year 2020 in order to improve working capital as part of and to fund the IGNITE strategy and in keeping with evolving market practices. As part of those efforts, the Company has arranged for a global financial institution to offer a voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) program for the benefit of the Company’s suppliers. Leveraging the Company’s credit rating, the SCF program enables suppliers to directly contract with the financial institution to receive payment from the financial institution prior to the payment terms between the Company and the supplier, by selling the Company’s payables to the financial institution. The participation in the program is at the sole discretion of the supplier and the Company has no economic interest in a supplier's decision to enter into the agreement and has no direct financial relationship with the financial institution. Once a supplier elects to participate in the SCF program and reaches an agreement with the financial institution, the supplier elects which individual Company invoices to sell to the financial institution. The terms of the Company’s payment obligations are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the program. 

All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the associated payments are included in operating activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable and accrued expenses was $152 and $6, respectively.

Investing Activities

Net cash used for investing activities was $452 in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $252 in fiscal year 2020. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to the acquisition of additional interest in the Company's Saudi joint venture and higher capital spending to increase manufacturing capacity.

Capital expenditures were $331 and $254 in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net sales was 4.5% and 3.8% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The current year-over-year increase was due to expanding production capacity to address elevated demand for and improve availability of the Company’s products and to support long-term growth opportunities. 

8

Free cash flow

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Financing Activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $1,391 in fiscal year 2021, compared with $523 in fiscal year 2020. The year-over-year increase was mainly due to higher treasury stock repurchases in the current fiscal year and net cash sourced from borrowings in the prior fiscal year.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

The Company maintains a $1,200 revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) that matures in November 2024. Global financial markets have experienced a significant increase in volatility due to heightened uncertainty over the adverse economic impact caused by COVID-19. Notwithstanding these potential adverse market conditions, the Company believes it will have the funds necessary to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs based on our anticipated ability to generate positive cash flows from operations in the future, access to capital markets enabled by our strong short-term and long-term credit ratings, and current borrowing availability under the credit agreement.

As previously announced, Clorox plans to invest approximately $500 million over the next five years in its digital capabilities and for productivity enhancements. These investments are expected to be funded through cash generated from operations.

The Company may consider other transactions that require the issuance of additional long- and/or short-term debt or other securities to finance acquisitions, repurchase stock, refinance debt or fund other activities for general business purposes. Such transactions could require funds in excess of the Company’s current cash levels and available credit lines, and the Company’s access to or cost of such additional funds could be adversely affected by any decrease in credit ratings, which were the following as of June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Credit Arrangements

There were no borrowings under the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, and the Company believes that borrowings under the Credit Agreement are and will continue to be available for general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement includes certain restrictive covenants and limitations. The primary restrictive covenant is a minimum ratio of 4.0 calculated as total earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash asset impairment charges and other non-cash, non-recurring gains or losses (Consolidated EBITDA) to total interest expense for the trailing four quarters (Interest Coverage ratio), as defined and described in the Credit Agreement.

9

The following table sets forth the calculation of the Interest Coverage ratio as of June 30, 2021, using Consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four quarters, as contractually defined in the Credit Agreement:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Includes goodwill, trademark, other asset impairments and other non-cash charges recorded impacting the VMS and Professional Products SBUs (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) 

(2) Non-recurring, non-cash gain from the remeasurement of the Company’s previously held investment in its Saudi joint venture (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants and limitations in the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2021, and anticipates being in compliance with all restrictive covenants for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to monitor the financial markets and assess its ability to fully draw on its Credit Agreement, and currently expects it will continue to have access to borrowing under the Credit Agreement. 

As of June 30, 2021, the Company maintained $35 of foreign and other credit lines, of which $5 was outstanding and the remainder of $30 was available for borrowing. 

As of June 30, 2020, the Company maintained $38 of foreign and other credit lines, of which $3 was outstanding and the remainder of $35 was available for borrowing.

Short-term Borrowings

The Company’s notes and loans payable primarily consist of U.S. commercial paper issued by the parent company and any borrowings under the Credit Agreement. These short-term borrowings have stated maturities of less than one year and provide supplemental funding for supporting operations. The level of U.S. commercial paper borrowings generally fluctuates depending upon the amount and timing of operating cash flows and payments for items such as dividends, income taxes, stock repurchases and pension contributions. The average balance of short-term borrowings outstanding was $0 and $411 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Long-term Borrowings

In May 2020, the Company issued $500 of senior notes with an annual fixed interest rate of 1.80% and a maturity date of May 15, 2030 and used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under the Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in May and November. The notes carry an effective interest rate of 1.96% (See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The notes rank equally with all of the Company's existing senior indebtedness. 

Stock Repurchases and Dividend Payments

As of June 30, 2021, the Company had two stock repurchase programs: an open-market purchase program with an authorized aggregate purchase amount of up to $2,000, which has no expiration date and was authorized by the Board of Directors in May 2018, and a program to offset the anticipated impact of dilution related to stock-based awards (the Evergreen Program), which has no authorization limit on the dollar amount and no expiration date. 

10

Stock repurchases under the two stock repurchase programs were as follows during the fiscal years ended June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Dividends per share and total dividends paid to Clorox stockholders were as follows during the fiscal years ended June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

On June 2, 2021, the Company declared a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend, from $1.11 to $1.16 per share, payable on August 13, 2021 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 28, 2021.

On May 19, 2020, the Company declared a 5% increase in the quarterly dividend, from $1.06 to $1.11 per share, payable on August 14, 2020 to common stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 29, 2020.

Contractual Obligations

The Company had contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021, payable or maturing in the following fiscal years:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Purchase obligations are defined as purchase agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that contain specified or determinable significant terms, including quantity, price and the approximate timing of the transaction. For purchase obligations subject to variable price and/or quantity provisions, an estimate of the price and/or quantity has been made. Examples of the Company’s purchase obligations include contracts to purchase raw materials, commitments to contract manufacturers, commitments for information technology and related services, advertising contracts, capital expenditure agreements, software acquisition and license commitments and service contracts. The raw material contracts included above are entered into during the regular course of business based on expectations of future purchases. Many of these raw material contracts are flexible to allow for changes in the Company’s business and related requirements. If such changes were to occur, the Company believes its exposure could differ from the amounts listed above. Any amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as Accounts payable and accrued liabilities are excluded from the table above, as they are short-term in nature and expected to be paid within one year.

(2)These amounts represent expected payments through 2031. Based on the accounting rules for nonqualified retirement income and retirement health care plans, the liabilities reflected in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets differ from these expected future payments (see Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

(3)The Company has a venture agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for the Company’s Glad bags and wraps business (the Venture Agreement). As of June 30, 2021, P&G had a 20% interest in the venture. Upon termination of the agreement in January 2026, the Company is required to purchase P&G’s 20% interest for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures. Refer to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

11

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company may provide typical indemnifications (e.g., indemnifications for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) that have terms that vary in duration and in the potential amount of the total obligation and, in many circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The Company has not made, nor does it believe that it is probable that it will make, any material payments relating to its indemnifications, and believes that any reasonably possible payments would not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

CONTINGENCIES

A summary of contingencies is contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As a multinational company, the Company is exposed to the impact of changes in commodity prices, foreign currency fluctuations, interest-rate risk and other types of market risk.

In the normal course of business, where available at a reasonable cost, the Company manages its exposure to market risk using contractual agreements and a variety of derivative instruments. The Company’s objective in managing its exposure to market risk is to limit the impact of fluctuations on earnings and cash flow through the use of derivative instruments, including over-the-counter swaps, forward purchase contracts and exchange-traded futures contracts. Over-the-counter derivative contracts are entered into for non-trading purposes with major credit-worthy institutions, thereby decreasing the risk of credit loss.

The Company uses different methodologies, when necessary, to estimate the fair value of its derivative contracts. The estimated fair values of the majority of the Company’s contracts are based on quoted market prices, exchange-traded market prices or broker price quotations, and represent the estimated amounts that the Company would pay or receive to terminate the contracts.

See Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies and fair value measurements.

Sensitivity Analysis for Derivative Contracts

For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company’s exposure to market risk was estimated using sensitivity analyses, which illustrate the change in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument assuming hypothetical changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates. The results of the sensitivity analyses for commodity, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts are summarized below. Actual changes in commodity prices, foreign exchange rates or interest rates may differ from the hypothetical changes, and any changes in the fair value of the contracts, real or hypothetical, would be partly to fully offset by an inverse change in the value of the underlying hedged items.

The changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with an offset to Net earnings or Other comprehensive (loss) income, depending on whether or not, for accounting purposes, the derivative is designated and qualified as an accounting hedge. For those derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedging instruments, the Company must designate the hedging instrument either as a fair value hedge or as a cash flow hedge. The Company designates its commodity swaps and futures contracts for forecasted purchases of raw materials, foreign currency forward contracts for forecasted purchases of inventory, and interest rate contracts for forecasted interest payments as cash flow hedges. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no hedging instruments designated as fair value hedges. In the event the Company has contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, the Company recognizes the changes in the fair value of these contracts in the consolidated statement of earnings.

Commodity Price Risk

The Company is exposed to changes in the price of commodities used as raw materials in the manufacturing of its products. The Company uses various strategies, where available at a reasonable cost to manage cost exposures on certain raw material purchases with the objective of obtaining more predictable costs for these commodities, including long-term commodity purchase contracts and commodity derivative contracts. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the Company had derivative contracts related to raw material exposures for soybean oil used for the Food products business and jet fuel used for the Grilling business. 

12

Based on a hypothetical decrease or increase of 10% in these commodity prices as of June 30, 2021, and June 30, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Company’s then-existing commodity derivative contracts would decrease or increase by $4 and $2, respectively, with the corresponding impact included in Other comprehensive (loss) income.

Foreign Currency Risk

The Company seeks to minimize the impact of certain foreign currency fluctuations by hedging transactional exposures related to inventory purchases with foreign currency forward contracts. Based on a hypothetical decrease of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Company’s then-existing foreign currency derivative contracts would decrease by $8 and $8, respectively, with the corresponding impact included in Other comprehensive (loss) income. Based on a hypothetical increase of 10% in the value of the U.S. dollar as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Company’s then-existing foreign currency derivative contracts would increase by $6 and $6, respectively.

Interest Rate Risk

The Company can be exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to short-term borrowings, using commercial paper or under the Credit Agreement, in addition to potential changes in interest rates relating to anticipated future issuances of long-term debt. The Company had no material exposure to interest rate volatility through any short-term borrowing arrangements during fiscal year 2021. Weighted average interest rates for short-term borrowings using commercial paper and under the Credit Agreement borrowings were 2.12% during fiscal year 2020. Assuming average commercial paper and Credit Agreement borrowing levels during fiscal years 2021 and 2020, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense from short-term borrowings by approximately $0 and $4, respectively. 

The Company is also exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to anticipated future issuances of debt. Primary exposures include movements in U.S. Treasury and swap rates. Based on a hypothetical increase or decrease of 100 basis points to 10-year swap rates as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the estimated fair value of the Company’s existing forward starting interest rate swap contracts would increase or decrease by $27 and $21 during fiscal year 2021 and 2020, respectively, with the corresponding impact recorded in Other comprehensive (loss) income.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

A summary of all recently issued accounting standards is contained in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The methods, estimates, and judgments the Company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the Company reports in its consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, a different financial presentation could result depending on the judgments, estimates or assumptions that are used. The most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require the Company to make the most difficult and subjective judgments, often estimating the outcome of future events that are inherently uncertain. The Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates are related to: 

•Revenue recognition; 

•The valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets; 

•Income taxes;

•The Venture Agreement terminal obligation; and 

•Business combinations.

The Company’s critical accounting policies and estimates have been reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies and estimates is contained in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

13

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished products to customers. This revenue is reported net of certain variable consideration provided to customers, generally in the form of one-time and ongoing trade-promotion programs. These trade-promotion programs include shelf price reductions, in-store merchandising, consumer coupons, and other trade-related activities. Amounts accrued for trade-promotions are based on various factors such as contractual terms and sales volumes, and also incorporate estimates that include customer participation rates, the rate at which customers will achieve program performance criteria, product availability, and consumer redemption rates. The actual amounts remitted to customers for these activities may differ from the Company’s estimates, depending on how actual results of the programs compare to the estimates. If the Company’s trade promotion accrual estimates as of June 30, 2021 were to increase or decrease by 10%, the impact on net sales would be approximately $21.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company tests its goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fiscal fourth quarter unless there are indications during a different interim period that these assets may have become impaired.

Goodwill

For fiscal year 2021, the Company’s reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes were its individual SBUs. These reporting units, which are also the Company’s operating segments, are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by the manager of the respective operating segments. The respective operating segment managers, who have responsibility for operating decisions, allocating resources and assessing performance within their respective segments, do not review financial information for components that are below the operating segment level. 

In its evaluation of goodwill impairment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors such as the maturity and stability of the reporting unit, the magnitude of the excess fair value over the carrying value from a prior period’s impairment testing, other reporting unit operating results, micro and macroeconomic factors as well as new events and circumstances impacting the operations at the reporting unit level. If the test indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative test is performed. In the quantitative test the Company compares the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit.

To determine the fair value of a reporting unit as part of its quantitative test, the Company uses a discounted cash flow (DCF) method under the income approach, as it believes that this approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair value of its businesses and the fair value of their future earnings and cash flows. Under this approach, the Company estimates the future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects their relative risk. The cash flows used in the DCF method are consistent with those the Company uses in its internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced, and the long-term business strategy. The other key estimates and factors used in the DCF method include, but are not limited to, net sales and expense growth rates, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, inflation and a terminal growth rate. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in the impairment testing for goodwill could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, as a result of lower than expected actual and projected net sales growth and operating performance for the VMS SBU, a strategic review was initiated by management that resulted in updated financial and operational plans. These events were considered a triggering event requiring interim impairment assessments to be performed on the VMS reporting unit, indefinite-lived trademarks and other assets. Based on the outcome of these assessments, a $228 goodwill impairment charge was recorded during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. The VMS SBU had goodwill following the impairment charge of $306 as of June 30, 2021. As the VMS reporting unit's carrying value was written down to its estimated fair value, this reporting unit had 20% or less excess fair value over carrying amount as of its latest fiscal year 2021 impairment testing date and is considered to have a heightened risk of future impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors unfavorably change in the future. The Company is closely monitoring any events, circumstances or changes in this business that might imply a further reduction in the estimated fair value and lead to an additional goodwill impairment. No other impairments for goodwill were identified during fiscal year 2021.

Trademarks and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

For trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors, such as the maturity and stability of the trademark or other intangible asset, the magnitude of the excess fair value over carrying value from a prior period’s impairment testing, other specific operating results, as well as new events and circumstances impacting the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. If the result of a qualitative test indicates that it is more likely that not that the asset is impaired a quantitative test is performed. When a quantitative test is performed, the 

14

estimated fair value of an asset is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of such asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. The Company uses a DCF method under the relief from royalty income approach to estimate the fair value of its trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. This approach requires significant judgments in determining the royalty rates and the assets’ estimated cash flows, including consideration of related net sales growth rates, as well as the appropriate discount and foreign exchange rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. Future changes in such estimates or the use of alternative assumptions could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, as as result of the interim impairment assessments performed on various VMS assets, an $86 impairment charge to indefinite-lived trademarks was recorded. No other impairments for trademarks or other intangible assets with indefinite lives were identified in fiscal year 2021.

Finite-Lived Intangible Assets

Finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. The Company’s impairment review requires significant judgment by management, including estimating the future success of product lines, future sales volumes, revenue and expense growth rates, alternative uses for the assets and proceeds from the disposal of the assets. The Company reviews business plans for possible impairment indicators. The risk of impairment is initially assessed based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. The asset (or asset group) is not recoverable when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset. When impairment is indicated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the asset’s (or asset group’s) carrying value and its estimated fair value. Depending on the asset, estimated fair value may be determined either by use of a DCF method or, if available, by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition. Future changes in such estimates or the use of alternative assumptions could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values.

During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, as as result of the interim impairment assessments performed on various VMS assets, a $14 impairment charge to finite-lived intangible assets was recorded. 

Additionally during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, an impairment charge of $14 was recorded related to other intangible assets with finite lives that were no longer expected to be recoverable due to a pending exit from from a Professional Products SBU supplier relationship. No other impairments for finite-lived intangible assets were identified in fiscal year 2021.

Income Taxes

The Company’s effective tax rate is based on income by tax jurisdiction, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the Company in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s effective tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions.

The Company maintains valuation allowances when it is likely that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company’s income tax provision in the period of change. In determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted, the Company takes into account such factors as prior earnings history, expected future earnings, unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect the utilization of a deferred tax asset, statutory carry-back and carry-forward periods and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset. Valuation allowances maintained by the Company relate mostly to deferred tax assets arising from the Company’s currently anticipated inability to use net operating losses and tax credits in certain foreign countries. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, valuation allowances related to the realization of deferred tax assets were approximately $42 and $38, respectively.

In addition to valuation allowances, the Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet certain recognition thresholds or measurement standards. Amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in quarters when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, the liabilities recorded for uncertain tax positions, excluding associated interest and penalties, were approximately $21 and $22, respectively. Since audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty, liabilities for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the contractual obligations table (See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Foreign withholding taxes are not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested. The Company has no indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings and is therefore providing foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of all foreign subsidiaries where applicable.

15

Venture Agreement Terminal Obligation 

The Company has a Venture Agreement with Procter & Gamble (P&G) for the Company’s Glad bags and wraps business. In connection with this agreement, P&G provides R&D support to the Glad business. As of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020, P&G had a 20% interest in the venture. In December 2017, the Company and P&G extended the term of the agreement and the related R&D support provided by P&G. The term will expire in January 2026, unless the parties agree, on or prior to January 31, 2025, to further extend the term of the agreement for another seven years or agree to take some other relevant action. Upon termination of the agreement, the Company is required to purchase P&G’s 20% interest for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures. The Company’s obligation to purchase P&G’s interest is reflected in Other liabilities (See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized, and any future changes in the fair value of P&G’s interest, is charged to Cost of products sold in accordance with the effective interest method over the remaining life of the agreement.

The estimated fair value of P&G’s interest may increase or decrease up until any such purchase by the Company of P&G’s interest. The Company uses the DCF method under the income approach to estimate the fair value of P&G’s interest. Under this approach, the Company estimates the future cash flows and discounts these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects its risk. The cash flows used are consistent with those the Company uses in its internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced and the long-term business strategy. The other key assumptions and estimates used include, but are not limited to, net sales and expense growth rates, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, discount rates, inflation and terminal growth rates. Changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates used could result in significantly different estimates of fair value. For perspective, if the discount rate as of June 30, 2021 were to increase or decrease by 100 basis points, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest would decrease by approximately $71 or increase by approximately $94, respectively. Such changes would affect the amount of future charges to Cost of products sold. 

Business Combinations

The Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. The determination of fair value requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including but not limited to: estimated future cash flows, net sales and expense growth rates, terminal growth rates, discount and premium rates, royalty rates, and income tax rates. The excess of the total of the purchase consideration, fair value of the noncontrolling interest, and fair value of the previously held equity interest over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the assets recorded in the consolidated financial statements, such as intangible assets and goodwill, may be exposed to potential impairments in future periods. 

During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company increased its investment in each of the two entities comprising its joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi joint venture). The Company had previously accounted for its 30 percent investment under the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the closing of this transaction, the Company’s total ownership interest in each of the entities increased to 51 percent, and the Company obtained control. The acquisition of the additional equity interest was considered a step acquisition, whereby the Company remeasured the previously held equity method investment to its fair value, resulting in the recognition of a significant non-recurring, non-cash gain. 

The fair values of the Saudi joint venture, the 49% noncontrolling interest, and previously held 30% equity interest were determined using the DCF method under the income approach. Under this approach, the Company estimated future cash flows and discounted these cash flows at a rate of return that reflected the entities’ relative risk. Additionally, valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies were used to corroborate that the estimated fair value for the Saudi joint venture as a whole under the DCF approach was reasonable. The fair value of reacquired rights was estimated using the multi-period excess earnings method under the income approach, which was based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows, or excess earnings, attributable only to the reacquired rights over the remaining contractual life. See Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

SUMMARY OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES

The non-GAAP financial measures that may be included in this MD&A and Exhibit 99.2 and the reasons management believes they are useful to investors are described below. These measures should be considered supplemental in nature and are not intended to be a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, these measures may not be the same as similarly named measures presented by other companies.

Free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operations less capital expenditures. The Company’s management uses this measure and free cash flow as a percentage of net sales to help assess the cash generation ability of the business and funds available for investing activities, such as acquisitions, investing in the business to drive growth, and financing activities, 

16

including debt payments, dividend payments and stock repurchases. Free cash flow does not represent cash available only for discretionary expenditures, since the Company has mandatory debt service requirements and other contractual and non-discretionary expenditures. Refer to “Free cash flow” and “Free cash flow as a percentage of net sales” above for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures.

The Company uses the term Consolidated EBITDA because it is a term used in its revolving Credit Agreement. As defined in the Credit Agreement, Consolidated EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash asset impairment charges and other non-cash, non-recurring gains or losses. Interest Coverage ratio is the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to interest expense. The Company’s management believes disclosure of Consolidated EBITDA provides useful information to investors because it is used in the primary restrictive covenant in the Company’s Credit Agreement. For additional discussion of the Interest Coverage ratio and a reconciliation of Consolidated EBITDA, see “Financial Position and Liquidity - Financing Activities - Credit Arrangements” above.

EBIT represents earnings before income taxes, interest income and interest expense. EBIT margin is the ratio of EBIT to net sales. The Company’s management believes these measures provide useful additional information to investors to enhance their understanding about trends in the Company’s operations and are useful for period-over-period comparisons.

Economic profit (EP) is defined by the Company as earnings before income taxes, excluding non-cash U.S. GAAP items (such as restructuring and intangible asset impairment charges, non-cash gains or losses), and interest expense; less income taxes (calculated based on the Company’s effective tax rate excluding the identified U.S. GAAP items), and less after tax profit attributable to noncontrolling interests, and less a capital charge (calculated as average capital employed multiplied by a cost of capital rate). EP is a key financial metric that the Company’s management uses to evaluate business performance and allocate resources, and is a component in determining employee incentive compensation. The Company’s management believes EP provides additional perspective to investors about financial returns generated by the business and represents profit generated over and above the cost of capital used by the business to generate that profit. Refer to Exhibit 99.2 for a reconciliation of EP to earnings before income taxes.

Organic sales growth / (decrease) is defined as net sales growth excluding the effect of foreign exchange rate changes and any acquisitions and divestitures. Management believes that the presentation of organic sales growth / (decrease) is useful to investors because it excludes sales from any acquisitions and divestitures, which results in a comparison of sales only from the businesses that the Company was operating and expects to continue to operate throughout the relevant periods, and the Company’s estimate of the impact of foreign exchange rate changes, which are difficult to predict, and out of the control of the Company and management. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of organic sales growth / (decrease) (non-GAAP) to net sales growth / (decrease) (GAAP), the most comparable GAAP measure:

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework published in 2013. Management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, and concluded that it is effective.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Clorox Company

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Clorox Company (the Company) as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated August 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases, effective July 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Valuation of Goodwill and Trademarks with Indefinite Lives

Description of the Matter

At June 30, 2021, the Company’s goodwill was $1.6 billion and represented 25% of total assets; trademarks with indefinite lives was $670 million and represented 11% of total assets. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are tested by the Company’s management for impairment at least annually, in the fiscal fourth quarter, unless there are indications of impairment at other points throughout the year. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. During the fiscal third quarter of 2021, management performed a strategic review of the Vitamins, Minerals and Supplements (VMS) strategic business unit in response to lower-than-expected growth and performance, resulting in updated financial and operational plans. Accordingly, the Company performed an interim impairment assessment on the VMS reporting unit, indefinite-lived trademarks and other assets. As described in Note 5, the Company recorded impairment charges on goodwill and indefinite-lived trademarks of $228 million and $86 million, respectively.

Auditing the Company’s annual and interim impairment tests for goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives is complex and highly judgmental and required the involvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant judgment in estimating the fair value of reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives. In particular, the fair value estimates of reporting units with fair values that do not significantly exceed or that fall below their carrying values are sensitive to assumptions such as net sales growth rates, gross margins and discount rates. Trademarks with indefinite lives with fair values that do not significantly exceed or that fall below their carrying values are sensitive to assumptions such as net sales growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. All of these assumptions are sensitive to and affected by expected future market or economic conditions, particularly those in emerging markets, and industry and company-specific qualitative factors. 

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill and trademarks impairment review process. This included evaluating controls over the Company’s budgetary and forecasting process used to develop the estimated future earnings and cash flows used in estimating the fair value of reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives. We also tested controls over management’s review of the data used in their valuation models and review of the significant assumptions such as estimation of net sales, expense growth rates and terminal growth rates.

To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives (with fair values that do not significantly exceed or that fall below carrying values), we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop the estimates of future earnings and cash flows and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, the Company’s historical results and other guideline companies within the same industry, and we evaluated whether changes in the Company’s business would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives resulting from changes in these assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in reviewing the valuation methodology and testing the terminal growth rates, discount rates and royalty rates. 

In addition, for goodwill we also tested the Company’s calculation of implied multiples of the reporting units, compared them to guideline companies and evaluated the resulting premium. For trademarks with indefinite lives, where applicable, we also assessed whether the assumptions used were consistent with those used in the goodwill impairment review process.

Valuation of Venture Agreement Terminal Obligation

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 8 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has an agreement with The Proctor & Gamble Company (P&G) for the Company’s Glad bags and wraps business, for which the Company is required to purchase P&G’s 20% interest in the venture for cash at fair value of the global Glad business upon termination of the agreement. At June 30, 2021, the fair value of $432 million has been recognized as a venture agreement terminal obligation and represented 8% of total liabilities. 

Auditing the Company’s Glad venture agreement terminal obligation is complex and highly judgmental and required the involvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the global Glad business. In particular, the fair value estimate is sensitive to assumptions such as net sales growth rates, gross margins, discount rate and commodity prices. These assumptions are sensitive to and affected by expected future market or economic conditions, particularly those in emerging markets, and industry and company-specific qualitative factors.

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the venture agreement terminal obligation valuation review process. This included controls over the Company’s budgetary and forecasting process used to develop the estimated fair value of the global Glad business. We also tested management’s controls over the data used in their valuation models and review of the significant assumptions such as estimation of net sales, expense growth rates, terminal growth rates and commodity prices.

To test the estimated fair value of the venture agreement terminal obligation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop estimates of future earnings and cash flows, and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, the Company’s historical results 

and other guideline companies within the same industry, and we evaluated whether changes in the Company’s business, including shifts in consumer demands and commodity prices, would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the venture agreement terminal obligation resulting from changes in these assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in reviewing the valuation methodology and testing the terminal growth rates and discount rates.  

Business Combination of Saudi Joint Venture

Description of the Matter

On July 9, 2020, the Company increased its investment in each of the two entities comprising its joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi joint venture) for a total purchase consideration of $111 million. The Company had previously accounted for its 30 percent investment under the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the closing of this transaction, the Company’s total ownership interest in each of the entities increased to 51 percent. As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company has consolidated this joint venture into the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and accounted for the transaction as a business combination whereby the total purchase price was allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The acquisition resulted in remeasurement of the Company’s previously held equity interest to its acquisition-date fair value of $103 million, resulting in a gain of $85 million, recognition of noncontrolling interests of $198 million, and a $138 million reacquired rights intangible asset being recorded. 

Auditing the Company’s accounting for its acquisition of the Saudi joint venture is complex and highly judgmental and required the involvement of a valuation specialist due to the significant judgment in estimating the fair value of the Company’s previously held equity interest, the noncontrolling interests and identified intangible assets, consisting principally of reacquired license rights. In particular, the fair value estimates are sensitive to assumptions such as revenue growth rates and discount and premium rate assumptions. These assumptions relate to the future performance of the acquired business, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions and industry and company-specific qualitative factors. 

23

How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit

We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the fair value review process. This included evaluating controls over the Company’s budgetary and forecasting process used to develop the estimated future earnings and cash flows used in estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest, the noncontrolling interests and identifiable intangible assets. We also tested controls over management’s review of the data used in their valuation models and review of the significant assumptions such as estimation of net sales, expense growth rates, and terminal growth rates.

To test the estimated fair value of the previously held interest, the noncontrolling interests and identified intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies, testing the significant assumptions discussed above used to develop the estimates of future earnings and cash flows and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, the Company’s historical results and other guideline companies within the same industry, and evaluated whether changes in the Company’s business would affect the significant assumptions. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the fair value of the previously held interest, the noncontrolling interests and identified intangible assets resulting from changes in these assumptions. We involved our valuation specialist to assist in reviewing the valuation methodologies and testing the discount and premium rate assumptions.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of The Clorox Company

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited The Clorox Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, The Clorox Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of The Clorox Company as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”) and our report dated August 10, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. 

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

(Dollars in millions, except per share data)

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation

The Company is principally engaged in the production, marketing and sale of consumer products through mass retailers, grocery outlets, warehouse clubs, dollar stores, home hardware centers, drug, pet and military stores, third-party and owned e-commerce channels, and distributors. The consolidated financial statements include the statements of the Company and its wholly owned and controlled subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts were eliminated in consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) requires management to reach opinions as to estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Specific areas requiring the application of management’s estimates and judgments include, among others, assumptions pertaining to accruals for consumer and trade-promotion programs, stock-based compensation, retirement income plans, future cash flows associated with impairment testing of goodwill and other long-lived assets and the valuation of the venture agreement terminal obligation, the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with a business combination, the credit worthiness of customers, uncertain tax positions, tax valuation allowances and legal, environmental and insurance matters. Actual results could materially differ from estimates and assumptions made.

Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash

Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid interest-bearing accounts, time deposits held by financial institutions and money market funds with an initial maturity at purchase of 90 days or less. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying amount.

The Company’s cash position includes amounts held by foreign subsidiaries and, as a result, the repatriation of certain cash balances from some of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries could result in additional withholding tax costs in certain foreign jurisdictions. However, these cash balances are generally available without legal restriction to fund local business operations. In addition, a portion of the Company’s cash balance is held in U.S. dollars by foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is their local currency. Such U.S. dollar balances are reported on the foreign subsidiaries’ books in their functional currency, and the impact on such balances from foreign currency exchange rate differences is recorded in Other (income) expense, net. 

As of June 30, 2021, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company had $5, $8, $2 and $3 of restricted cash, respectively, which was included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets. The restricted cash as of June 30, 2021 was primarily related to funds held in an escrow account with limitations on usage and cash margin deposits held for exchange-traded futures contracts. 

Inventories

The Company values its inventories using both the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) and the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) methods. The FIFO inventory is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, which includes any costs to sell or dispose. In addition, appropriate consideration is given to obsolescence, excessive inventory levels, product deterioration and other factors in evaluating net realizable value. The LIFO inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market.

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets

Property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense are primarily calculated by the straight-line method using the estimated useful lives or lives determined by reference to the related lease contract in the case of leasehold improvements. The table below provides estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment by asset classification.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range from 1 to 30 years. 

Property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be fully recoverable. The risk of impairment is initially assessed based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by the asset (or asset group). When impairment is indicated, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) and its estimated fair market value. Depending on the asset, estimated fair market value may be determined either by use of a discounted cash flow model or by reference to estimated selling values of assets in similar condition.

Capitalization of Software Costs

The Company capitalizes certain qualifying costs incurred in the acquisition and development of software for internal use, including the costs of the software, materials, consultants, interest and payroll and payroll-related costs for employees during the application development stage. Internal and external costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post implementation-operation stage, mainly training and maintenance costs, are expensed as incurred. Once the application is substantially complete and ready for its intended use, qualifying costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful life. Capitalized internal use software is included in Property, plant and equipment. Capitalized software as a service is included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other assets and is amortized using the straight-line method over the term of the hosting arrangement which is typically no greater than 6 years.

Business Combinations

The Company records acquired businesses within the consolidated financial statements using the acquisition method prospectively from the acquisition date. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained, assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at their respective fair values on the acquisition date. The Company’s estimates of fair value are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. The excess of the total of the purchase consideration, fair value of the noncontrolling interest, and fair value of the previously held equity interest over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Measurement period adjustments to the fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill, if applicable, are applied in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined based on new information obtained during the measurement period. In the event of a step acquisition, the Company records a gain or loss in Other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of earnings as a result of remeasuring a previously held equity interest to fair value on the acquisition date. Transaction expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Impairment Review of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

The Company tests its goodwill, trademarks with indefinite lives and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment in the fiscal fourth quarter unless there are indications during a different interim period that these assets may have become impaired.

With respect to goodwill, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors, such as the maturity and stability of the reporting unit, the magnitude of the excess fair value over carrying value from a previous period’s impairment testing, other reporting unit specific operating results, micro and macroeconomic factors as well as new events and circumstances impacting the operations at the reporting unit level. Reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes were its individual strategic 

32

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

business units (SBUs). If the result of a qualitative test indicates a potential for impairment of a reporting unit, a quantitative test is performed. In the quantitative test, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the reporting unit. 

To determine the fair value of a reporting unit as part of its quantitative test, the Company uses the discounted cash flow (DCF) method under the income approach, as it believes that this approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair value of its businesses and the fair value of their future earnings and cash flows. Under this approach, which requires significant judgments, the Company estimates the future cash flows of each reporting unit and discounts these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects their relative risk. The cash flows used in the DCF method are consistent with those the Company uses in its internal planning, which gives consideration to actual business trends experienced, and the broader business strategy for the long term. The other key estimates and factors used in the DCF method include, but are not limited to, net sales and expense growth rates, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, inflation and a terminal growth rate. Changes in such estimates or the application of alternative assumptions could produce different results.

For trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors, such as the maturity and stability of the trademark or other intangible asset, the magnitude of the excess fair value over carrying value from a previous period’s impairment testing, other specific operating results, as well as new events and circumstances impacting the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of the intangible asset. If the result of a qualitative test indicates that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, a quantitative test is performed. When a quantitative test is performed, the estimated fair value of an asset is compared to its carrying value. If the carrying value of such asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value. The Company uses the DCF method under the relief from royalty income approach to estimate the fair value of its trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. This approach requires significant judgments in determining the royalty rates and the assets’ estimated cash flows, as well as the appropriate discount and foreign exchange rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. Changes in such estimates or the use of alternative assumptions could produce different results. 

Leases

The Company determines whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration and other facts and circumstances. Right-of-use (ROU) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are calculated based on the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments paid to the lessor at or before the commencement date and initial direct costs incurred by the Company and excludes any lease incentives received from the lessor. Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The lease term may include an option to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option as of the commencement date of the lease, and is reviewed in subsequent periods if a triggering event occurs. As the Company’s leases typically do not contain a readily determinable implicit rate, the Company determines the present value of the lease liability using its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date based on the lease term and the currency of the lease on a collateralized basis. Variable lease payments are the portion of lease payments that are not fixed over the lease term. Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred, and include certain non-lease components, such as maintenance and other services provided by the lessor, and other charges included in the lease, as applicable. The Company elected to combine lease and non-lease components as a single lease component and to exclude short-term leases, defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, from its consolidated balance sheet.

As of July 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Codification 842, Leases (ASC 842). As allowed under the standard, the Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients to not reassess prior conclusions related to contracts containing leases, lease classification and initial direct costs.

Stock-based Compensation

The Company grants various nonqualified stock-based compensation awards to eligible employees, including stock options, restricted stock awards and performance shares.

For stock options, the Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping. The total number of stock options expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. Changes to the actual and estimated 

33

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. Compensation expense is recorded by amortizing the grant date fair values on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.

For restricted stock awards, the fair value of each grant issued is estimated on the date of grant based on the current market price of the stock. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical data. The total number of restricted stock awards expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. Changes to the actual and estimated forfeitures will result in a cumulative adjustment in the period of change. Compensation expense is recorded by amortizing the grant date fair values on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures.

The Company’s performance shares provide for the issuance of common stock to certain managerial staff and executive management if the Company achieves specified performance targets. The number of shares issued is dependent upon the achievement of specified performance targets. The performance period is three years and the payout determination is made at the end of the three-year performance period. Performance shares receive dividends earned during the vesting period upon vesting. The fair value of each grant issued is estimated on the date of grant based on the current market price of the stock. The total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects estimated forfeiture rates and management’s assessment of the probability that performance goals will be achieved. A cumulative adjustment is recognized to compensation expense in the current period to reflect any changes in the probability of achievement of performance goals.

Cash flows resulting from tax deductions in excess of the cumulative compensation cost recognized for stock-based payment arrangements (excess tax benefits) are classified as operating cash inflows.

Employee Benefits

The Company accounts for its retirement income and retirement health care plans using actuarial methods. These methods use an attribution approach that generally spreads “plan events” over the service lives or expected lifetime (for frozen plans) of plan participants. Examples of plan events are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as the expected return on plan assets, discount rate, rate of compensation increase and certain employee-related factors, such as retirement age and mortality. The principle underlying the attribution approach is that employees render service over their employment period on a relatively “smooth” basis and, therefore, the statement of earnings effects of retirement income and retirement health care plans are recognized in the same pattern. One of the principal assumptions used in the net periodic benefit cost calculation is the expected return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets may result in recognized expense or income that differs from the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the goal is for the expected long-term returns to approximate the actual returns and, therefore, the expectation is that the pattern of income and expense recognition should closely match the pattern of the services provided by the participants. The Company uses a market-related value method for calculating plan assets for purposes of determining the amortization of actuarial gains and losses. The differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the net periodic benefit cost calculation over the average remaining service period or expected lifetime (for frozen plans) of the plan participants using the corridor approach. Under this approach, only actuarial gains (losses) that exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of assets are amortized to the Company’s net periodic benefit cost. In developing its expected return on plan assets, the Company considers the long-term actual returns relative to the mix of investments that comprise its plan assets and also develops estimates of future investment returns by considering external sources.

The Company recognizes an actuarial-based obligation at the onset of disability for certain benefits provided to individuals after employment, but before retirement, that include medical, dental, vision, life and other benefits.

Environmental Costs

The Company is involved in certain environmental remediation and ongoing compliance activities. Accruals for environmental matters are recorded on a site-by-site basis when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and based upon a reasonable estimate of the liability. The Company’s accruals reflect the anticipated participation of other potentially responsible parties in those instances where it is probable that such parties are legally responsible and financially capable of paying their respective shares of the relevant costs. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. The accrual for environmental matters is included in Accounts payable and accrued liabilities and Other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets on an undiscounted basis due to uncertainty regarding the timing of future payments.

34

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Revenue is recognized at the point in time when performance obligations under the terms of customer contracts are satisfied, which is when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, and can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer, depending upon the particular customer arrangement. Shipping and handling activities are accounted for as contract fulfillment costs and included within Cost of products sold. After the completion of the performance obligation, there is an unconditional right to consideration as outlined in the contract. A right is considered unconditional if nothing other than the passage of time is required before payment of that consideration is due. The Company typically collects its customer receivables within two months. All performance obligations under the terms of contracts with customers have an original duration of one year or less.

The Company has trade promotion programs, which primarily include shelf price reductions, in-store merchandising, and consumer coupons. The costs of such activities, defined as variable consideration under ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” are netted against sales and recorded when the related sales take place. Accruals for trade promotion programs are established based on the Company’s best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future obligations for products sold as of the balance sheet date. Amounts accrued for trade-promotions are based on various factors such as contractual terms and sales volumes, and also incorporate estimates that include customer participation rates, the rate at which customers will achieve program performance criteria, product availability, and consumer redemption rates.

The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience and ongoing assessment of its customers’ credit risk and aging. Customer receivables are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $8 and $10 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Receivables, net, include non-customer receivables of $22 and $20 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and related allowance of $14 and $4 as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 

Cost of Products Sold 

Cost of products sold represents the costs directly related to the manufacture and distribution of the Company’s products and primarily includes raw materials, packaging, contract manufacturing fees, shipping and handling, warehousing, package design, depreciation, amortization, direct and indirect labor and operating costs for the Company’s manufacturing and distribution facilities, including salary, benefit costs and incentive compensation, and royalties and other charges related to the Company’s Glad Venture Agreement (See Note 8).

Costs associated with developing and designing new packaging, including design, artwork, films and labeling, are expensed as incurred and included within Cost of products sold. 

Selling and Administrative Expenses

Selling and administrative expenses represent costs incurred by the Company in generating revenues and managing the business and include market research, commissions and certain administrative expenses. Administrative expenses include salary, benefits, incentive compensation, professional fees and services and other operating costs (such as software and licensing costs) associated with the Company’s non-manufacturing, non-research and development operations.

Advertising and Research and Development Costs

The Company expenses advertising and research and development costs in the period incurred.

Income Taxes

The Company uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement amounts and their respective tax basis. Management reviews the Company’s deferred tax assets to determine whether their value can be realized based upon available evidence. A valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in the Company’s income tax provision in the period of change. In addition to valuation allowances, the Company provides for uncertain tax positions when such tax positions do not meet certain recognition thresholds or measurement standards. Amounts for uncertain tax positions are adjusted in quarters when new information becomes available or when positions are effectively settled.

Per U.S. GAAP, foreign withholding taxes are provided on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested at the time the earnings are generated. The Company regularly reviews and assesses whether there are any changes to its indefinite reinvestment assertion and determined that none of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely 

35

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

reinvested. As a result, the Company is providing foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of all foreign subsidiaries where applicable. 

Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation

Local currencies are the functional currencies for substantially all of the Company’s foreign operations. When the transactional currency is different than the functional currency, transaction gains and losses are included as a component of Other (income) expense, net. In addition, certain assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a foreign subsidiary’s functional currency are reported on the subsidiary’s books in its functional currency, with the impact from exchange rate differences recorded in Other (income) expense, net. Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while income and expenses are translated at the respective average monthly exchange rates during the year.

Gains and losses on foreign currency translations are reported as a component of Other comprehensive (loss) income. The income tax effect of currency translation adjustments is recorded as a component of deferred taxes with an offset to Other comprehensive (loss) income where appropriate.

Effective July 1, 2018, under the requirements of U.S. GAAP, Argentina was designated as a highly inflationary economy, since it has experienced cumulative inflation of approximately 100 percent or more over a three-year period. As a result, beginning July 1, 2018, the U.S. dollar replaced the Argentine peso as the functional currency of the Company’s subsidiaries in Argentina (collectively, “Clorox Argentina”). Consequently, gains and losses from non-U.S. dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities for Clorox Argentina are recognized in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings.

Derivative Instruments

The Company’s use of derivative instruments, principally swaps, futures and forward contracts, is limited to non-trading purposes and is designed to partially manage exposure to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies. The Company’s contracts are hedges for transactions with notional amounts and periods consistent with the related exposures and do not constitute investments independent of these exposures.

The changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses) of a derivative instrument are recorded as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets with an offset to Net earnings or Other comprehensive (loss) income depending on whether, for accounting purposes, it has been designated and qualifies as an accounting hedge and, if so, on the type of hedging relationship. The criteria used to determine if hedge accounting treatment is appropriate are: (a) formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship, the risk management objective and hedging strategy at hedge inception; (b) eligibility of hedged items, transactions and corresponding hedging instrument; and (c) effectiveness of the hedging relationship both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis in achieving the hedging objectives. For those derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedging instruments, the Company must designate the hedging instrument either as a fair value hedge or as a cash flow hedge. The Company designates its commodity forward and future contracts for forecasted purchases of raw materials, interest rate contracts for forecasted interest payments, and foreign currency forward contracts for forecasted purchases of inventory as cash flow hedges. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had no hedging instruments designated as fair value hedges.

For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges, gains or losses is reported as a component of Other comprehensive (loss) income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. From time to time, the Company may have contracts not designated as hedges for accounting purposes, for which it recognizes changes in the fair value in the consolidated statement of earnings in the current period. Cash flows from hedging activities are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2019-12, “Income Taxes (ASC 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 and clarifies and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The standard will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. The amendments that are related to changes in ownership of foreign equity method investments or foreign subsidiaries are to be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments that are related to franchise taxes that are partially based on income are to be applied on either a retrospective basis for all periods presented or a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. All other amendments under this ASU are to be applied on a prospective basis. The adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment charge. The Company adopted this guidance as of July 1, 2020 on a prospective basis, and the adoption did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements at the time of adoption. The impairment identified in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 was calculated in accordance with this guidance. See Note 5 for further information. The future impact of this new standard will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of future impairments that may occur. 

NOTE 2. BUSINESS ACQUIRED

Saudi Joint Venture Acquisition

On July 9, 2020, the Company increased its investment in each of the two entities comprising its joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Saudi joint venture). The joint venture offers customers in the Gulf region a range of cleaning and disinfecting products. The Company had previously accounted for its 30 percent investment of $27 as of June 30, 2020, under the equity method of accounting. Subsequent to the closing of this transaction, the Company’s total ownership interest in each of the entities increased to 51 percent. The Company has consolidated this joint venture into the Company’s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition and reflects operations within the International reportable segment. The equity and income attributable to the other joint venture owners is recorded and presented as noncontrolling interests. 

The total purchase consideration of $111 consisted of $100 cash paid, which was sourced from operations, and $11 from the net effective settlement of preexisting arrangements between the Company and the joint venture. The assets and liabilities of the joint venture were recorded at their respective estimated fair value as of the acquisition date using generally accepted accounting principles for business combinations. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill in the International reportable segment in the amount of $208. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and reflects the value of further growth anticipated in the Gulf region. None of the goodwill is deductible for tax purposes.

As a result of this transaction, the carrying value of the Company’s previously held equity investment was remeasured to fair value, and resulted in an $85 non-recurring, non-cash gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of earnings and adjusted in Other operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The fair values of the noncontrolling interests and previously held equity interest were determined using the DCF method under the income approach. Under this approach, the Company estimates future cash flows and discounts these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the entities’ relative risk.

37

NOTE 2. BUSINESS ACQUIRED (Continued)

The purchase price allocation was finalized during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. The following table summarizes the final purchase price allocation for the fair value of the joint venture’s assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the related deferred income taxes as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed reflects the final insignificant measurement period adjustments related to goodwill, deferred income taxes and income taxes payable. The finite-lived intangibles acquired primarily represent the Company reacquiring previously licensed trademarks and customer relationships. The weighted-average estimated useful life of intangible assets subject to amortization was 9 years.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Included in the Company’s results for fiscal year 2021 was $84 of net sales from the joint venture. Pro forma results reflecting this transaction were not presented because it is not significant to the Company’s consolidated financial results.

NOTE 3. INVENTORIES

Inventories consisted of the following as of June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The LIFO method was used to value approximately 34% and 31% of inventories as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The carrying values for all other inventories are determined on the FIFO method. The effect on earnings of the liquidation of LIFO layers was insignificant for each of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. 

38

NOTE 4. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET

The components of property, plant and equipment, net, consisted of the following as of June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property, plant and equipment, net, was $179, $166 and $165 in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of which $6, $5 and $8 were related to amortization of capitalized software, respectively. 

Non-cash capital expenditures were $13, $7 and $2 for fiscal years, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no significant asset retirement obligations recorded and included in Buildings above for both fiscal years 2021 and 2020. 

NOTE 5. GOODWILL, TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The changes in the carrying amount of trademarks and other intangible assets for the fiscal years ended June 30 were as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) As of June 30, 2021 reflects changes of the useful lives of certain VMS indefinite-lived intangible assets to finite-lived effective April 1, 2021. 

39

Amortization expense relating to the Company’s intangible assets was $32, $14 and $15 for the years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Estimated amortization expense for these intangible assets is $31, $29, $28, $27 and $27 for fiscal years 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, respectively.

During fiscal year 2021, as a result of lower than expected actual and projected net sales growth and operating performance for the VMS SBU, a strategic review was initiated by management that resulted in updated financial and operational plans. These events were considered a triggering event requiring interim impairment assessments to be performed on the VMS reporting unit, indefinite-lived trademarks and other assets. Based on the outcome of these assessments, the following pre-tax impairment charges were recorded during fiscal year 2021 within Goodwill, trademark and other asset impairments:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The impairment charges are a result of a higher level of competitive activity than originally assumed, accelerated declines in the channel where the business is over-developed, and higher than anticipated investments to grow the business, which have adversely affected the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the respective assets held by the VMS reporting unit for growth and the estimates of expenses necessary to achieve that growth. These impairment charges are based on the Company’s current estimates regarding the future financial performance of the VMS SBU and macroeconomic factors. In connection with recognizing these impairment charges, the Company recognized tax benefits related to the impairments of $62 due to the partial tax deductibility of these charges.

To determine the fair value of the VMS reporting unit, the Company used the DCF method under the income approach. Under this approach, the Company estimated the future cash flows of the VMS reporting unit and discounted these cash flows at a rate of return that reflects its relative risk. The other key estimates and factors used in the DCF method include, but are not limited to, net sales and expense growth rates, and a terminal growth rate.

To determine the estimated fair values of the VMS related indefinite-lived trademarks, which were included within the Health and Wellness reportable segment, the Company used the income approach. This approach requires significant judgments in determining the royalty rates and the assets’ estimated cash flows as well as the appropriate discount rates applied to those cash flows to determine fair value. In addition, the useful lives of the impaired trademarks, with a remaining net carrying value of $13 as of March 31, 2021, were changed from indefinite to finite beginning on April 1, 2021, which reflects the remaining expected useful lives of the trademarks based on the most recent financial and operational plans. The weighted-average estimated useful life of these trademarks is 16 years.

Additionally during fiscal year 2021, an impairment charge of $14 was recorded within Cost of products sold related to other intangible assets with finite lives that were no longer expected to be recoverable due to a pending exit from a Professional Products SBU supplier relationship. The remaining carrying value of these assets was $0 following the impairment charge. 

No significant impairments were identified as a result of the Company’s impairment reviews during fiscal year 2020.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In May 2020, the Company issued $500 of senior notes with an annual fixed interest rate of 1.80% and a maturity date of May 15, 2030 and used the proceeds to repay borrowings under the revolving Credit Agreement and for general corporate purposes. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually in May and November. The notes carry an effective interest rate of 1.96%, which includes the impact of amortizing debt issuance costs and the gain on the related interest rate forward contracts over the life of the notes (See Note 9). The notes rank equally with all of the Company's existing senior indebtedness. 

The weighted average interest rates incurred on average outstanding long-term debt during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were 3.49%, 3.75% and 3.81%, respectively. The weighted average effective interest rates on long-term debt balances as of both June 30, 2021 and 2020 were 3.49% and 3.48%, respectively.

NOTE 7. DEBT (Continued)

Credit arrangements

In November 2019, the Company entered into a $1,200 revolving credit agreement (the Credit Agreement) that matures in November 2024. The Credit Agreement replaced a prior $1,100 revolving credit agreement in place since February 2017. The Company did not incur any fees or penalties in connection with terminating the prior agreement, which was considered a debt modification. The Company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants and limitations in the Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2021, and anticipates being in compliance with all restrictive covenants for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to monitor the financial markets and assess its ability to fully draw on its Credit Agreement, and currently expects that it will continue to have access to borrowing under the Credit Agreement. As of the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, there were no borrowings due under the Credit Agreement.

The Company’s borrowing capacity under the revolving credit agreements and other financing arrangements as of June 30 was as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Of the $35 of foreign and other credit lines as of June 30, 2021, $5 was outstanding and the remainder of $30 was available for borrowing. Of the $38 of foreign and other credit lines as of June 30, 2020, $3 was outstanding and the remainder of $35 was available for borrowing.

NOTE 8. OTHER LIABILITIES

Other liabilities consisted of the following as of June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Venture Agreement

The Company has an agreement with The Procter & Gamble Company (P&G) for the Company’s Glad bags and wraps business. In connection with this agreement, P&G provides research and development (R&D) support to the Glad business. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, P&G had a 20% interest in the venture. The Company pays a royalty to P&G for its interest in the profits, losses and cash flows, as contractually defined, of the Glad business, which is included in Cost of products sold. In December 2017, the Company and P&G extended the term of the agreement and the related R&D support provided by P&G. The term will expire in January 2026, unless the parties agree, on or prior to January 31, 2025, to further extend the term of the agreement for another seven years or agree to take some other relevant action. The agreement can be terminated under certain circumstances, including at P&G’s option upon a change in control of the Company or, at either party’s option, upon the sale of the Glad business by the Company. 

Upon termination of the agreement, the Company is required to purchase P&G’s 20% interest for cash at fair value as established by predetermined valuation procedures. As of June 30, 2021, the estimated fair value of P&G’s interest was $613, of which $432 has been recognized and is reflected in Other liabilities as noted in the table above. The difference between the estimated fair value and the amount recognized, and any future changes in the fair value of P&G’s interest, is charged to Cost of products sold in accordance with the effective interest method over the remaining life of the agreement. Following termination, the Glad business will retain the exclusive core intellectual property licenses contributed by P&G on a royalty-free basis for the licensed products marketed.

NOTE 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

Financial Risk Management and Derivative Instruments

The Company is exposed to certain commodity, foreign currency and interest rate risks related to its ongoing business operations and uses derivative instruments to mitigate its exposure to these risks.

Commodity Price Risk Management

The Company may use commodity exchange-traded futures and over-the-counter swap contracts, which are generally no longer than 2 years, to fix the price of a portion of its forecasted raw material requirements. Commodity purchase contracts are measured at fair value using market quotations obtained from the Chicago Board of Trade commodity futures exchange and commodity derivative dealers.

As of June 30, 2021, the notional amount of commodity derivatives was $32, of which $23 related to soybean oil futures used for the Food products business and $9 related to jet fuel swaps used for the Grilling business. As of June 30, 2020, the notional amount of commodity derivatives was $27, of which $14 related to soybean oil futures and $13 related to jet fuel swaps.

Foreign Currency Risk Management

The Company may also enter into certain over-the-counter derivative contracts to manage a portion of the Company’s forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with the purchase of inventory. These foreign currency contracts generally have durations of no longer than 2 years. The foreign exchange contracts are measured at fair value using information quoted by foreign exchange dealers.

The notional amounts of outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used by the Company’s subsidiaries to hedge forecasted purchases of inventory were $70 and $70, respectively, as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.

Interest Rate Risk Management

The Company may enter into over-the-counter interest rate contracts to fix a portion of the benchmark interest rate prior to the anticipated issuance of fixed rate debt. These interest rate contracts generally have durations of less than 3 years. The interest rate contracts are measured at fair value using information quoted by bond dealers.

The notional amounts of outstanding interest rate contracts used by the Company were $300 and $225, respectively, as of June 30, 2021 and June 30, 2020. These contracts represent forward starting interest rate swap contracts with a maturity date of September 2022 to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility associated with future interest payments on a forecasted debt issuance.

During fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into, and subsequently terminated, interest rate contracts related to the May 2020 issuance of $500 in senior notes (See Note 7). These contracts resulted in an insignificant gain recorded in Other comprehensive (loss) income, which is being amortized into Interest expense on the consolidated statement of earnings over the 10-year term of the notes.

Commodity, Foreign Exchange and Interest Rate Derivatives

The Company designates its commodity forward and futures contracts for forecasted purchases of raw materials, foreign

currency forward contracts for forecasted purchases of inventory, and interest rate contracts for forecasted interest

payments as cash flow hedges.

The effects of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments on Other comprehensive (loss) income and Net earnings were as follows during the fiscal years ended June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

NOTE 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The estimated amount of the existing net gain (loss) in Accumulated other comprehensive net (loss) income as of June 30, 2021 that is expected to be reclassified into Net earnings within the next twelve months is $10. 

Counterparty Risk Management and Derivative Contract Requirements

The Company utilizes a variety of financial institutions as counterparties for over-the-counter derivative instruments. The Company enters into agreements governing the use of over-the-counter derivative instruments and sets internal limits on the aggregate over-the-counter derivative instrument positions held with each counterparty. Certain terms of these agreements require the Company or the counterparty to post collateral when the fair value of the derivative instruments exceeds contractually defined counterparty liability position limits. Of the over-the-counter derivative instruments in liability positions held as of June 30, 2021 and 2020, $0 and $3, respectively, contained such terms. As of both June 30, 2021 and 2020, neither the Company nor any counterparty was required to post any collateral as no counterparty liability position limits were exceeded.

Certain terms of the agreements governing the Company’s over-the-counter derivative instruments require the credit ratings, as assigned by Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s to the Company and its counterparties, to remain at a level equal to or better than the minimum of an investment grade credit rating. If the Company’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, the counterparties to the derivative instruments could request full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions. As of both June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company and each of its counterparties had been assigned investment grade ratings by both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s.

Certain of the Company’s exchange-traded futures contracts used for commodity price risk management include requirements for the Company to post collateral in the form of a cash margin account held by the Company’s broker for trades conducted on that exchange. As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company maintained cash margin balances related to exchange-traded futures contracts of $0 and $2, respectively, which are classified as Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Trust Assets

The Company holds interests in mutual funds and cash equivalents as part of trust assets related to its nonqualified deferred compensation plans. The participants in the nonqualified deferred compensation plans, who are the Company’s current and former employees, may select among certain mutual funds in which their compensation deferrals are invested in accordance with the terms of the plan and within the confines of the trusts, which hold the marketable securities. The trusts represent variable interest entities for which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary, and, therefore, trust assets are consolidated and included in Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. The interests in mutual funds are measured at fair value using quoted market prices. The Company has designated these marketable securities as trading investments.

As of June 30, 2021, the value of the trust assets related to the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plans increased by $36 as compared to June 30, 2020.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets are required to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories of the fair value hierarchy:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

NOTE 9. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

As of June 30, 2021 and 2020, the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period included derivative financial instruments, which were classified as either Level 1 or Level 2, and trust assets to fund the Company’s nonqualified deferred compensation plans, which were classified as Level 1.

All of the Company's derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting. The following table provides information about the balance sheet classification and the fair values of the Company's derivative instruments:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The following table provides information about the balance sheet classification and the fair values of the Company's other assets and liabilities for which disclosure of fair value is required:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

____________________

(1)Cash and cash equivalents are composed of time deposits and other interest-bearing investments, including money market funds with original maturity dates of 90 days or less. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

(2)Notes and loans payable is composed of outstanding U.S. commercial paper balances and/or amounts drawn on the Company’s credit agreements, all of which are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.

(3)Current maturities of long-term debt and Long-term debt are recorded at cost. The fair value of Long-term debt, including current maturities, was determined using secondary market prices quoted by corporate bond dealers, and is classified as Level 2.

Furthermore, impairment charges of $343 were recorded during the fiscal year 2021, of which $228, $86, and $29 related to the goodwill of the VMS reporting unit, certain indefinite-lived trademarks and other assets, respectively. These adjustments were included as non-cash charges in the consolidated statement of earnings. The non-recurring fair values utilized included unobservable Level 3 inputs based on management’s best estimates and assumptions. See Note 5 for additional information.

NOTE 10. OTHER CONTINGENCIES, GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS

Contingencies

The Company is involved in certain environmental matters, including response actions at various locations. The Company had recorded liabilities totaling $28 as of both June 30, 2021 and 2020 for its share of aggregate future remediation costs related to these matters. 

One matter, which accounted for $14 of the recorded liability as of both June 30, 2021 and 2020, relates to environmental costs associated with one of the Company’s former operations at a site located in Alameda County, California. In November 2016, at the request of regulators and with the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company submitted a Feasibility Study that evaluated various options for managing the site and included estimates of the related costs. As a result, the Company recorded in Other (income) expense, net an undiscounted liability for costs estimated to be incurred over a 30-year period, based on the option recommended in the Feasibility Study. However, as a result of ongoing discussions with regulators, in June 2017, the Company increased its recorded liability to $14, which reflects anticipated costs to implement additional remediation measures at the site. While the Company believes its latest estimate is reasonable, regulators could require the Company to implement one of the other options evaluated in the Feasibility Study, with estimated undiscounted costs of up to $28 over an estimated 30-year period, or require the Company to take other actions and incur costs not included in the study. 

Another matter in Dickinson County, Michigan, at the site of one of the Company’s former operations for which the Company is jointly and severally liable, accounted for $10 of the recorded liability as of both June 30, 2021 and 2020. This amount reflects the Company’s agreement to be liable for 24.3% of the aggregate remediation and associated costs for this matter pursuant to a cost-sharing arrangement with a third party. If the third party is unable to pay its share of the response and remediation obligations, the Company may be responsible for such obligations. With the assistance of environmental consultants, the Company maintains an undiscounted liability representing its current best estimate of its share of the capital expenditures, maintenance and other costs that may be incurred over an estimated 30-year remediation period. Although it is reasonably possible that the Company’s exposure may exceed the amount recorded for the Dickinson County matter, any amount of such additional exposures, or range of exposures, is not estimable at this time. The Company’s estimated losses related to these matters are sensitive to a variety of uncertain factors, including the efficacy of any remediation efforts, changes in any remediation requirements, and the future availability of alternative clean-up technologies.

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies, including, without limitation, loss contingencies relating to contractual arrangements, product liability, patents and trademarks, advertising, labor and employment, environmental, health and safety and other matters. With respect to these proceedings, claims and other loss contingencies, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management at this time, the ultimate disposition of these matters, to the extent not previously provided for, will not have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

Guarantees

In conjunction with divestitures and other transactions, the Company may provide typical indemnifications (e.g., indemnifications for representations and warranties and retention of previously existing environmental, tax and employee liabilities) that have terms that vary in duration and in the potential amount of the total obligation and, in many circumstances, are not explicitly defined. The Company has not made, nor does it believe that it is probable that it will make, any material payments relating to its indemnifications, and believes that any reasonably possible payments would not have a material adverse effect, either individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s consolidated financial statements taken as a whole.

The Company had not recorded any material liabilities on the aforementioned guarantees as of June 30, 2021 and 2020.

The Company was a party to a letter of credit of $11 as of June 30, 2021 and $10 as of June 30, 2020, primarily related to one of its insurance carriers, of which $0 had been drawn upon.

NOTE 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS

In November 2012, the Company’s stockholders voted to approve the amended and restated 2005 Stock Incentive Plan (the Plan). The Plan permits the Company to grant various nonqualified stock-based compensation awards, including stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, deferred stock units, stock appreciation rights and other stock-based awards. The primary amendment reflected in the Plan was an increase of approximately 3 million common shares that may be issued for stock-based compensation purposes. As of June 30, 2021, the Company was authorized to grant up to approximately 7 million common shares, plus additional shares equal to shares that are potentially deliverable under an award that expires or are canceled, forfeited or settled without the delivery of shares, under the Plan. As of June 30, 2021, approximately 8 million common shares remained available for grant.

Compensation cost and the related income tax benefit recognized for stock-based compensation plans were classified as indicated below for the fiscal years ended June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Cash received during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 from stock options exercised under all stock-based payment arrangements was $133, $176 and $166, respectively. The Company issues shares for stock-based compensation plans from treasury stock. The Company may repurchase stock under its Evergreen Program to offset the estimated impact of dilution related to stock-based awards (See Note 12).

Details regarding the valuation and accounting for stock options, restricted stock awards, performance shares and deferred stock units for non-employee directors follow.

Stock Options

The fair value of each stock option award granted during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model and assumptions noted in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The expected life of the stock options is based on historical exercise patterns. The expected volatility is based on implied volatility from publicly traded options on the Company’s stock at the date of grant, historical implied volatility of the Company’s publicly traded options and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield on a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the option. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant.

52

NOTE 14. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (Continued)

Details of the Company’s stock option activities are summarized below:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The weighted-average fair value per share of each option granted during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, was $30.90, $20.03 and $22.38, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $109, $145 and $125, respectively.

Stock option awards outstanding as of June 30, 2021, have been granted at prices that are equal to the market value of the stock on the date of grant. Stock option grants generally vest over 4 years and expire no later than 10 years after the grant date. The Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. As of June 30, 2021, there was $12 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1 year, subject to forfeiture changes.

Restricted Stock Awards

The fair value of restricted stock awards is estimated on the date of grant based on the market price of the stock and is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the related vesting periods, which are generally 3 to 4 years. The total number of restricted stock awards expected to vest is adjusted by actual and estimated forfeitures. Restricted stock awards receive dividend distributions earned during the vesting period upon vesting.

As of June 30, 2021, there was $29 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1 year. The total fair value of the shares that vested in each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $15, $9 and $5, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of awards granted was $210.78, $156.25 and $152.12 per share for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

During fiscal year 2021, 105,000 shares vested. The total fair value of shares vested was $26, $26 and $37 during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Upon vesting, the recipients of the grants receive the distribution as shares or, if previously elected by eligible recipients, as deferred stock. Deferred shares continue to earn dividends, which are also deferred. 

Deferred Stock Units for Nonemployee Directors

Nonemployee directors receive annual grants of deferred stock units under the Company’s director compensation program and can elect to receive all or a portion of their annual retainers and fees in the form of deferred stock units. The deferred stock units receive dividend distributions, which are reinvested as deferred stock units, and are recognized at their fair value on the date of grant. Each deferred stock unit represents the right to receive one share of the Company’s common stock following the completion of a director’s service.

During fiscal year 2021, the Company granted 11,000 deferred stock units, reinvested dividends of 4,000 units and distributed 31,000 shares, which had a weighted-average fair value on the grant date of $199.50, $198.51 and $83.24 per share, respectively. As of June 30, 2021, 174,000 units were outstanding, which had a weighted-average fair value on the grant date of $106.62 per share.

A reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate on operations follows for the fiscal years ended June 30:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Per U.S. GAAP, foreign withholding taxes are provided on unremitted foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested at the time the earnings are generated. The Company regularly reviews and assesses whether there are any changes to its indefinite reinvestment assertion. Through the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company had determined that the undistributed earnings of a number of its foreign subsidiaries were indefinitely reinvested. When the Tax Act was passed into law in December 2017, it significantly reduced the cost of U.S. repatriation. In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, the Company concluded an analysis wherein it determined that none of the undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries were indefinitely reinvested. As a result, the Company is providing foreign withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of all foreign subsidiaries where applicable. These withholding taxes had no significant impact on the Company’s consolidated results.
