Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION  

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, or MD&A, provides management’s views on our financial condition and results of operations, should be read in conjunction with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto, and includes the following sections:  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES  

We report our financial results in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP, and also communicate with investors using certain 

non-GAAP financial measures. These 

non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, nor are they a substitute for or superior to, the comparable GAAP financial measures. These 

non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement presentation of our financial results that are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Based upon feedback from investors and financial analysts, we believe that the supplemental 

non-GAAP financial measures we provide are useful to their assessments of our performance and operating trends, as well as liquidity.  

Our 

non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain events, activities or strategic decisions. The accounting effects of these events, activities or decisions, which are included in the GAAP financial measures, may make it difficult to assess our underlying performance in a single period. By excluding the accounting effects, positive or negative, of certain items (e.g., restructuring charges, legal settlements, certain effects of strategic transactions and related costs, losses from debt extinguishments, gains or losses from curtailment or settlement of pension obligations, gains or losses on sales of certain assets, and other items), we believe that we are providing meaningful supplemental information that facilitates an understanding of our core operating results and liquidity measures. While some of the items we exclude from GAAP financial measures recur, they tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing.  

We use these 

non-GAAP financial measures internally to evaluate trends in our underlying performance, as well as to facilitate comparison to the results of competitors for a single period and full year, as applicable.  

We use the following 

non-GAAP financial measures in this MD&A:  

   •    

Sales change ex. currency refers to the increase or decrease in net sales, excluding the estimated impact of foreign currency translation, and, where applicable, an extra week in our fiscal year, currency adjustment for transitional reporting of highly inflationary economies, and the reclassification of sales between segments. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated on a constant currency basis, with prior period results translated at current period average exchange rates to exclude the effect of currency fluctuations.     

   •    

Organic sales change refers to sales change ex. currency, excluding the estimated impact of product line exits, acquisitions and divestitures.     

We believe that sales change ex. currency and organic sales change assist investors in evaluating the sales change from the ongoing activities of our businesses and enhance their ability to evaluate our results from period to period.  

   •    

Free cash flow refers to cash flow provided by operating activities, less payments for property, plant and equipment, software and other deferred charges, plus proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, plus (minus) net proceeds from insurance and sales (purchases) of investments. Free cash flow is also adjusted for, where applicable, the cash contributions related to the termination of our U.S. pension plan. We believe that free cash flow assists investors by showing the amount of cash we have available for debt reductions, dividends, share repurchases, and acquisitions.     

   •    

Operational working capital as a percentage of annualized current quarter net sales refers to trade accounts receivable and inventories, net of accounts payable, and excludes cash and cash equivalents, short-term borrowings, deferred taxes, other current assets and other current liabilities, as well as net current assets or liabilities 

held-for-sale divided by annualized current quarter net sales. We believe that operational working capital as a percentage of annualized

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

current quarter net sales assists investors in assessing our working capital requirements because it excludes the impact of fluctuations attributable to our financing and other activities (which affect cash and cash equivalents, deferred taxes, other current assets, and other current liabilities) that tend to be disparate in amount, frequency, or timing, and that may increase the volatility of working capital as a percentage of sales from period to period. The items excluded from this measure are not significantly influenced by our 

day-to-day activities managed at the operating level and do not necessarily reflect the underlying trends in our operations.     

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK  

COVID-19 Pandemic  

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of 

coronavirus/COVID-19 (collectively referred to herein as 

“COVID-19”) a pandemic, which has continued spreading throughout the U.S. and the world, resulting in governmental authorities implementing numerous containment measures, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, 

shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns.  

The safety and well-being of our employees has been and will continue to be our top priority during this global crisis, followed immediately by continuing to deliver high quality products and service to our customers. We created global, regional, and local emergency response teams to manage immediate priorities, recognizing that some of our businesses serve a critical role in supply chains for essential goods such as food, hygiene, and pharmaceutical products, as well as 

e-commerce. To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities, the majority of our office-based employees continue to work remotely and some of our operations limited production or ceased operations for short periods of time. We leveraged learnings from our early experience in China to develop safety protocols for our manufacturing facilities to 

re-open and/or remain operational, and established work-from-home protocols for office workers. To support the well-being of our employees, we ensured that they continued to receive full pay during the initial weeks of facility closures, and, where closures were later extended in jurisdictions with weaker social safety nets, particularly in our Retail Branding and Information Solutions (“RBIS”) reportable segment, provided longer periods of salary continuation. In addition, in the fourth quarter we provided supplemental payments to our front-line workers to express gratitude for their having served our customers’ essential needs and increased our level of community investment, by making a $10 million contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation in support of charitable causes.  

To meet our customer needs during periods of peak demand for label and packaging materials in North America and Europe, we took a number of steps to reduce backlogs, including leveraging our operational excellence to maximize production capacity, providing pay premiums for certain hourly employees, and temporarily allocating a portion of coating assets that normally support our graphics business to manufacture material for labels.  

Overall, we have experienced negligible disruptions to our supply chain. As the largest customer for many of our suppliers, we have been able to secure continuity of material supply, while benefitting from our global footprint with dual sourcing for most commodities.  

Overall, the pandemic had a negative impact on our consolidated financial results for 2020. While we experienced sequential improvements in the second half of the year, 2020 net sales were lower across our reportable segments due to the negative impact of the pandemic. Net sales for the second quarter of 2020 were down approximately 15% from the same period in 2019. However, we experienced sequential improvement in the second half of the year, with net sales for the full year down over 1% from the prior year. Our label and packaging materials largely serve essential categories and experienced strong demand as a result of the pandemic, given increased consumption of packaged goods and use of 

e-commerce. Net sales of graphics and reflective products declined due to lower demand. Net sales in RBIS reportable segment declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020, though we experienced sequential improvement in the remainder of the year, driven by net sales growth in radio-frequency identification (“RFID”) solutions and improvement in the base business. Additionally, net sales in our Industrial and Healthcare Materials (“IHM”) reportable segment declined significantly in the second quarter mainly due to reduced industrial demand, particularly in automotive end markets, although we experienced sequential improvement in the remainder of the year.  

We are unable to predict the full impact that 

COVID-19 will have on our 2021 results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and containment measures and the related macroeconomic impacts. We continue to actively manage this dynamic environment and update our scenario planning to reflect the continuously evolving aspects of the pandemic.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

We executed various long-term productivity and temporary cost saving actions to manage the downturn, including deferrals of planned compensation increases, hiring freezes, overtime and temporary labor reductions, shift reductions and furloughs, temporary production shutdowns, and travel and other discretionary spending reductions. Our temporary cost saving actions resulted in approximately $135 million of savings in 2020; we anticipate the majority of these costs to return as markets recover. While our balance sheet is strong and we have ample liquidity, during the first quarter of 2020, we drew down $500 million under our $800 million revolving credit facility (“Revolver”) because commercial paper markets were temporarily unavailable as a result of the pandemic. During the second quarter, we were able to access commercial paper markets and repaid the entire $500 million we had drawn down from our Revolver. Additionally, we heightened our focus on working capital management. We paused share repurchase activity in March 2020 and resumed repurchases late in the third quarter of 2020. In the initial stages of the pandemic, we maintained our dividend rate; in October, we increased the rate by approximately 7%. We expect that our current cash and cash equivalents and the cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements through this downturn.  

We continue to actively monitor the 

COVID-19 situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.  

Fiscal Year  

Normally, our fiscal years consist of 52 weeks, but every fifth or sixth fiscal year consists of 53 weeks. Our 2020 fiscal year consisted of a 

53-week period ending January 2, 2021. Our 2019 and 2018 fiscal years consisted of 

52-week periods ending December 28, 2019, and December 29, 2018, respectively.  

Net Sales  

The factors impacting the reported sales change are shown in the table below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  

Totals may not sum due to rounding     

In 2020, net sales decreased on an organic basis primarily due to the impact of 

COVID-19 on our markets and customers. In 2019, net sales increased on an organic basis primarily due to a combination of higher volume/mix and pricing actions.  

Net Income  

Net income increased from approximately $304 million in 2019 to approximately $556 million in 2020. The major factors affecting the change in net income in 2020 compared to 2019 were:  

   •    

Prior-year settlement loss from U.S. pension plan termination     

   •    

Benefits from productivity initiatives, including temporary cost reduction actions, and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs     

   •    

Net impact of pricing and raw material input costs     

Offsetting factors:  

   •    

Lower sales and unfavorable product mix primarily due to the impact of 

COVID-19     

   •    

Higher employee-related costs     

Acquisitions  

Subsequent to our fiscal 

year-end 2020, in February 2021, we announced our agreement to acquire JDC Solutions, Inc., a Tennessee-based manufacturer of pressure-sensitive specialty tapes, for a purchase price of approximately $24 million, subject to customary adjustments. We believe this acquisition expands the product portfolio in our IHM reportable segment. We expect to complete this acquisition in the first quarter of 2021.  

On December 31, 2020, we completed our acquisition of ACPO, Ltd. (“ACPO”), an Ohio-based manufacturer of self-wound (linerless) pressure-sensitive overlaminate products, for consideration of approximately $88 million, subject to customary adjustments. We believe this acquisition expands our product portfolio in the North American business of our Label and Graphic Materials (“LGM”) reportable segment. Consistent with the time allowed to complete our assessment, our valuation of certain acquired assets and liabilities, including tangible and intangible assets and environmental liabilities, is preliminary.  

On February 28, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Smartrac’s Transponder (RFID Inlay) division (“Smartrac”), a manufacturer of RFID products, for consideration of approximately $255 million (

€232 million). We believe this acquisition enhances our research and development capabilities, expands our product lines, and provides added manufacturing capacity. Results for Smartrac’s operations were included in our RBIS reportable segment.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

These acquisitions were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Cost Reduction Actions  

2019/2020 Actions  

During fiscal year 2020, we recorded $56 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, related to our 2019/2020 actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 2,160 positions and asset impairment charges at numerous locations across our company, which primarily included actions in our LGM and RBIS reportable segments. The actions in our LGM reportable segment were primarily associated with consolidations of operations in North America and its graphics business in Europe, in part in response to 

COVID-19. The actions in our RBIS reportable segment were primarily related to global headcount and footprint reduction, with some actions accelerated and expanded in response to 

COVID-19. During fiscal year 2019, we recorded $25.2 million in restructuring charges related to our 2019/2020 actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 370 positions, as well as asset impairment charges.  

2018/2019 Actions  

In April 2018, we approved a restructuring plan (the “2018 Plan”) to consolidate the European footprint of our LGM reportable segment, which reduced headcount by approximately 390 positions, including temporary labor, in connection with the closure of a manufacturing facility. This reduction was partially offset by headcount additions in other locations, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 150 positions. During fiscal year 2020 and 2019, net restructuring reversals related to the 2018 Plan were not material. The cumulative charges associated with the 2018 Plan consisted of severance and related costs for the headcount reduction, as well as asset impairment charges. The activities related to the 2018 Plan were substantially completed as of the end of the second quarter of 2019.  

Net restructuring reversals during fiscal year 2020 that related to other 2018/2019 actions, were not material. During fiscal year 2019, we recorded $28.2 million in restructuring charges, net of reversals, relating to these other 2018/2019 actions. These charges consisted of severance and related costs for the reduction of approximately 490 positions, as well as asset impairment charges.  

Impact of Cost Reduction Actions  

During fiscal year 2020, we realized approximately $65 million in savings, net of transition costs, primarily from our 2019/2020 actions. During fiscal year 2019, we realized approximately $50 million in savings, net of transition costs, primarily from our 2018/2019 actions.  

Restructuring charges were included in “Other expense (income), net” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 13, “Cost Reduction Actions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

U.S. Pension Plan Termination  

In 2019, we terminated the Avery Dennison Pension Plan (the “ADPP”), a U.S. defined benefit plan. In connection with this termination, we settled approximately $753 million of ADPP liabilities by entering into an agreement to purchase annuities primarily from American General Life Insurance Company and through a combination of annuities and direct funding to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation for a small portion of former employees and their beneficiaries. These settlements resulted in approximately $444 million of pretax charges in 2019, partially offset by related tax benefits of approximately $179 million.  

Refer to Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Accounting Guidance Updates  

Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for this information.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

In 2020, cash flow provided by operating activities increased compared to 2019 primarily due to higher net income, lower pension plan contributions, lower payroll and incentive compensation payments, and lower severance payments related to restructuring actions, partially offset by higher income tax payments, net of refunds, and changes in operational working capital primarily related to the timing of vendor payments. In 2020, free cash flow increased compared to 2019 primarily due to reduced purchases of software and other deferred charges and purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by lower cash provided by operating activities adjusted for our contribution to the ADPP.  

Outlook  

In addition to the continued uncertain impact of 

COVID-19 on our businesses, certain factors that we believe may contribute to our 2021 results are described below:  

   •    

We expect net sales to increase by 5% to 9%, including the impact of the Smartrac and ACPO acquisitions, reflecting continued recovery in our 

end-markets across our reportable segments.     

   •    

We anticipate the effect of the extra week in 2020 will decrease net sales by approximately 1%.     

   •    

We anticipate the majority of the temporary cost-saving actions in 2020 to return as markets recover.     

   •    

We anticipate incremental savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, of approximately $70 million.     

   •    

We expect our full year effective tax rate to be in the 

mid-twenty percent range.     

   •    

Based on recent foreign currency exchange rates, we expect foreign currency translation to increase our net sales by approximately 2% and our operating income by approximately $25 million.     

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Gross Profit Margin  

Gross profit margin in 2020 increased compared to 2019 primarily reflecting the net benefit of pricing and raw material input costs and the benefits from productivity initiatives, including temporary cost reduction actions, material 

re-engineering and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, partially offset by the net impact of lower volume and unfavorable product mix.  

Gross profit margin in 2019 increased slightly compared to 2018 reflecting benefits from productivity initiatives, including material 

re-engineering and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, partially offset by the net impact of higher employee-related costs and unfavorable volume/mix.  

Marketing, General and Administrative Expense  

Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to benefits from productivity initiatives, including temporary cost reduction actions, and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, as well as, favorable foreign currency translation, partially offset by the impact of the Smartrac acquisition, increased allowance for credit losses and the contribution to the Avery Dennison Foundation.  

Marketing, general and administrative expense decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 reflecting the benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher employee-related costs and growth investments.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Refer to Note 13, “Cost Reduction Actions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Interest Expense  

Interest expense decreased approximately $5.8 million in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily reflecting lower borrowing rates on our outstanding indebtedness.  

Interest expense increased approximately $17.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018, reflecting additional interest costs related to the $500 million of senior notes we issued in December 2018.  

Other 

Non-Operating Expense (Income), Net  

Other 

non-operating expense, net, decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the prior-year impact of the ADPP termination. In 2019, we recorded approximately $444 million of final settlement charges related to the termination of the ADPP, which increased other 

non-operating expense compared to 2018.  

Refer to Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” and Note 14, “Taxes Based on Income,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes  

Our effective tax rate in 2020 increased compared to 2019, while our effective tax rate in 2019 decreased compared to 2018, primarily due to the tax effects of the settlement charges associated with the termination of the ADPP and a discrete foreign structuring transaction in 2019. Moreover, our effective tax rate in 2018 reflected tax benefits related to adjustments to our 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) provisional amount and a discrete foreign tax planning action.  

We expect our effective tax rate for 2021 to be in the 

mid-twenty percent range. Our effective tax rate can vary from period to period due to the recognition of discrete events, such as changes in tax reserves, settlements of income tax audits, changes in tax laws and regulations, 

return-to-provision adjustments, and tax impacts related to stock-based payments, as well as recurring factors, such as changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and the execution of tax planning strategies.  

We continue to pursue planning opportunities in certain foreign jurisdictions, some of which are to react to the loss of concessionary tax rates in prior years. For example, in 2020, we reached a tax incentive settlement agreement with a foreign tax authority related to self-developed intellectual property. We remain focused on advancing our progress towards the realization of additional opportunities.  

Refer to Note 14, “Taxes Based on Income,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

In 2020, net sales decreased on an organic basis primarily due to raw material deflation-related price reductions, which more than offset higher volume/mix. On an organic basis, net sales increased by a 

low-single digit rate in emerging markets and North America and decreased by a 

low-to-mid single digit rate in Western Europe.  

In 2019, net sales increased on an organic basis primarily due to prior year pricing actions. On an organic basis, net sales increased by a 

low-single digit rate in emerging markets and were comparable to prior year in North America and Western Europe.  

Operating Income  

Operating income increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to benefits from productivity initiatives, including temporary cost reduction actions, material 

re-engineering and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, and benefits from raw material deflation, net of pricing and the impact of the extra week in our 2020 fiscal year. These benefits were partially offset by higher employee-related costs, unfavorable volume/mix and increased allowance for credit losses.  

Operating income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to benefits from productivity initiatives, including material 

re-engineering and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, and lower restructuring charges, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and the combined effect of volume/mix.

Net Sales  

The factors impacting reported sales change are shown in the table below.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

 (1)  

Totals may not sum due to rounding     

In 2020, sales ex. currency decreased from the prior year due to a 

mid-teens rate decline in the base business driven by temporary closures of apparel manufacturing sites and lower demand for apparel, partially offset by an approximate 40% increase in RFID solutions in the segment, including the benefit of the Smartrac acquisition. The substantial majority of our sales of RFID solutions is reported within our RBIS reportable segment. On an organic basis, sales in the segment related to RFID solutions increased by a 

mid-single digit rate. Company-wide, sales of RFID solutions increased on an organic basis at a high-single digit rate.  

In 2019, net sales increased on an organic basis primarily due to continued strength in RFID solutions and external embellishments.  

Operating Income  

Operating income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower volume, higher long-term growth-related investments, including costs associated with the Smartrac acquisition, higher restructuring charges and increased allowance for credit losses, partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including temporary cost reduction actions and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs.  

Operating income increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher volume and benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, partially offset by higher employee-related costs.

In 2019, net sales were comparable to prior year on an organic basis.  

Operating Income  

Operating income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to lower volume, partially offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including temporary cost reduction actions and savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs.  

Operating income decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher restructuring charges and a prior-year reversal of acquisition-related contingent consideration, as well as higher employee-related costs, largely offset by benefits from productivity initiatives, including savings from restructuring actions, net of transition costs, and the net benefit of pricing and raw material costs.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2020, cash flow provided by operating activities increased compared to 2019 primarily due to higher net income, lower pension plan contributions, lower payroll and incentive compensation payments, and lower severance payments related to restructuring actions, partially offset by higher income tax payments, net of refunds, and changes in operational working capital primarily related to the timing of vendor payments.  

In 2019, cash flow provided by operating activities increased compared to 2018 primarily due to lower pension plan contributions, improved operational working capital, and lower incentive compensation payments, partially offset by higher severance payments related to restructuring actions.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Purchases of Property, Plant and Equipment  

In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we invested in equipment and expanded manufacturing facilities to support growth, and productivity improvements primarily in the U.S. and certain countries in Asia, including Thailand, India, and China, for our LGM reportable segment and in China, the U.S., and Malaysia for our RBIS reportable segment. 

Purchases of Software and Other Deferred Charges  

In 2020 and 2019, we invested in information technology upgrades worldwide. In 2019, we also invested in enterprise resource planning system implementations in North America. In 2018, we invested in enterprise resource planning system implementations in North America and Asia.  

Proceeds from Sales of Property, Plant and Equipment  

In 2020, the majority of the proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment was related to the sale of a property in Europe. In 2019, the majority of the proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment was related to the sale of three properties in North America, Asia and Europe. In 2018, the majority of the proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment was related to the sale of two properties in Europe.  

Proceeds from Insurance and Sales (Purchases) of Investments, Net  

In 2020 and 2019, we had lower proceeds from insurance associated with our company-owned life insurance policies, partially offset by lower net (purchases) sales of investments compared to the prior year.  

Payments for Acquisitions, Net of Cash Acquired, and Investments in Businesses  

In 2020, we paid consideration, net of cash acquired, of approximately $255 million to acquire Smartrac, which we initially funded through commercial paper borrowings, and approximately $88 million to acquire ACPO. We also invested in certain strategic unconsolidated businesses in 2020, 2019 and 2018.  

Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Borrowings and Repayment of Debt  

During 2020, 2019, and 2018, our commercial paper borrowings were used for dividend payments, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and other general corporate purposes. During 2020, commercial paper borrowings were also used for the Smartrac acquisition, with those borrowings subsequently repaid using a portion of the net proceeds of $493.7 million from the $500 million of senior notes we issued in March 2020. We used the remaining proceeds from these notes to repay the $250 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes that matured in April 2020. We also repaid $15 million of medium-term notes that matured in June 2020.  

In the first quarter of 2020, in light of uncertainty as a result of 

COVID-19 regarding the availability of commercial paper, which we typically rely upon to fund our 

day-to-day operational needs, and the relatively favorable terms under our recently-extended $800 million Revolver, we borrowed $500 million from the Revolver with a 

six-month duration. We repaid this amount in June 2020.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

In December 2018, we issued $500 million of senior notes, due December 2028. These senior notes bear an interest rate of 4.875% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears. The net proceeds from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, were $493.3 million, which we used to repay commercial paper borrowings. Prior to the issuance of these senior notes, we used commercial paper borrowings to fund our $200 million contribution to the ADPP in connection with its termination.  

Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions,” and Note 4, “Debt,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

We paid dividends per share of $2.36, $2.26, and $2.01 in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. In October 2020, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.62 per share, representing an increase of approximately 7% from our previous dividend rate of $.58 per share. In April 2019, we increased our quarterly dividend to $.58 per share, representing an increase of approximately 12% from our previous dividend rate of $.52 per share.  

Share Repurchases  

From time to time, our Board authorizes the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock. Repurchased shares may be reissued under our long-term incentive plan or used for other corporate purposes. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repurchased approximately .8 million, 2 million, and 4 million shares of our common stock, respectively. We temporarily paused share repurchase activity in March 2020 as a result of 

COVID-19 and resumed repurchases late in the third quarter of 2020.  

In April 2019, our Board authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock with a fair market value of up to $650 million, exclusive of any fees, commissions or other expenses related to such purchases, in addition to the amount outstanding under our previous Board authorization. Board authorizations remain in effect until shares in the amount authorized thereunder have been repurchased. As of January 2, 2021, shares of our common stock in the aggregate amount of $540.4 million remained authorized for repurchase under this Board authorization.  

Net (Tax Withholding) Proceeds Related to Stock-Based Compensation  

In 2020, proceeds from stock option exercises decreased while tax withholding for stock-based compensation also decreased compared to 2019 primarily as a result of fewer vesting of equity awards. In 2019, proceeds from stock option exercises increased while tax withholding for stock-based compensation decreased compared to 2018 as a result of equity awards vesting at lower share prices.  

Approximately .05 million, .3 million, and .03 million stock options were exercised in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Refer to Note 12, “Long-Term Incentive Compensation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Analysis of Selected Balance Sheet Accounts  

Long-lived Assets  

Property, plant and equipment, net, increased by approximately $133 million to $1.34 billion at 

year-end 2020, which primarily reflected purchases of property, plant and equipment, the acquisitions of Smartrac and ACPO, and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by depreciation expense.  

Goodwill increased by approximately $206 million to $1.14 billion at 

year-end 2020, which reflected acquired goodwill associated with the Smartrac and ACPO acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translation.  

Other intangibles resulting from business acquisitions, net, increased by approximately $98 million to $224.9 million at 

year-end 2020, which reflected the valuations of other intangibles from the acquisitions of Smartrac and ACPO and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by amortization expense.  

Refer to Note 3, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles Resulting from Business Acquisitions,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Shareholders’ Equity Accounts  

The balance of our shareholders’ equity increased by approximately $281 million to $1.48 billion at 

year-end 2020. Refer to Note 11, “Supplemental Equity and Comprehensive Income Information,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Impact of Foreign Currency Translation  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In 2020, international operations generated approximately 76% of our net sales. Our future results are subject to changes in political and economic conditions in the regions in which we operate and the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on net sales in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily related to sales in Brazil, India and Mexico, partially offset by euro-denominated sales.  

On July 1, 2018, we began accounting for our operations in Argentina as highly inflationary, as the country’s three-year cumulative inflation rate exceeded 100%. As a result, the functional currency of our Argentine subsidiary became the U.S. dollar.  

Effect of Foreign Currency Transactions  

The impact on net income from transactions denominated in foreign currencies is largely mitigated because the costs of our products are generally denominated in the same currencies in which they are sold. In addition, to reduce our income and cash flow exposure to transactions in foreign currencies, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts where available and appropriate. We also utilized certain foreign-currency-denominated debt to mitigate our foreign currency translation exposure from our net investment in foreign operations. Refer to Note 5, “Financial Instruments,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Analysis of Selected Financial Ratios  

We utilize the financial ratios discussed below to assess our financial condition and operating performance. We believe this information assists our investors in understanding drivers of our cash flow other than net income and capital expenditures.  

Operational Working Capital Ratio  

Operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, is reconciled to working capital below. Our objective is to minimize our investment in operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, to maximize our cash flow and return on investment. Operational working capital, as a percentage of annualized current-quarter net sales, in 2020 was higher compared to 2019.  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Accounts Receivable Ratio  

The average number of days sales outstanding was 61 days in 2020 compared to 62 days in 2019, calculated using the accounts receivable balance at 

year-end divided by the average daily sales in the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in average number of days sales outstanding primarily reflected focused collection results, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.  

Inventory Ratio  

Average inventory turnover was 7.3 in 2020 compared to 7.8 in 2019, calculated using the annualized fourth-quarter cost of products sold in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and divided by the inventory balance at 

year-end. The decrease in average inventory turnover primarily reflected the timing of inventory purchases.  

Accounts Payable Ratio  

The average number of days payable outstanding was 73 days in 2020 compared to 75 days in 2019, calculated using the accounts payable balance at 

year-end divided by the annualized fourth-quarter cost of products sold in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The decrease in average number of days payable outstanding primarily reflected the timing of vendor payments, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Capital Resources  

Capital resources include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents and debt financing, including access to commercial paper supported by our Revolver. We use these resources to fund operational needs.  

At 

year-end 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $252.3 million held in accounts at third-party financial institutions. Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world. At 

year-end 2020, the majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries.  

To meet U.S. cash requirements, we have several cost-effective liquidity options available. These options include borrowing funds at reasonable rates, including borrowings from foreign subsidiaries, and repatriating foreign earnings and profits. However, if we were to repatriate foreign earnings and profits, a portion would be subject to cash payments of withholding taxes imposed by foreign tax authorities. Additional U.S. taxes may also result from the impact of foreign currency movements related to these earnings and profits. Refer to Note 14, “Taxes Based on Income,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

In February 2020, we amended and restated the Revolver, eliminating one of the financial covenants and extending its maturity date to February 13, 2025. The maturity date may be extended for a 

one-year period under certain circumstances. The commitments under the Revolver may be increased by up to $400 million, subject to lender approvals and customary requirements. The Revolver is used as a 

back-up facility for our commercial paper program and can be used for other corporate purposes.  

The Revolver contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (calculated as a ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA as defined in the agreement) of not more than 3.50 to 1.00; provided that, in the event of an acquisition by us that exceeds $250 million, the maximum leverage ratio increases to 4.00 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition occurs and three consecutive fiscal quarters immediately following that fiscal quarter. As of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, our ratio was substantially below the maximum ratio allowed by the Revolver.  

In addition to the Revolver, we have significant short-term lines of credit available in various countries of approximately $390 million in the aggregate at January 2, 2021. These lines may be cancelled at any time by us or the issuing banks. Short-term borrowings outstanding under our lines of credit were $22.2 million and $37.4 million at January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% and 6.4%, respectively.  

Refer to Note 4, “Debt,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates, and to possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties.  

Capital from Debt  

The carrying value of our total debt increased by approximately $177 million to $2.12 billion at 

year-end 2020 compared to $1.94 billion at 

year-end 2019, primarily reflecting our issuance of senior notes in March 2020, partially offset by long- and medium-term debt repayments in the second quarter of 2020 and a net decrease in commercial paper borrowings.  

Credit ratings are a significant factor in our ability to raise short- and long-term financing. The credit ratings assigned to us also impact the interest rates we pay and our access to commercial paper, credit facilities, and other borrowings. A downgrade of our short-term credit ratings could impact our ability to access commercial paper markets. If our access to commercial paper markets were to become limited, as it did in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of 

COVID-19, we believe that the Revolver and our other credit facilities would be available to meet our short-term funding requirements. When determining a credit rating, we believe that rating agencies primarily consider our competitive position, business outlook, consistency of cash flows, debt level and liquidity, geographic dispersion and management team. There has been no change to the credit ratings assigned to us as a result of 

COVID-19. We remain committed to maintaining an investment grade rating.  

Fair Value of Debt  

The estimated fair value of our long-term debt is primarily based on the credit spread above U.S. Treasury securities or euro government bond securities, as applicable, on notes with similar rates, credit ratings, and remaining maturities. The fair value of short-term borrowings, which includes commercial paper issuances and short-term lines of credit, approximates carrying value given the short duration of these obligations. The fair value of our total debt was $2.34 billion at January 2, 2021 and $2.05 billion at December 28, 2019. Fair value amounts were determined based primarily on Level 2 inputs, which are inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable. Refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Contractual Obligations at End of Year 2020  

  [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The table above does not include:  

   •    

Purchase obligations or open purchase orders at 

year-end – It is impracticable for us to obtain or provide a reasonable estimate of this information due to the decentralized nature of our purchasing systems. In addition, purchase orders are generally entered into at fair value and cancelable without penalty.     

   •    

Cash funding requirements for pension benefits payable to certain eligible current and future retirees under our funded plans – Benefits under our funded pension plans are paid through trusts or trust equivalents. Cash funding requirements for our funded plans, which can be significantly impacted by earnings on investments, the discount rate, changes in the plans, and funding laws and regulations, are not included as we are not able to estimate required contributions to the trusts or trust equivalents. Refer to Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our expected contributions to these plans and plan terminations and settlements.     

   •    

Pension and postretirement benefit payments – We have unfunded benefit obligations related to defined benefit plans. Refer to Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information, including our expected benefit payments over the next 10 years.    

   •    

Deferred compensation plan benefit payments – It is impracticable for us to obtain a reasonable estimate for 2020 and beyond due to the volatility of payment amounts and certain events that could trigger immediate payment of benefits to participants. In addition, participant account balances are 

marked-to-market monthly and benefit payments are adjusted annually. Refer to Note 6, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.     

   •    

Cash-based awards to employees under incentive compensation plans – The amounts to be paid to employees under these awards are based on our stock price and, as applicable, achievement of certain performance objectives as of the end of their respective performance periods. Therefore, we cannot reasonably estimate the amounts to be paid on the respective vesting dates. Refer to Note 12, “Long-term Incentive Compensation,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expense. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Critical accounting estimates are those that are important to our financial condition and results, and which require us to make difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments. Critical accounting estimates cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because their future resolution is unknown. We believe our critical accounting estimates include accounting for goodwill, pension and postretirement benefits, taxes based on income, and long-term incentive compensation.  

Goodwill  

Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method, with the excess of the acquisition cost over the fair value of net tangible assets and identified intangible assets acquired considered goodwill. As a result, we disclose goodwill separately from other intangible assets. Our reporting units are composed of either a discrete business or an aggregation of businesses with similar economic characteristics. We perform an annual impairment test of goodwill during the fourth quarter. In performing the impairment tests, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for goodwill impairment. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is 

more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative assessment. A quantitative assessment primarily consists of a present value (discounted cash flow) method to determine the fair value of reporting units with goodwill.  

Certain factors may cause us to perform an impairment test prior to the fourth quarter, including significant underperformance of a business relative to expected operating results, significant adverse economic and industry trends, significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time relative to net book value, or a decision to divest a portion of a reporting unit.  

We compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and, to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the unit’s fair value, we recognize an impairment of goodwill for the excess up to the amount of goodwill of that reporting unit.  

In consultation with outside specialists, we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis requires us to make various assumptions about our reporting units, including their respective forecasted sales, operating margins and growth rates, as well as discount rates. Assumptions about discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital for comparable companies. Assumptions about sales, operating margins, and growth rates are based on our forecasts, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, and marketplace data. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. We base our fair value estimates on projected financial information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable. However, actual future results may materially differ from these estimates and projections. The valuation methodology we use to estimate the fair value of reporting units requires inputs and assumptions that reflect current market conditions, as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies that require management judgment. The estimated fair value could increase or decrease depending on changes in the inputs and assumptions.  

In our annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2020, the goodwill of one reporting unit in our LGM reportable segment was tested utilizing a qualitative assessment. Based on this assessment, we determined that the fair value of this reporting unit was 

more-likely-than-not greater than its carrying value. Therefore, the goodwill of this reporting unit was not impaired.  

Additionally, in our annual 2020 impairment analysis, the goodwill of one reporting unit in our Label and Graphic Materials reportable segment and all reporting units in our Industrial and Healthcare Materials and Retail Branding and Information Solutions reportable segments were tested utilizing a quantitative assessment. This assessment indicated that the fair values of these reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts, including goodwill, by more than 100% and the goodwill of these reporting units was not impaired.  

Pension and Postretirement Benefits  

Assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets for our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans are evaluated by management in consultation with outside actuaries. In the event that we determine that  

 Avery Dennison Corporation    |    2020 Annual Report           

17   

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

changes are warranted in the assumptions used, such as the discount rate, expected long-term rate of return, or health care costs, future pension and postretirement benefit expenses could increase or decrease. Due to changes in market conditions or participant population, the actuarial assumptions that we use may differ from actual results, which could have a significant impact on our pension and postretirement liability and related costs.  

Discount Rate  

In consultation with our actuaries, we annually review and determine the discount rates to be used in valuing our postretirement obligations. The assumed discount rates for our international pension plans reflect market rates for high quality corporate bonds currently available. Our discount rates are determined by evaluating yield curves consisting of large populations of high quality corporate bonds. The projected pension benefit payment streams are then matched with the bond portfolios to determine a rate that reflects the liability duration unique to our plans. As of January 2, 2021, a .25% increase in the discount rates associated with our international plans would have decreased our 

year-end projected benefit obligation by $50 million and increased expected periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $2 million. Conversely, a .25% decrease in the discount rates associated with our international plans would have increased our 

year-end projected benefit obligation by approximately $50 million and decreased expected periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $2 million.  

We use the full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Under this approach, we apply multiple discount rates from a yield curve composed of the rates of return on several hundred high-quality, fixed income corporate bonds available at the measurement date. We believe this approach provides a more precise measurement of service and interest cost by aligning the timing of the plans’ liability cash flows to the corresponding rates on the yield curve.  

Long-term Return on Plan Assets  

We determine the long-term rate of return assumption for plan assets by reviewing the historical and expected returns of both the equity and fixed income markets, taking into account our asset allocation, the correlation between returns in our asset classes, and our mix of active and passive investments. Additionally, current market conditions, including interest rates, are evaluated and market data is reviewed for reasonableness and appropriateness. An increase or decrease of .25% on the long-term return on assets associated with our international plans would have decreased or increased our periodic benefit cost for the coming year by approximately $2 million.  

Taxes Based on Income  

We are subject to income tax in the U.S. and multiple foreign jurisdictions, whereby judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our worldwide provision, accruals for taxes, deferred taxes and for evaluating our tax positions. Our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach in accordance with GAAP. Deferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years. These assets arise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. These amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse. We evaluate the realizability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the period over which recoverability is allowed by law and the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. Our assessment of these sources of income relies heavily on estimates. Our forecasted earnings by jurisdiction are determined by how we operate our business and any changes to our operations may affect our effective tax rate. For example, our future income tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions in which we have significant deferred tax assets that are dependent on such earnings to be realized. We use historical experience along with operating forecasts to evaluate expected future taxable income. To the extent we do not consider it 

more-likely-than-not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is established in the period we make that determination. Tax planning strategies are defined as “actions that: are prudent and feasible; an entity ordinarily might not take, but would take to prevent an operating loss or tax credit carryforward from expiring unused; and would result in realization of deferred tax assets.”  

Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the different tax rates applicable in the jurisdictions in which we do business.  

We calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ  

18       2020 Annual Report    |    Avery Dennison Corporation   

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  

Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed in subsequent years. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified.  

Tax laws and regulations are complex and subject to different interpretations by taxpayers and governmental taxing authorities. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. Our estimate of the potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is subject to our assessment of relevant facts and circumstances existing at the balance sheet date, taking into consideration existing laws, regulations and practices of the governmental authorities exercising jurisdiction over our operations. We recognize and measure our uncertain tax positions following the 

more-likely-than-not threshold for recognition and measurement for tax positions we take or expect to take on a tax return. For example, we continue to monitor developments regarding the European Commission state aid investigations, for jurisdictions in which we have significant operations, such as the Netherlands and Luxembourg.  

Refer to Note 14, “Taxes Based on Income,” to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  

Long-Term Incentive Compensation  

Valuation of Stock-Based Awards  

We base our stock-based compensation expense on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for stock options and restricted stock units (“RSUs”). We base compensation expense for performance units (“PUs”) on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and amortized on a straight-line basis as these awards cliff-vest at the end of the requisite service period. We base compensation expense related to market-leveraged stock units (“MSUs”) on the fair value of awards, adjusted for estimated forfeitures, and amortized on a graded-vesting basis over their respective performance periods.  

Compensation expense for awards with a market condition as a performance objective, which includes PUs and MSUs, is not adjusted if the condition is not met, as long as the requisite service period is met.  

We estimated the fair value of stock options as of the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. This model requires input assumptions for our expected dividend yield, expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and the expected option term. No stock options were granted in fiscal years 2020, 2019 or 2018.  

We determine the fair value of RSUs and the component of PUs that is subject to the achievement of a performance objective based on a financial performance condition based on the fair market value of our common stock as of the date of the grant, adjusted for foregone dividends. Over the performance period of the PUs, the estimated number of shares of our common stock issuable upon vesting is adjusted upward or downward from the target shares at the time of grant based on the probability of the performance objectives established for the award being achieved.  

We determine the fair value of stock-based awards that are subject to achievement of performance objectives based on a market condition, which includes MSUs and the other component of PUs, using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which utilizes multiple input variables, including expected stock price volatility and other assumptions appropriate for determining fair value, to estimate the probability of satisfying the target performance objectives established for the award.  

Forfeiture Rate  

Changes in estimated forfeiture rates are recorded as cumulative adjustments in the period estimates are revised.  

Certain of these assumptions are based on management’s estimates, in consultation with outside specialists. Significant changes in assumptions for future awards and actual forfeiture rates could materially impact stock-based compensation expense and our results of operations.  

Valuation of Cash-Based Awards  

Cash-based awards consist of long-term incentive units (“LTI Units”) granted to eligible employees. LTI Units are classified as liability awards and remeasured at each 

quarter-end over the applicable vesting or performance period. In addition to LTI Units with terms and conditions that mirror those of RSUs, we also grant certain employees LTI Units with terms and conditions that mirror those of PUs and MSUs.

MARKET-SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT  

Risk Management  

We are exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We generally do not purchase or hold foreign currency or interest rate or commodity contracts for trading purposes.  

Our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes. As a result, we enter into foreign exchange forward, option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of our existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs, when available and appropriate. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures. We do not hedge our foreign currency translation exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net income. We also utilize certain foreign-currency-denominated debt to mitigate our foreign currency translation exposure from our net investment in foreign operations.  

Our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows. To achieve our objective, we may periodically use interest rate contracts to manage our exposure to interest rate changes.  

Additionally, we enter into certain natural gas futures contracts to reduce the risks associated with natural gas we anticipate using in our manufacturing operations. These amounts are not material to our financial statements.  

In the normal course of operations, we also face other risks that are either 

non-financial or 

non-quantifiable. These risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions, other risks associated with foreign operations, commodity price risk and litigation and compliance risk, which are not reflected in the analyses described below.  

Foreign Exchange 

Value-At-Risk  

We use a 

Value-At-Risk (“VAR”) model to determine the estimated maximum potential 

one-day loss in earnings associated with our foreign exchange positions and contracts. This approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed. VAR model estimates are made assuming normal market conditions. The model includes foreign exchange derivative contracts. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and accounts receivable and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, are excluded from the model.  

The VAR model is a risk analysis tool and does not represent actual losses in fair value that we could incur, nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.  

In both 2020 and 2019, the VAR was estimated using a variance-covariance methodology. The currency correlation was based on 

one-year historical data obtained from one of our domestic banks. A 95% confidence level was used for a 

one-day time horizon.  

The estimated maximum potential 

one-day loss in earnings for our foreign exchange positions and contracts was not significant at 

year-end 2020 or 2019.  

Interest Rate Sensitivity  

In 2020 and 2019, an assumed 18 basis point and 30 basis point, respectively, increase in interest rates affecting our variable-rate borrowings (10% of our weighted average interest rate on floating rate debt) would not have had a significant impact on interest expense.
