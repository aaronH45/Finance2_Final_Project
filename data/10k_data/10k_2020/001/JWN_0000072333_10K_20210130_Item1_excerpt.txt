DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Overview

The Company was founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Washington under the guiding principle that success would come by offering customers the very best service, selection, quality and value. We aspire to be the best fashion retailer in a digitally-connected world by leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, beauty, accessories and home goods for women, men, young adults and children. In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. No matter how customers choose to shop, we are committed to delivering superior service, product and experience, including alterations, order pickup, dining and styling, to make shopping fun, personalized and convenient.

Nordstrom is a leading destination for a breadth of products across brands, styles and prices complemented by unmatched services and experiences. Nordstrom includes the following digital and physical properties:

•Nordstrom.com website and mobile application

•Nordstrom.ca website

•TrunkClub.com website

•94 Nordstrom stores in the U.S.

•six Nordstrom stores and seven Nordstrom Rack stores in Canada

•seven Nordstrom Locals

Nordstrom Rack is a premier off-price destination with an industry-leading off-price digital presence, offering in-demand product and a treasure hunt experience at compelling prices. Nordstrom Rack includes the following digital and physical properties:

•NRHL website and mobile application

•242 Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S.

•two Last Chance clearance stores

Nordstrom Rack purchases merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried at Nordstrom and also serves as an outlet for clearance merchandise from the Nordstrom brand. Currently, NRHL offers both a persistent selection of Nordstrom Rack merchandise, as well as limited-time flash sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands. We are sunsetting the HauteLook brand from a customer perspective, while continuing to offer flash events under the Nordstrom Rack brand. Nordstrom Rack invests in pack and hold inventory, which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our top brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons, to take advantage of favorable buying opportunities. This inventory is typically held for six months on average. 

A key advantage in our business model comes from the way the Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands come together to serve customers. We are unique in the way merchandise can be ordered, fulfilled and delivered between our highly integrated digital and physical presence and our Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack brands. This primarily includes online and traditional in-store shopping, ship-to and pickup from any store of choice for purchases, returns to any location regardless of purchase origin, contactless curbside services and try on at home and pay only for what is kept, among various other personalized services including convenient access to alterations. In addition, we integrated Nordstrom Trunk Club into Nordstrom stores and Nordstrom.com to create a cohesive styling offering and gain efficiencies across Nordstrom.

As our business evolves, our market strategy leverages our inventory to serve customers on their terms through investments in digital capabilities and in people, products and places. Our goal is to gain market share while driving customer engagement and inventory efficiencies. There are two elements to this strategy: first, we aim to provide customers a greater selection of merchandise available for next-day pickup or delivery without increasing inventory levels. Second, we are increasing engagement with customers by offering express services such as order pickup, returns and alterations at additional convenient locations. We accelerated our strategy to ten of our top markets in 2020, including New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Boston, Seattle and Toronto, and to ten additional markets in 2021. These 20 markets encompass approximately 75% of our revenues.

We also receive credit card revenue through our program agreement with TD, whereby TD is the exclusive issuer of our consumer credit cards and we perform account servicing functions. Credit card revenues, net include our portion of the ongoing credit card revenue, net of credit losses, pursuant to our program agreement with TD.

Return Policy

We have a fair and reasonable approach to returns, handling them on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy. Almost all merchandise can be returned by mail or at any store location. We have no formal policy on how long we accept returns at Nordstrom stores or Nordstrom.com. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. Trunk Club allows customers five days from delivery to decide what items they would like to keep or send back for free if the items are in original condition. Trunks can also be returned at any Nordstrom store. Our Nordstrom Rack stores and NRHL generally accept returns of apparel, footwear, accessories and home products up to 45 days from the date of purchase or date of shipment with the original price tag and sales receipt.

Loyalty Program

The Nordy Club is our customer loyalty program that incorporates a traditional point and benefit system, while providing customers exclusive access to products and events, enhanced services, personalized experiences and more convenient ways to shop. Customers accumulate points based on their level of spending and type of participation. Upon reaching certain point thresholds, customers receive Nordstrom Notes, which can be redeemed for goods or services across Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack. The Nordy Club benefits vary based on the level of customer spend, and include Bonus Points days and shopping and fashion events.

We offer customers access to a variety of payment products and services, including a selection of Nordstrom-branded Visa® credit cards in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a Nordstrom-branded private label credit card for Nordstrom purchases. When customers use a Nordstrom-branded credit or debit card, they also participate in The Nordy Club and receive additional benefits, which can vary depending on the level of spend, including early access to the Anniversary Sale, enhanced alteration and stylist benefits and incremental accumulation of points toward Nordstrom Notes. 

Supply Chain Network

Our “Supply Chain Network” consists of: 

•fulfillment centers that primarily process and ship orders to our customers

•distribution centers that primarily process and ship merchandise to our stores and other facilities

•omni-channel centers that both fulfill customer orders and ship merchandise to our stores

We are continually expanding and enhancing our Supply Chain Network facilities and inventory management systems to support our omni-channel capabilities and provide greater access to merchandise selection and faster delivery. We select locations and customize inventory allocations to enable merchandise to flow more efficiently and quickly to our customers. Nordstrom online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom stores, distribution centers or omni-channel centers. Nordstrom in-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but when inventory is unavailable at that store, it may also be shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers, distribution centers, omni-channel centers, or from other Nordstrom stores. Nordstrom Rack online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our fulfillment centers and distribution centers, but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom Rack stores. Both Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack selectively use vendor dropship to supplement online offerings, which are then shipped directly from the vendor to the end customer.

Our first large-scale omni-channel center in Riverside, California, which initially supports our Nordstrom customers in the West Coast region opened in Fall 2020. Nordstrom Rack inventory and fulfillment will be added to this facility in the future. Our smaller Local Omni-channel Hub in Torrance, California was opened in 2019 and supports the greater Los Angeles market as part of our market strategy and will have highly curated inventory that serves the specialized needs of that market. 

EMPLOYEES

Our brand is enabled by our people and built by our customers. Whether serving customers on the sales floor or behind-the-scenes, we strive to attract and retain the best talent in the industry to support our brand – we believe that is only possible when we offer a place where every employee is welcome, respected, appreciated and able to be themselves. We aim to create an exceptional employee experience so that our people can create an exceptional customer experience – something that is a priority for all 58,000 of our employees at every level of the company on a full- or part-time basis in 2020. That number expanded to approximately 62,000 in December 2020 due to the holidays. All of our employees are non-union.

We believe our relationship with our employees is good. We are constantly working to create an environment where employees can build long-term and rewarding careers. As a part of this, we believe in paying employees fairly for the work they do, and we are committed to delivering on equal pay for comparable work, which resulted in achieving 100% pay equity for employees of all genders and races in 2019. Pay equity means that we provide equal pay for comparable work, which we evaluate by analyzing base pay to assess whether employees with similar roles, experience and performance earn equal pay for comparable work. In 2019, we also achieved nearly 100% pay parity, which is our way to measure and report on gender representation at all levels of the company, for men and women, reflecting strong female representation across the Company. We will continue our efforts in this space to build our representation of women of all races at all levels across the organization.

Our people practices across our Company enable us to deliver on our commitment to an inclusive environment where we can all be ourselves, contribute ideas and do our best work. Our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging is an area that has long been a priority, and over the last few years, we have done a lot of listening to understand how we can be a force to help create a more equitable and just world. We amplified our efforts over the past several years, but events in the world around us have accelerated this work. We improved diversity throughout our Company in recent years where women make up 45% of our Board of Directors – nearly 30% of whom are people of color – and 60% of leadership, but we know we have more work to do. To help us track against our progress, we set specific goals to achieve by the end of 2025, including:

•Doubling our charitable giving to nonprofit organizations that promote anti-racism, bringing that total to approximately one million dollars a year

•Delivering five-hundred million dollars in retail sales from brands owned by, operated by or designed by Black and/or Latinx individuals

•Increasing representation of Black and Latinx populations by at least 50% in people-manager roles at the mid and senior levels

We have long believed that we are all made better by the diversity that exists within our Company and our communities and we will continue doing our part to bring about meaningful change.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

As a company, we believe the impacts we have on our employees, customers and communities extend well beyond the walls of our stores. We have an obligation to think beyond a single sale or interaction with a customer to ensure we operate as a responsible company our employees can be proud of. The idea that we have a role to play in building and shaping a positive, inclusive and sustainable future is not new to us, but it has become more important than ever.

We have three pillars that have long been a cornerstone of our work: environmental sustainability, corporate philanthropy and human rights. We set ambitious five-year goals for these pillars leading up to 2020, nearly all of which we met or exceeded by 2019 through living our values each day. Specific highlights include:

•Human Rights: Audited 100% of new Nordstrom Made factories for compliance with our Partnership Guidelines before beginning production

•Charitable Giving: Donated nearly eleven million dollars to 392 organizations located in every community where we do business

•Energy: Exceeded our goal and reduced our energy use per square foot by 20.3%

•Renewable Energy: Exceeded our goal and sourced 97% of our energy from renewable sources in deregulated energy markets and 28% of the energy we used in our operations was renewable energy

•Paper: Exceeded our goal and consumed less than 2 million tons of paper per one million dollars in sales

•Water: Exceeded our goal and reduced water use per square foot by 14%

We know we have further to go – we can and must do more and we are continually pushing ourselves to be a better company. We are taking a more aggressive stance to make meaningful progress on our three pillars, which includes new goals set around: 

•Climate change, circularity and environmental impact of product and services

•Ethical working practices and women’s empowerment

•Customer engagement, cause marketing, corporate grant making and employee engagement

TRADEMARKS

Our most notable trademarks include Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, HauteLook, Trunk Club, Zella, Halogen, BP., Caslon, Treasure & Bond, Tucker+Tate and 1901. Each of our trademarks is renewable indefinitely, provided it is still used in commerce at the time of the renewal.

SEASONALITY

Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations and cyclical trends in consumer spending. Our sales are typically higher in our second quarter, which historically included the Anniversary Sale, and the holidays in the fourth quarter. As a result of COVID-19, the Anniversary Sale was moved to August in 2020, which fell entirely in our third fiscal quarter. Results for any one quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to the Anniversary Sale, and we purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through December). Consistent with our seasonal fluctuations, our working capital requirements have historically increased during the months leading up to the Anniversary Sale and the holidays as we purchase inventory in anticipation of increased sales.
