ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

​

Financial Risk Management

​

We manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of our commercial paper program, variable and fixed rate debt, and interest rate swaps. Our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. To do this, we use the following guidelines: (i) use average daily outstanding borrowings to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure, (ii) limit the average annual amount subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total amount that represents 25% of the carrying value of our debt portfolio or less, (iii) include no leveraged products, and (iv) hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark-to-market status.

​

When we use derivative financial instruments, it is primarily to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure, fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure. The interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets. As of January 30, 2021, we had no forward-starting interest rate swap agreements outstanding. 

​

Annually, we review with the Financial Policy Committee of our Board of Directors compliance with the guidelines described above. The guidelines may change as our business needs dictate.

​

The tables below provide information about our underlying debt portfolio as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. The amounts shown for each year represent the contractual maturities of long-term debt, excluding finance leases, as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. Interest rates reflect the weighted average rate for the outstanding instruments. The variable rate debt is based on U.S. dollar LIBOR using the forward yield curve as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. The Fair Value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments as of January 30, 2021 and February 1, 2020. We have no outstanding interest rate derivatives classified as fair value hedges as of January 30, 2021 or February 1, 2020. See Notes 6, 7 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Based on our year-end 2020 variable rate debt levels, a 10 percent change in interest rates would be immaterial. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of derivatives and hedging policies.
