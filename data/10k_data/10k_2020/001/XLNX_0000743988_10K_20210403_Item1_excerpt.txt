Industry Overview 

Several silicon architectures including microprocessors, graphics processing units (GPUs), application specific standard products (ASSPs), and custom application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are used for compute in most digital electronic systems today. Central processing units (CPUs) historically have been the most common platform used by software developers but have limitations when used for modern compute tasks ranging from real-time control to machine learning. Fixed function acceleration and heterogeneous systems ranging from GPUs, ASSPs, and custom ASICs meet some of these compute demands but with a limited range of flexibility.

Xilinx develops adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies - from the endpoint to the edge to the cloud. Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA, hardware programmable SoCs and the ACAP, all designed to deliver the most dynamic processor technology for adaptable systems. In particular, the ACAP draws on the strengths of CPUs, FPGAs, and fixed function accelerators to accelerate any workload with ease-of-use for software and hardware developers alike. 

Other advantages of Xilinx adaptable platforms include:

•Faster time-to-market and increased design flexibility. Both advantages are enabled by Xilinx development tools which allow users to implement and revise their designs quickly. In contrast, ASICs and ASSPs require significant development time and offer limited, if any, flexibility to make design changes. 

•Xilinx adaptable platforms are standard components. This means that the same device can be sold to many different users for a myriad of applications. In sharp contrast, ASICs and ASSPs are customized for an individual user or a specific application. 

Hardware adaptable platforms are generally disadvantaged in terms of relative device size when compared to devices that are designed to perform a fixed function in a single or small set of applications. ASICs and ASSPs tend to be smaller than FPGAs, hardware programmable SoCs, and ACAPs performing the same fixed function, resulting in a lower unit cost. 

However, there is a high fixed cost associated with ASIC and ASSP development that is not applicable to customers of hardware programmable ICs. This fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development significantly increases for every next generation technology node. From a total cost of development perspective, ASICs and ASSPs have generally been more cost effective when used in high-volume production, and hardware programmable platforms have generally been more cost effective when used in low- to mid-volume production. However, we expect hardware adaptable platforms to be able to address higher volume applications and gain market share from ASIC and ASSP suppliers as the fixed cost of ASIC and ASSP development increases on next generation technology nodes.

An overview of PLD and market applications for our products is shown in the following table:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Strategy and Competition

Our strategy for growth is to displace ASICs, ASSPs and traditional PLDs in next generation electronic systems. Additionally, we focus on enabling “building the adaptable intelligent world" with an emphasis on the three major elements described below. 

•Data center first: Xilinx is ramping up its efforts with key data center customers, ecosystem partners and software application developers, to further enable innovation and deployments in compute acceleration, computational storage and network acceleration.

•Accelerated growth in core markets: core markets consist of automotive; wireless infrastructure; wired communications; audio, video and broadcast; aerospace and defense; industrial, scientific and medical; test, measurement and emulation; and consumer technologies where the Company has leadership technology and substantial market traction. These core markets and customers are central to Xilinx, and Xilinx continues to drive and enable innovation in these areas.

•Drive adaptive computing with the introduction of ACAP: in March 2018, we announced ACAP, which we believe is a breakthrough product category. ACAP is a highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform that can be programmed at the hardware level to adapt to the needs of a wide range of applications and workloads. An ACAP's adaptability, which can be done dynamically in milliseconds during operation, delivers levels of performance and performance per-watt that is unmatched by CPUs or GPUs. 

The costs and risks associated with application-specific devices can only be justified for high-volume or highly-specialized commodity products. Programmable platforms, alternatively, are becoming critical for our customers to meet increasingly stringent product requirements – cost, power, performance and density – in a business environment characterized by increased complexity, shrinking market windows, rapidly changing market demands, capped engineering budgets, escalating ASIC and ASSP engineering costs and increased economic and development risk.

5
With every new generation of our products, our strategy is to increase the performance, density and system-level functionality and integration, while driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node. This enables us to provide simpler, smarter programmable platforms and design methodologies allowing our customers to focus on innovation and differentiation of their products. Our strategy includes expanding our user base by making our platforms more accessible to users who don’t have prior experience with hardware programmable devices.

Our products now compete in several areas of the semiconductor industry that are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change, increasing levels of integration, product obsolescence and continuous price erosion. We expect continued competition from our primary PLD competitors such as Intel Corporation (Intel), Lattice Semiconductor Corporation (Lattice) and Microsemi Corporation (Microsemi, acquired by Microchip), and from ASSP vendors such as Broadcom Corporation (Broadcom), Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. (Marvell), Analog Devices and Texas Instruments Incorporated (Texas Instruments), as well as from companies such as NVIDIA with whom we historically have not competed. In addition, we expect continued competition from the ASIC market, which has been ongoing since the inception of FPGAs. Other competitors include manufacturers of:

•high-density programmable logic products characterized by FPGA-type architectures;

•high-volume and low-cost FPGAs as programmable replacements for ASICs and ASSPs;

•ASICs and ASSPs with incremental amounts of embedded programmable logic; 

•high-speed, low-density complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs);

•high-performance digital signal processing (DSP) devices;

•products with embedded processors;

•products with embedded multi-gigabit transceivers;

•discrete general-purpose GPUs targeting data center and automotive applications; and

•other new or emerging programmable logic products.

We believe that important competitive factors in the logic IC industry include:

•product pricing;

•time-to-market;

•product performance, reliability, quality, power consumption and density;

•field upgradability;

•adaptability of products to specific applications;

•ease of use and functionality of software design tools;

•availability and functionality of predefined IP; 

•completeness of applicable software solutions;

•adherence to industry-standard programming environments;

•inventory and supply chain management;

•access to leading-edge process technology and assembly capacity; 

•ability to provide timely customer service and support; and

•access to advanced packaging technology.

Finally, we offer a range of configuration products including one-time programmable and in-system programmable storage devices to configure our FPGAs. These programmable read-only memory (PROM) products support all our FPGA devices.

Third-Party Alliances

We and certain third parties have developed and continue to offer a robust ecosystem of IP, boards, tools, services and support through our alliance program. We also work with these third parties to promote our programmable platforms through third-party tools, IP, software, boards and design services.

In May 2016, we led the formation of the very broad Cache Coherent Interconnect Acceleration (CCIX) consortium with the singular goal of bringing a high-performance, open acceleration framework to the data center market. As of March 2021, this consortium had approximately 40 members, ranging from silicon providers to a rich ecosystem of partners including design, foundry, verification, software and system vendors.

Engineering Services

Our engineering services provide customers with engineering resources to augment their design teams and to provide expert design-specific advice. We tailor our engineering services to the needs of its customers, ranging from hands-on training to full design creation and implementation.

Research and Development

Our research and development (R&D) activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ICs and the development of products, containing design automation tools for hardware, embedded software, optimized software tools and libraries that extend the reach of our platforms to software developers, the design of logic IP, the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions, performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering PLD power consumption. We are also actively contributing to numerous industry open source software initiatives across a broad range of technologies.

11
As a result of our R&D efforts, we have introduced a number of new products during the past several years including the Virtex and Kintex UltraScale and UltraScale+, Zynq UltraScale+MPSoC, Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoCs, Alveo board and Versal ACAP families. We have enhanced our IP core offerings and software design suite (Vivado) as well as introduced our unified software platform (Vitis). Through process technology collaboration with our foundry suppliers along with strategic investment in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools and improved design techniques, we were the first PLD company to ship 45nm, 28nm, 20nm and 16nm FPGA devices in high volume. Additionally, our investments in R&D have allowed us to ship the first adaptable 28nm, 16nm and 7nm devices with embedded ARM technology, the industry's first All Programmable SoC with integrated RF Data Converters, as well as the industry's first 3D Stacked Silicon Interconnect Technology IC devices on the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm process nodes.

The COVID-19 pandemic did not have any significant impact on our R&D activities and efforts in fiscal 2021. Although almost all of our employees have been working remotely since March 16, 2020, we have long had a business continuity plan and invested in technologies and tools that would support our employees in effectively working remotely. We believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success, and we will continue to invest in our technology. 

Sales and Distribution

We sell our products to OEMs, EMS and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to OEMs and EMS. We are also developing a network of Value Added Resellers (VARs) and Integrated Solution Vendors (ISVs) for our Alveo products. We characterize distributors, VARs and ISVs as our distribution channel.

We use a dedicated global sales and marketing organization, and to a lesser extent, independent sales representatives, to generate sales. In general, we focus our direct demand creation efforts on key accounts. Our distribution channel and independent sales representatives create demand within the balance of our customer base in defined territories or for markets aligned with their focus. The distributor channel also provides inventory, value-added services and logistics for a wide range of OEM or end customers.

As discussed under the caption "We are subject to regulatory and operational risks associated with conducting business operations outside of the U.S. which could adversely affect our business." in Item 1A "Risk Factors," how, where and to whom we sell our products is affected by an evolving regulatory environment, among other factors. Even when specific regulatory changes – such as the April 2020 announcement by the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) of the U.S. Department of Commerce of the elimination of the license exception CIV (civil end-users), which had permitted certain national security-controlled items to be exported to certain destinations, such as China, without a license, and the expansion of controls over items for military end-uses in China, Russia and Venezuela – are not ultimately expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and/or operating results, they nonetheless require substantial management and operational resources in order to maintain compliance. 

Whether Xilinx, the distributor, or the independent sales representative identifies the sales opportunity, a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders. In such situations, distributors are the sellers of the products and as such they bear most legal and financial risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods, including such risks as credit loss, inventory shrinkage, theft and foreign currency fluctuations, but excluding certain indemnity and warranty liabilities.

In accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice, we have granted our authorized distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a change in list prices subsequent to the initial sale. Revenues from sales to our distributors and non-distributors are recognized upon the transfer of control, which typically occurs at shipment.

Avnet, Inc. (Avnet) distributes our products worldwide. Avnet's revenue accounted for 43%, 42% and 45% of our worldwide net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of April 3, 2021 and March 28, 2020, Avnet accounted for 13% and 31%, respectively, of our total net accounts receivable. We expect our accounts receivable to fluctuate as we partner with our distributors to manage their inventory requirements. We also use other regional distributors throughout the world. We believe distributors provide a cost-effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services. Since PLDs are standard products, they do not carry many of the inventory risks posed by ASICs. From time to time, we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies, or move customers to a direct support or fulfillment model as we deem appropriate given our strategies, the level of distributor business activity and distributor performance and financial condition. See "Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Concentrations of Risk" to our consolidated financial statements, included in Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data," for information about concentrations of credit risk and "Note 15. Segment Information" for information about our revenues from external customers and domestic and international operations.

12
No other distributor or end customer accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in fiscal 2021, 2020 or 2019.

As most of our employees, and those of our customers, are currently working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience some delays in processing orders and deliveries in fiscal 2022 for the duration of the pandemic.

Backlog 

As of April 3, 2021, our backlog from OEM customers and backlog from end customers reported by our distributors scheduled for delivery within the next three months was $645.0 million, compared to $503.0 million as of March 28, 2020. Orders from end customers to our distributors are subject to changes in delivery schedules or to cancellation without significant penalty. As a result, backlog from both OEM customers and end customers reported by our distributors as of any particular period may not be a reliable indicator of revenue for any future period.

Wafer Fabrication

As a fabless semiconductor company, we do not manufacture wafers used for our IC products or PROMs. Rather, we purchase our wafers from independent foundries including TSMC, United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung). TSMC manufactures the wafers for our Advanced Products. 

Precise terms with respect to the volume and timing of wafer production and the pricing of wafers produced by the semiconductor foundries are determined by periodic negotiations with each wafer foundry. 

Our strategy is to focus our resources on market development and creating new ICs, board products and supporting software ecosystem rather than on wafer fabrication. We continuously evaluate opportunities to enhance foundry relationships and/or obtain additional capacity from our main suppliers as well as other suppliers of wafers manufactured with leading-edge process technologies, and we adjust loadings at particular foundries to meet our business needs.

While we did not experience any manufacturing or supply disruption in fiscal 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the pandemic's impact on the timing and overall demand from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply may adversely impact our business and financial results. 

Sort, Assembly and Test

Wafers are sorted by the foundry or independent sort subcontractors. Sorted die are assembled by subcontractors. During the assembly process, the wafers are separated into individual die, which are then assembled into various package types. Following assembly, the packaged units are generally tested by independent test subcontractors or by Xilinx personnel. We purchase most of our assembly services from Siliconware Precision Industries Ltd. and most of our test services from King Yuan Electronics Company in Taiwan.

Generally, the COVID-19 pandemic and related business closures have not disrupted our sorting, testing and packaging activities to date. However, if the pandemic is not contained and its social, economic and business impact broadens, we may experience delay in deliveries by business partners and, as a result, a material adverse impact on our operations and financial conditions.

Quality Certification

Xilinx has achieved and currently maintains quality management system certification to ISO9001 for our facilities in San Jose, California; Longmont, Colorado; Singapore; and Hyderabad, India. In addition, Xilinx achieved and currently maintains ISO 14001 and ISO45001 environmental health and safety management system certifications in the San Jose and Singapore locations.

Intellectual Property and Licenses

13
While our various intellectual property rights (including patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and trademarks) are important to our success, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses. As of April 3, 2021, we held over 5,300 issued patents, which vary in duration, and over 1,300 pending patent applications relating to our technology in various jurisdictions around the world. We maintain an active patent filing program in the areas of, but not limited to, circuits, software, applications, system and platform architecture, IP cores, testing methodologies, semiconductor manufacturing and other technologies relating to our products and business. We have licensed portions of our patent portfolio to certain external parties and have obtained patent licenses from certain external parties as well. 

We have acquired various licenses from external parties to certain technologies that are implemented in our products, including our IP cores and devices. These licenses support our continuing ability to make and sell our products. We have also acquired licenses to certain proprietary software, open-source software, and related technologies, such as compilers, for our design tools. Continued use of such software and technology is important to the operation of the design tools upon which our customers depend.

Xilinx, the Xilinx logo, Alveo, Artix, CoolRunner, ISE, Kintex, Spartan, Versal, Virtex, Vitis, Vivado and Zynq are trademarks of Xilinx in the United States and/or other countries. Maintaining these trademarks, and the goodwill associated with them, is important to our business. We have also obtained the rights to use certain trademarks owned by consortiums and other trademark owners that are related to our products and business.

We intend to continue to protect our intellectual property vigorously. We believe that failure to enforce our intellectual property rights or failure to protect our trade secrets effectively could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We incurred, and in the future we may continue to incur, litigation expenses to defend against claims of infringement and to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties. However, any such litigation may or may not be successful.

Corporate Responsibility

Xilinx places a high level of importance on corporate responsibility. Through senior-level sponsorship, regular environmental, health and safety assessments and company-wide performance targets, we strive to achieve a culture that emphasizes contribution to local and global communities through a number of key initiatives:

Company

We strive to meet or exceed industry and regulatory standards for ethical business practices, product responsibility, and supplier management. All of Xilinx's directors, officers and employees are required to comply not only with the letter of the laws, rules and regulations that govern the conduct of our business, but also with the spirit of those laws.

Environment

We continually monitor regulatory requirement and resource trends in order to identify, manage and control activities that have an environmental impact. We focus on the conservation of energy and natural resources, reducing the solid and chemical waste of our operations, avoiding and preventing pollution and minimizing our overall environmental impact with regards to the communities around us and consistent with global climate change efforts.

Community

We are committed to growing strategic relationships with a wide range of local organizations and programs that are designed to develop and strengthen communities located around the world. Xilinx develops local community relationships at key sites through funding and involvement that encourages active participation, teamwork, and volunteerism. Xilinx supports opportunities initiated by its employees and that involve participation and empowerment of its employees. We are committed to charitable giving programs that work towards systemic change and measurable results.

Workplace

We provide a safe and healthy work environment for all employees. The Xilinx Code of Social Responsibility outlines standards to ensure that working conditions at Xilinx are safe and that workers are treated with respect, fairness and dignity.

To support the health and well-being of our employees, customers, partners and communities from the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all of our employees have been working remotely since mid-March 2020. We have long had a business continuity plan in place for unforeseeable situations and, over the years, have invested in technology that would provide our employees the flexibility and security to work effectively and remotely in case of business disruptions. 

Government Regulations

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to international operations, export controls, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, employee health and safety, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.

Human Capital

Our employees are our greatest assets and we are dedicated to providing a healthy and safe work environment that promotes respect, dignity, equality and inclusion. As of April 3, 2021, we had 4,890 employees in our global workforce. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we have not experienced any work stoppages. 

As a response to the spread of COVID-19 and local government requirements, we implemented global health and safety protocols to keep our workforce safe. We closed most of our offices around the world in March 2020 for all except essential workers. We eliminated business travel and provided our employees with curated information, enhanced wellness programs, and technical resources to work remotely. These measures helped Xilinx maintain operations with our regular employees and contingent workforce.

Attraction & Recruitment

The demand for hardware and software engineers, including those specializing in AI and machine learning, is very competitive. We leverage our intern and Entry Level Professional recruiting programs to ensure we acquire the needed talent. We also partner with higher education institutions globally to develop our candidate pipelines, recruit at industry conferences and actively promote and adjust our employee referral program to target hard-to-fill positions. 

Additionally, we collaborate with community groups like the Society of Women Engineers, Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers and the National Society of Black Engineers to improve our reach and attract minority candidates. Through our Women in Technology employee resource group in India, we offer returnship programs designed to assist women professionals who would like to restart or rebuild their career in technology.

Development & Retention

We are committed to a culture that enables employees to perform at their best, realize their professional potential and be well, both physically and mentally. We benchmark our compensation and benefits annually to ensure we remain competitive and offer stock awards and an employee stock purchase plan to retain employees and align their interests with those of our stockholders.

We develop our employees year-round leveraging methods such as live training, personalized on-demand learning resources, coaching, courses and conferences. Additionally, we offer education reimbursement to help support future career growth.

We value diverse perspectives and actively listen to employees through numerous channels throughout the year. In addition to engagement surveys, we use a number of creative channels to facilitate dialogue including anonymous online inquiry tools during company-wide business meetings, executive skip level meetings and regular “Ask Me Anything” meetings where employees can personally raise any question to our executives.

15
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

We believe inclusivity is essential to fostering a culture of innovation and creativity that can change the world. To that end, we are committed to providing an inclusive and equitable workplace for all employees and candidates, regardless of gender, gender identity, veteran status, race, ethnicity or ability. We design Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) programs to create an environment where everyone feels a deep sense of belonging and connection. We are committed to treating all employees around the world with respect and compassion. 

We have increased our efforts to recruit, develop and retain a more diverse workforce with a focus on those historically underrepresented in the technology field, including women, Black and Hispanic candidates and are committed to ensuring diverse candidate representation in interviews. 

We integrate DEI into our programs and processes and require unconscious bias training for all new hires. Employees are encouraged to view special guest DEI speaker presentations and join employee resource groups to provide support and promote inclusion.
