Business Segments

Commencing with the second quarter of 2021, the Company operates its business in four reportable segments: U.S. Pharmaceutical, International, Medical-Surgical Solutions, and Prescription Technology Solutions (“RxTS”). The Company’s equity method investment in Change Healthcare LLC (“Change Healthcare JV”), which was split-off from McKesson in the fourth quarter of 2020, has been included in Other for retrospective periods presented.

Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment distributes branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar and over-the-counter (“OTC”) pharmaceutical drugs, and other healthcare-related products. This segment provides practice management, technology, clinical support, and business solutions to community-based oncology and other specialty practices. In addition, the segment sells financial, operational, and clinical solutions to pharmacies (retail, hospital, alternate site) and provides consulting, outsourcing, technological, and other services.

Our International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in 13 European countries and Canada where we own, partner or franchise with retail pharmacies, and support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions.

Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, and home health care agencies. We offer more than 275,000 national brand medical-surgical products as well as McKesson’s own line of high-quality products through a network of distribution centers within the United States (“U.S.”).

Our RxTS segment brings together CoverMyMeds, RelayHealth, RxCrossroads, and McKesson Prescription Automation, including Multi-Client Central Fill as a Service, to serve our biopharma and life sciences partners and patients. Together, we work across the healthcare delivery system to connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma for next-generation patient access and adherence solutions that help people get the medicine they need to live healthier lives.

U.S. Pharmaceutical Segment:

Our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment provides distribution and logistics services for branded, generic, specialty, biosimilar, and OTC pharmaceutical drugs along with other healthcare-related products to customers. This business provides solutions and services to pharmacies, hospitals and other providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, payers, and patients throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

McKESSON CORPORATION

This segment includes our Ontada business, providing software to support the clinical, financial, and operational needs of our oncology practice partners. Ontada also partners with oncology providers and biopharma partners to perform real-world evidence studies, retrospective research, and to provide clinical data insights, advisory solutions and education opportunities.

This segment also offers solutions which enable its customers to drive greater efficiencies in their day to day operations, effectively managing their inventories and complying with complex government regulations. Solutions include McKesson Pharmacy Systems, MacroHelix and Supply Logix, all of which provide innovative software technology and services that support retail pharmacies and hospitals.

When we discuss specialty products or services, we consider the following factors: diseases requiring complex treatment regimens such as cancer and rheumatoid arthritis; plasma and biologics products; ongoing clinical monitoring requirements, high-cost, special handling, storage, and delivery requirements and, in some cases, exclusive distribution arrangements. Our use of the term “specialty” may not be comparable to that used by other industry participants, including our competitors.

International Segment:

Our International segment provides distribution and services to wholesale, institutional, and retail customers in 13 European countries where we own, partner, or franchise with retail pharmacies and operate through two businesses: Pharmaceutical Distribution and Retail Pharmacy. Our operations in Canada, including Rexall retail pharmacies, support better, safer patient care by delivering vital medicines, supplies, and information technology solutions throughout Canada.

Our European Pharmaceutical Distribution business delivers pharmaceutical and other healthcare-related products to pharmacies across Europe. This business functions as a vital link, using technology-enabled management systems at our regional wholesale branches to connect manufacturers to retail pharmacies, supplying medicines and other products sold in pharmacies. 

Our European Retail Pharmacy business serves patients and consumers in European countries directly through approximately 2,100 of our own pharmacies and 5,500 participant pharmacies operating under brand partnership arrangements. In addition, this business includes outpatient dispensing, eCommerce and homecare arrangements mainly in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and provides traditional prescription pharmaceuticals, non-prescription products and medical services, and operates under the Lloyds pharmacy branding in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, and the U.K. In addition, we partner with independent pharmacies under local banner programs. 

McKesson Canada is one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesale and retail distributors in Canada. The wholesale business delivers products to retail pharmacies, hospitals, long-term care centers, clinics and institutions in Canada through a national network of distribution centers and provides logistics and distribution services for manufacturers. 

Beyond wholesale pharmaceutical logistics and distribution, McKesson Canada provides automation and technology solutions to its retail and hospital customers. Additionally, McKesson Canada provides comprehensive specialty health services to Canadians, including a national network of specialty pharmacies, personalized patient care and support programs, and INVIVA, Canada’s first and largest accredited network of private infusion clinics.

The Canada retail business includes over 2,500 banner pharmacies under the IDA, Guardian, The Medicine Shoppe, Remedy’sRx, Proxim, and Uniprix banners, and more than 400 owned pharmacies under the Rexall brand where we provide patients with greater choice and access, integrated pharmacy care and industry-leading service levels.

Medical-Surgical Solutions Segment:

Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment delivers medical-supply distribution, logistics, biomedical maintenance, and other services to healthcare providers across the alternate-site spectrum. Our more than 250,000 customers include physician offices, surgery centers, post-acute care facilities, hospital reference labs, and home health agencies. We distribute medical-surgical supplies (such as gloves, needles, syringes and wound care products), infusion pumps, laboratory equipment and pharmaceuticals. Through a network of distribution centers within the U.S., we offer more than 275,000 products from national brand manufacturers and McKesson’s own high-quality product line. Through the right mix of products and services, we help improve efficiencies, profitability and compliance. We also never lose focus on helping customers improve patient and business outcomes. We develop customized plans to address the product, operational, and clinical support needs of our customers, including tackling inventory management, reducing administrative burdens, and training and educating clinical staff. We deliver for our customers, so they can deliver and care for their patients. Additionally, under a contract with the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), McKesson’s Medical-Surgical business leverages its expertise to manage the assembly of supply kits needed to administer COVID-19 vaccines, as well as some of the sourcing of those supplies. The kits are being produced and distributed at the direction of HHS to support the administration of all vaccines approved in the U.S. 

Prescription Technology Solutions Segment:

Our Prescription Technology Solutions segment works across the healthcare delivery system to connect pharmacies, providers, payers, and biopharma for next generation patient access and adherence solutions and operates primarily through the following businesses:

•CoverMyMeds – Provides solutions to help patients get the medications they need to live healthy lives by seamlessly connecting the healthcare network to improve medication access; thereby increasing speed to therapy and reducing prescription abandonment. By facilitating appropriate access to medications, the company can help its customers avoid millions of dollars each year in administrative waste and avoidable medical spending caused by prescription abandonment. 

•RelayHealth Pharmacy Solutions – Provides workflow solutions to connect key healthcare stakeholders with more than 50,000 U.S. retail pharmacies and processes more than 18 billion pharmacy transactions annually.

Other:

Change Healthcare: Our equity ownership interest in Change Healthcare JV, a joint venture, has been accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Change Healthcare JV provided software and analytics, network solutions, and technology-enabled services that deliver wide-ranging financial, operational, and clinical benefits to payers, providers and consumers. On March 10, 2020, we completed the separation of our interest in the Change Healthcare JV through a split-off transaction. This transaction reduced our investment in the Change Healthcare JV to zero. Refer to Financial Note 2, “Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to this transaction.

Restructuring, Business Combinations, Investments, and Divestitures 

We have undertaken additional strategic initiatives in recent years designed to further focus on our core healthcare businesses and enhance our competitive position. These initiatives are detailed in Financial Notes 2, 3, 4, and 5, “Investment in Change Healthcare Joint Venture,” “Held for Sale,” “Restructuring, Impairment, and Related Charges,” and “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition

We face highly competitive global environments. Additionally, in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation. In the pharmaceutical distribution environment in which our U.S. Pharmaceutical and International segments operate, we face strong competition from international, national, regional and local full-line, short-line and specialty distributors, service merchandisers, self-warehousing chain drug stores, manufacturers engaged in direct distribution, third-party logistics companies, and large payer organizations. Our retail businesses, which primarily operate in our International segment, face competition from various global, national, regional, and local global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies. We consider our largest competitors in distribution, wholesaling, and logistics to be AmerisourceBergen Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc.

Our Medical-Surgical Solutions segment provides medical-surgical supply distribution, logistics, and other services to healthcare providers, including physician offices, surgery centers, nursing homes, hospital reference labs, home health care agencies, and alternative health sites with competition from a wide range of national and regional medical supply and equipment distributors throughout the U.S.

Our RxTS business experiences substantial competition from many companies, including other software services firms, consulting firms, shared service vendors, and internet-based companies with technology applicable to the healthcare industry. Competition in this business varies in size from large to small companies, in geographical coverage, and in scope and breadth of products and services offered. 

In addition, we compete with other service providers, pharmaceutical and other healthcare manufacturers, as well as other potential customers of our businesses, which may from time to time decide to develop, for their own internal needs, supply management capabilities that might otherwise be provided by our businesses. We believe that our scale and diversity of product and service offerings are our primary competitive advantages. In all areas, key competitive factors include price, quality of service, breadth of product lines, innovation and, in some cases, convenience to the customer. 

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, and Licenses

McKesson and its subsidiaries hold patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets related to McKesson products and services. We pursue patent protection for our innovations and obtain copyright protection for our original works of authorship, when such protection is advantageous. Through these efforts, we have developed a portfolio of patents and copyrights in the U.S. and worldwide. In addition, we have registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in foreign countries.

We believe that, in the aggregate, McKesson’s confidential information, patents, copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual property licenses are important to its operations and market position, but we do not consider any of our businesses to be dependent upon any one patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret, or any family or families of the same. We cannot guarantee that our intellectual property portfolio will be sufficient to deter misappropriation, theft, or misuse of our technology, nor that we can successfully enjoin infringers. We periodically receive notices alleging that our products or services infringe on third party patents and other intellectual property rights. These claims may result in McKesson entering settlement agreements, paying damages, discontinuing use or sale of accused products, or ceasing other activities. While the outcome of any litigation or dispute is inherently uncertain, we do not believe that the resolution of any of these infringement notices would have a material adverse impact on our results of operation.

McKESSON CORPORATION

We hold inbound licenses for certain intellectual property that is used internally, and in some cases, utilized in McKesson’s products or services. While it may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services, we believe, based upon past experience and industry practice, such licenses generally can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. We believe our operations and products and services are not materially dependent on any single license or other agreement with any third party.

Human Capital 

Our vision for a healthier world begins with our employees, who strive to bring our mission to life every day. As a company, we deliver programs that focus on improving employee health and wellness, creating opportunities for growth and development, and providing an inclusive workplace where our employees can reach their full potential. At March 31, 2021, we had approximately 76,000 employees worldwide, including 17,000 part-time employees and 32,000 employees in the U.S.

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”): At McKesson, we are committed to making DEI integral to everything we do, because we believe building a healthier future is everyone’s business. We build successful teams by recruiting, developing, and retaining diverse talent and we recognize our culture of inclusion as an important element that drives long-term shareholder value. During 2021, we appointed the newly created role of chief impact officer, who will drive our strategy and execution related to DEI as well as sustainability, environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”), and philanthropy. 

At March 31, 2021, women and people of color represented the following:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The data for our metrics is derived from our voluntary, self-identification process as of March 31, 2021 and therefore represents our best estimate at this time. 

(2)Represents our leadership at the vice president level and above.

(3)Represents worldwide employees.

(4)Represents U.S. employees only as the data for Canada and Europe is not available.

(5)People of Color includes the following races and ethnicities: Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Two or More Races.

Culture and Leadership: What sets McKesson apart as an exceptional place is our people. Our employees understand that together, unified by our global I2CARE and ILEAD principles, we fulfill our mission of improving care in every setting. Our I2CARE values (Integrity, Inclusion, Customer-First, Accountability, Respect, Excellence) are foundational to all that we do, and who we are as a company. ILEAD (Inspire, Leverage, Execute, Advance, Develop) is our common definition and shared commitment to leadership. By embracing this commitment, we bring out the best in ourselves and position McKesson to continue to drive better health – for our company, our customers, and the patients they serve for years to come. We promote leadership behaviors through culture initiatives that offer practical tips on how to debate, decide, and commit, be open and candid, and maintain an enterprise-first mindset when navigating conversations affecting operations within and across our business segments. These values and behaviors help make McKesson unique.

McKESSON CORPORATION

Investment in Employees: To support employee growth, we provide regular feedback and training, and work to create and maintain inclusive work settings where everyone can bring their authentic self to work and feel welcomed and appreciated, and where their perspectives are sought out, heard, and considered. Through training, we encourage leaders to embrace diverse perspectives and lead inclusively. Employee development programs include training, coaching, and 360-degree assessments, which can support the careers of future leaders and their teams. We offer financial assistance programs for higher education opportunities that support employees’ career growth at the company. To provide compensation that is focused on attracting and retaining talent with the skills and experience necessary for a specific role, our compensation program is built on a set of quantifiable factors defined by our guiding principles of internal fairness, market competitiveness, and pay for performance. We operate in several countries and our benefits offerings vary accordingly. We offer health and wellness benefits to advance the physical, mental, and social well-being of our people, savings programs to help prepare them for retirement, and flexible work arrangements, among other benefits offerings, when possible. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we offered extended medical benefits covering COVID-19 related visits, treatment and testing, expanded telehealth options, emergency paid time off (“PTO”), and a platform for employees to donate their regular PTO to co-workers who were more impacted by COVID-19. We also seek employee feedback through an annual employee opinion survey, which assesses our employees’ levels of engagement, commitment, and overall satisfaction using industry benchmarks, and we then design action plans to improve those metrics.

Health and Safety: Our security and safety departments employ systems designed to continually monitor our facilities and work environment to help identify and prevent or mitigate any potential risks. This includes having procedures in place and investing in equipment for both physical and electronic security. We routinely assess facilities to monitor closely adherence to established security and safety standards. If we identify a vulnerability, it is documented, and the facility prepares an action plan. Our employees receive specialized training related to their role, work setting, and equipment used in their work environment. As our processes evolve, we update relevant safety training modules, which may include new employee training programs. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, our priority has been, and continues to be, protecting the health and safety of our employees. The various responses we put in place to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our business operations, including telecommuting and work-from-home policies, restricted travel, and enhanced safety measures, are intended to limit employee exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 as they perform their jobs while also providing employee support programs and a sense of belonging. For additional information on our response to COVID-19 in the workplace, refer to the COVID-19 section of “Trends and Uncertainties” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Government Regulation

McKesson, generally and in many of the highly regulated industries in which it operates, is subject to oversight by various federal, state, and local governmental entities. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, and guidance promulgated by those entities could have a material adverse impact to the Company’s business operations, reputation, results of operations, and financial position.

Controlled Substances: We are subject to the operating and security standards of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments, HHS, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), and other comparable agencies. We have received monetary penalties and/or licensing sanctions pursuant to these requirements and future allegations of noncompliance could result in an inability to obtain, maintain or renew permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals needed for the operation of our businesses.

10
McKESSON CORPORATION

Additionally, the Company is a defendant in approximately 3,200 cases alleging claims related to the distribution of controlled substances (opioids), as described in Financial Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The plaintiffs in those cases include governmental entities (such as states, provinces, counties and municipalities) as well as businesses, groups and individuals. As a result of ongoing, advanced discussions with state attorneys general and plaintiffs’ representatives regarding a framework to resolve the claims of governmental entities, and our assessment of certain other opioid-related claims, we have reached a stage at which a broad settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities is probable and recorded a charge of $8.1 billion for the year ended March 31, 2021 within “Claims and litigation charges, net” in our Consolidated Statement of Operations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Because of the many uncertainties associated with any potential settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioid-related litigation, including the uncertainty of the scope of participation by plaintiffs in any potential settlement, we are not able to reasonably estimate the upper or lower ends of the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters. The adverse outcome of legal proceedings might also involve significant expense, management time and distraction, and risk of loss that can be difficult to predict or quantify. In addition to this litigation, legislative or regulatory measures related to the distribution of controlled substances such as prescription opioids could affect our business in ways that we may not be able to predict. For example, some states have passed legislation that could require us to pay taxes or assessments on the distribution of opioid medications in those states and other states have considered similar legislation. 

Government Contracts: Our contracts with government entities are subject to unique compliance risks and typically are subject to procurement laws that include socio-economic, employment practices, environmental protection, recordkeeping and accounting, and other requirements. We are subject to government audits, investigations and oversight proceedings. Government agencies routinely review and audit government contractors to determine whether they are complying with contractual and legal requirements. If we fail to comply with these requirements, or we fail an audit, we may be subject to various sanctions such as monetary damages, criminal and civil penalties, termination of contracts and suspension or debarment from government contract work. These requirements complicate our business and increase our compliance burden and material non-compliance could harm our reputation.

Local, state, and federal governments continue to strengthen their position and scrutiny over practices involving or allegedly involving fraud, waste, and abuse affecting Medicare, Medicaid, other government healthcare programs, and government contracts. Our relationships with pharmaceutical and medical surgical product manufacturers and healthcare providers, as well as our provision of products and services to government entities, subject our business to laws, regulation, and government guidance on fraud and abuse. Many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts and, as such, may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory, or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and government guidance, including but not limited to those involving the regulation of controlled substances, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and others, could subject us to federal or state government investigations or qui tam actions, and to liability for damages and civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, or pursue government contracts.

Healthcare Regulation: In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) significantly expanded health insurance coverage to uninsured Americans and changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private payers. There are also further efforts to broaden healthcare coverage. U.S. lawmakers also have explored proposals to reduce drug prices, including requiring price transparency and drug importation measures. Provincial governments in Canada that provide partial funding for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and independently regulate the sale and reimbursement of drugs have sought to reduce the costs of publicly funded health programs. For example, provincial governments have taken steps to reduce consumer prices for generic pharmaceuticals and, in some provinces, change professional allowances paid to pharmacists by generic manufacturers. Many European governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs. Some European governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending. These measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices. There is substantial uncertainty about the likelihood, timing and results of these health reform efforts.

11
McKESSON CORPORATION

Additionally, there have been increasing efforts by governments to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system, otherwise known as pedigree tracking. For example, the U.S. Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 (“DQSA”) requires us to participate in a federal prescription drug track and trace system that preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 requires the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies, such as track and trace or authentication technologies, to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. We also have record-keeping and other obligations under the E.U. Falsified Medicines Directive. Pedigree tracking laws such as these increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs.

Data Security and Privacy: We are subject to a variety of privacy and data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. For example, under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) we must maintain administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”) and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronic protected health information. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in the European Union, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”) in Canada, and the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”). Some privacy laws prohibit the transfer of personal information to certain other jurisdictions. We are subject to privacy and data protection compliance audits or investigations by various government agencies. Failure to comply with these laws subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, and other costs. We also have contractual obligations to customers that might be breached if we fail to comply with privacy laws. Our efforts to comply with privacy laws complicate our operations and add to our compliance costs. 

We and our external service providers use technology and systems to perform our business operations, such as the secure electronic transmission, processing, storage and hosting of sensitive information, including protected health information and other types of personal information, confidential financial information, proprietary information, and other sensitive information relating to our customers, company and workforce. Despite physical, technical, and administrative security measures that we implement in order to, among other things, address regulatory requirements, our technology systems and operations may continue to be subject to cybersecurity incidents. The risk of cybersecurity incidents may be increased due to a variety of factors, both internal and external. A cybersecurity incident might involve a material data breach or other material impact to the integrity and operations of the technology systems and operations, which might result in litigation or regulatory action.

Environmental Regulation: We are subject to many environmental and hazardous materials regulations, including those relating to radiation-emitting equipment operated at U.S. Oncology Network practices. Additionally, our operations are subject to regulations under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites, as discussed in more detail below. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if in the future we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws. We are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of our business. We meet this commitment through an environmental strategy and sustainability program.

We sold our chemical distribution operations in 1987 and retained responsibility for certain environmental obligations. Agreements with the Environmental Protection Agency and certain states may require environmental assessments and cleanups at several closed sites. These matters are described further in Financial Note 19, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when the Company considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals, including that related to our legacy chemical distribution operations, presently are not material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental matters. Other than the expected expenditures that may be required in connection with our legacy chemical distribution operations, we do not anticipate making substantial capital expenditures either for environmental issues or to comply with environmental laws, regulations, or government guidance in the future. The amount of our capital expenditures for environmental compliance was not material in 2021 and is not expected to be material in the next year.

Climate Change Regulation: Governments in the U.S. and abroad are considering new or expanded laws to address climate change. Such laws may include limitations on greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, mandates that companies implement processes to monitor and disclose climate-related matters, additional taxes or offset charges on specified energy sources, and other requirements. Compliance with climate-related laws may be further complicated by disparate regulatory approaches in various jurisdictions. New or expanded climate-related laws could impose substantial costs on us. Until the timing and extent of climate-related laws are clarified, we cannot predict their potential effect on our capital expenditures or our results of operations.

Other Information about the Business

Customers: During 2021, sales to our ten largest customers, including group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) accounted for approximately 51% of our total consolidated revenues. Sales to our largest customer, CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), accounted for approximately 21% of our total consolidated revenues in 2021. In May 2019, we extended our pharmaceutical distribution relationship with CVS to June 2023. Our ten largest customers comprised approximately 32%, and CVS was approximately 19%, of total trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2021. We also have agreements with GPOs, each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of member hospitals, pharmacies and other healthcare providers, as well as with government entities and agencies. The accounts receivable balances are with individual members of the GPOs, and therefore no significant concentration of credit risk exists. Substantially all of these revenues and accounts receivable are included in our U.S. Pharmaceutical segment. 

Suppliers: We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for more than 7% of our purchases in 2021. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally sound. The ten largest suppliers in 2021 accounted for approximately 50% of our purchases. 

Some of our distribution arrangements with the manufacturers provides us compensation based on a percentage of our purchases. In addition, we have certain distribution arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers that include an inflation-based compensation component whereby we benefit when the manufacturers increase their prices as we sell our existing inventory at the new higher prices. For these manufacturers, a reduction in the frequency and magnitude of price increases, as well as restrictions in the amount of inventory available to us, could have an adverse impact on our gross profit margin.

Research and Development: Research and development (“R&D”) expenses were $74 million, $96 million, and $71 million during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.
