PART I

 ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Founded in 1941, Coach, Inc., the predecessor to Tapestry, Inc. (the "Company"), was incorporated in the state of Maryland in 2000. During fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Stuart Weitzman Holdings LLC, a luxury women's footwear company. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company acquired Kate Spade & Company, a lifestyle accessories and ready-to-wear company. Later in fiscal 2018, the Company changed its name to Tapestry, Inc.

Tapestry, Inc. is a leading New York-based house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle brands. Our global house of brands unites the magic of Coach, kate spade new york and Stuart Weitzman. Each of our brands are unique and independent, while sharing a commitment to innovation and authenticity defined by distinctive products and differentiated customer experiences across channels and geographies. We use our collective strengths to move our customers and empower our communities, to make the fashion industry more sustainable, and to build a company that’s equitable, inclusive, and diverse. Individually, our brands are iconic. Together, we can stretch what’s possible.

OUR STRATEGY

Acceleration Program

The Company has implemented a strategic growth plan after undergoing a review of its business under its multi-year growth agenda (the "Acceleration Program"). The guiding principle of the Company’s multi-year growth agenda under the Acceleration Program is to better meet the needs of each of its brands' unique customers by:

•Sharpening our Focus on the Consumer: Operating with a clearly defined purpose and strategy for each brand and an unwavering focus on the consumer at the core of everything we do

•Leveraging Data and Leading with a Digital-First Mindset: Building significant data and analytics capabilities to drive decision-making and increase efficiency; Offering immersive customer experiences across our e-commerce and social channels to meet the needs of consumers who are increasingly utilizing digital platforms to engage with brands; Rethinking the role of stores with an intent to optimize our fleet

•Transforming into a Leaner and More Responsive Organization: Moving with greater agility, simplifying internal processes and empowering teams to act quickly to meet the rapidly changing needs of the consumer. The Company achieved approximately $200 million of gross run rate expense savings in fiscal 2021 and remains on track to realize gross run-rate savings of $300 million.

Covid-19 Impact

Our business has been significantly impacted by Covid-19. In response, the Company took strategic actions to reinforce its liquidity and financial flexibility, as well as to comply with local regulations to protect employees and customers. While the ongoing pandemic continues to present challenges, such as the supply chain related pressures facing the industry, store closures and other additional actions necessary to protect our stakeholders, the Company has been adapting to the current environment by remaining flexible in the short-term while continuing to focus on its long-term strategy and multi-year growth agenda. 

OUR BRANDS

The Company has three reportable segments:

•Coach includes global sales of Coach products to customers through Coach operated stores, including e-commerce sites and concession shop-in-shops, and sales to wholesale customers and through independent third party distributors. This segment represented 74.0% of total net sales in fiscal 2021.

•Kate Spade includes global sales primarily of kate spade new york brand products to customers through Kate Spade operated stores, including e-commerce sites, sales to wholesale customers, through concession shop-in-shops and through independent third party distributors.

Corporate, which is not a reportable segment, represents certain costs that are not directly attributable to a brand. These costs primarily include administrative and information systems expense. 

Coach

Coach is a leading design house of modern luxury accessories and lifestyle collections, with a long-standing reputation built on quality craftsmanship. Defined by a free-spirited, all-American attitude, the brand approaches design with a modern vision, reimagining luxury for today with an authenticity and innovation that is uniquely Coach. All over the world, the Coach name is synonymous with effortless New York style. 

Stores — Coach operates freestanding flagship, retail and outlet stores as well as concession shop-in-shop locations. These stores are located in regional shopping centers, metropolitan areas throughout the world and established outlet centers.

Coach flagship stores, which offer the fullest expression of the Coach brand, are located in tourist-heavy, densely populated cities globally. Retail stores carry an assortment of products depending on their size, location and customer preferences. Coach outlet stores serve as an efficient means to sell manufactured-for-outlet product and discontinued retail inventory outside the retail channel. The outlet store design, visual presentations and customer service levels support and reinforce the brand's image. Through these outlet stores, we target value-oriented customers in established outlet centers that are close to major markets.

The following table shows the number of Coach directly-operated locations and their total and average square footage:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

In fiscal 2022, we expect minimal change in overall store count with increases in store locations and square footage in Greater China and Japan, mostly offset by a reduction in store count in North America.

We custom tailor our assortments through wholesale product planning and allocation processes to match the attributes of our department store consumers in each local market. We continue to closely manage inventories in this channel given the current highly promotional environment at point-of-sale. We utilize automatic replenishment with major accounts in an effort to optimize inventory levels across wholesale doors. The wholesale business for Coach brand comprised approximately 9% of total segment net sales for fiscal 2021. As of July 3, 2021, Coach's products are sold in over approximately 1,700 wholesale and distributor locations globally.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Products made under license are, in most cases, sold through stores and wholesale channels and, with the Company's approval, the licensees have the right to distribute products selectively through other venues, which provide additional, yet controlled, exposure of our brands. Our licensing partners generally pay royalties on their net sales of our branded products. Such royalties currently comprise approximately 1% of Tapestry's total net sales. The licensing agreements generally give our brands the right to terminate the license if specified sales targets are not achieved.

PRODUCTS

The following table shows net sales for each of our product categories by segment:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)The significant majority of sales for Stuart Weitzman is attributable to women's footwear.

Women’s Handbags — Women’s handbag collections feature classically inspired as well as fashion designs. These collections are designed to meet the fashion and functional requirements of our broad and diverse consumer base.

Women’s Accessories — Women’s accessories include small leather goods which complement our handbags, including wallets, money pieces, wristlets and cosmetic cases. Also included in this category are novelty accessories (including address books, time management accessories, travel accessories, sketchbooks and portfolios), key rings and charms.

DESIGN AND MERCHANDISING

Our creative leaders are responsible for conceptualizing and implementing the design direction for our brands across the consumer touchpoints of product, stores and marketing. At Tapestry, each brand has a dedicated design and merchandising team; this ensures that Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman speak to their customers with a voice and positioning unique to their brand. Designers have access to the brands' extensive archives of product designs, which are a valuable resource for new product concepts. Our designers collaborate with strong merchandising teams that analyze sales, market trends and consumer preferences to identify market opportunities that help guide each season's design process and create a globally relevant product assortment. Leveraging our strategic investments in data and analytics tools across Tapestry's platform, merchandisers are able to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior that empowers our teams to respond to changes in consumer preferences and demand as well as scale opportunities across brands with greater speed and efficiency. Our merchandising teams are committed to managing the product life cycle to maximize sales and profitability across all channels. In fiscal year 2021, the Company took actions to reduce its SKU counts by 40% to 45% in order to optimize its product assortment to drive profitability. The product category teams, each comprised of design, merchandising, product development and sourcing specialists help each brand execute design concepts that are consistent with the brand's strategic direction.

Our design and merchandising teams also work in close collaboration with all of our licensing partners to ensure that the licensed products are conceptualized and designed to address the intended market opportunity and convey the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brands. 

MARKETING

We use a 360-degree approach to marketing for each of our brands, synchronizing our efforts across all channels to ensure consistency at every touchpoint. Our global marketing strategy is to deliver a consistent, relevant and multi-layered message every time the consumer comes in contact with our brands through our communications and visual merchandising. Each brand's distinctive positioning is communicated by our creative marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams, as well as outside creative agencies. We also have a sophisticated consumer and market research capability, which helps us assess consumer attitudes and trends.

We engage in several consumer communication initiatives globally, including direct marketing activities at a national, regional and local level. Total expenses attributable to the Company's marketing-related activities in fiscal 2021 were $395.2 million, or approximately 7% of net sales, compared to $238.0 million in fiscal 2020, or approximately 5% of net sales. 

Our wide range of marketing activities utilize a variety of media, including print, digital, social and out-of-home. Our respective brand websites serve as effective communication vehicles by providing an immersive brand experience, showcasing the fullest expression across all product categories.

As part of our direct marketing strategy, we use databases of consumers to generate personalized communications in direct channels such as email and text messages to drive engagement and build awareness. Email contacts are an important part of our communication and are sent to selected consumers to stimulate consumer purchases and build brand awareness. Visitors to our e-commerce sites provide an opportunity to increase the size of these consumer databases, in addition to serving as a point of transactions globally, except where restricted.

The Company has several regional informational websites for locations where we have not established an e-commerce presence. The Company utilizes and continues to explore digital technologies such as social media websites as a cost effective consumer communication opportunity to increase on-line and store sales, acquire new customers and build brand awareness.

MANUFACTURING

Tapestry carefully balances its commitments to a limited number of “better brand” partners that have demonstrated integrity, quality and reliable delivery. The Company continues to evaluate new manufacturing sources and geographies to deliver the finest quality products at the best cost and to mitigate the impact of manufacturing in inflationary markets. 

Before partnering with a new vendor, the Company evaluates each facility by conducting a quality and business practice standards audit. Periodic evaluations of existing, previously approved facilities are conducted on a recurring basis. We believe that our manufacturing partners are in material compliance with the Company’s integrity standards.

These independent manufacturers each or in aggregate support a broad mix of product types, materials and a seasonal influx of new, fashion-oriented styles, which allows us to meet shifts in marketplace demand and changes in consumer preferences. 

Our raw material suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensing partners must achieve and maintain high quality standards, which are an integral part of our brands' identity. One of our keys to success lies in the rigorous selection of raw materials. We have longstanding relationships with purveyors of fine leathers and hardware. Although our products are manufactured by independent manufacturers, we maintain a strong level of oversight in the selection of the raw materials that are used in all of our products. Compliance with quality control standards is monitored through on-site quality inspections at independent manufacturing facilities.

We maintain strong oversight of the supply chain process for each of our brands from design through manufacturing. We are able to do this by maintaining sourcing management offices in Vietnam, mainland China, the Philippines, Cambodia and Spain that work closely with our independent manufacturers. This broad-based, global manufacturing strategy is designed to optimize the mix of cost, lead times and construction capabilities. We have and may continue to experience disruptions at third-party manufacturing facilities across certain geographies. Refer to "Executive Overview" in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information.

During fiscal 2021, manufacturers of Coach products were primarily located in Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines and no individual vendor provided 10% or more of the brand's total purchases. During fiscal 2021, Kate Spade products were manufactured primarily in Vietnam, Cambodia and mainland China. Kate Spade had one vendor, located in Vietnam, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total purchases. The level of products manufactured in each country is expected to change for Coach and Kate Spade during fiscal 2022 as the brands continue to further diversify their supply chains globally. 

10

Stuart Weitzman products were primarily manufactured in Spain. During fiscal 2021, Stuart Weitzman had two vendors, both located in Spain, who individually provided over 10% of the brand's total units (or approximately 26% in the aggregate).

FULFILLMENT

The Company’s fulfillment network is designed to ship each brand's products from our manufacturers to fulfillment centers around the world for inspection, storage, order processing and delivery. These fulfillment centers are either directly operated by the Company or operated by independent third parties, and the Company began to leverage multi-brand fulfillment centers where appropriate. Our facilities use bar code scanning warehouse management systems, where our fulfillment center employees use handheld scanners to read product bar codes. This allows for accurate storage and order processing, and allows us to provide excellent service to our customers. Our products are primarily shipped to retail stores and wholesale customers, while some facilities also ship direct to consumer orders in markets where we have an e-commerce presence.

North America product fulfillment occurs at our facilities in the U.S. and Canada, which utilize our automated warehouse management system and electronic data interchange system, while the unique requirements of the direct to consumer business are supported by our order management and e-commerce sites as well as distribution systems operated by a third-party. The Company also operates local fulfillment centers in Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, U.K., Japan, Greater China, South Korea, Malaysia, Australia and Singapore, which are operated by third parties. The Company leverages other third party service providers as needed for product fulfillment in periods of high demand. Refer to Item 2. “Properties” for the Company’s key fulfillment centers. 

In July 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for a facility to be located in Las Vegas, Nevada. This facility is expected to become a multi-brand fulfillment center that is intended to increase capacity and continue to enhance fulfillment capabilities. 

INFORMATION SYSTEMS 

The Company’s information systems are integral in supporting the Company’s long-term strategies. Our information technology platform is a key capability used to support digital growth and drive consumer centricity and data-driven decision making. We are continually working on enhancing our digital technology platforms and elevating our e-commerce capabilities through new functionalities to our direct-to-consumer channels. In fiscal 2021, we successfully migrated the majority of our technology infrastructure to be cloud based. 

As part of our efforts to further streamline our information systems as part of a multi-brand platform, in fiscal 2020, the Company completed its multi-year Enterprise Resource Planning ("ERP") implementation, which supports the flow of information across all our brands and functions, including:

•Deployment of global finance, accounting, supply chain and human resource information systems across all brands. 

•Implementation of a global consolidation system, which provides a common platform for financial reporting. 

The Company is also implementing a point-of-sale system which supports all in-store transactions, distributes management reporting for each store, and collects sales and payroll information on a daily basis. This daily collection of store sales and inventory information results in early identification of business trends and provides a detailed baseline for store inventory replenishment. The implementation is complete for Coach and Stuart Weitzman stores and expected to be implemented for Kate Spade North America and Europe in fiscal 2022. 

Refer to Item 1A. "Risk Factors," for further information as it relates to the Company's ERP system implementation efforts. 

The Company maintains global information security and privacy compliance programs, comprised of risk management policies and procedures surrounding the Company’s information systems, cybersecurity practices and protection of consumer and employee personal data and confidential information. The Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of the Company’s risk management policies and procedures, and has delegated primary responsibility for monitoring the risks and programs in this area to the Audit Committee, which receives quarterly updates on information security and privacy risk and compliance. The Board of Directors receives periodic updates on these topics as well. As part of the Company’s compliance programs, all global employees are required to take annual training on information security, including cybersecurity, and global data privacy requirements and compliance measures. We also conduct periodic internal and third party assessments to test our cybersecurity controls, perform cyber simulations and annual tabletop exercises, and continually evaluate our privacy notices, policies and procedures surrounding our handling and control of personal data and the systems we have in place to help protect us from cybersecurity or personal data breaches. Additionally, we maintain network security and cyber liability insurance in order to provide a level of financial protection in the event of certain covered cyber losses and data breaches.

TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

Tapestry owns all of the material trademark rights around the world used in connection with the production, marketing, distribution and sale of all branded products for Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade. In addition, it licenses trademarks and copyrights used in connection with the production, marketing and distribution of certain categories of goods and limited edition collaborative special projects. Tapestry also owns and maintains registrations in countries around the world for trademarks in relevant classes of products. Major trademarks include TAPESTRY, COACH, STUART WEITZMAN, KATE SPADE and kate spade new york. It also owns brand-specific trademarks such as COACH and Horse & Carriage Design, COACH and Story Patch Design, COACH and Lozenge Design, COACH and Tag Design, Signature C Design for the COACH brand; kate spade new york and Spade Design, live colorfully and Walk on Air for the kate spade new york brand; and the stacked Stuart Weitzman Logo for the Stuart Weitzman brand. Tapestry is not dependent on any one particular trademark or design patent although Tapestry believes that the Coach, Stuart Weitzman and Kate Spade names are important for its business. In addition, Tapestry owns a number of design patents and utility patents for its brands' product designs. Tapestry aggressively polices its trademarks, and pursues infringers both domestically and internationally. It pursues counterfeiters through leads generated internally, as well as through its network of investigators, the respective online reporting form for each brand, the Tapestry hotline and business partners around the world.

The Company expects that its material trademarks will remain in full force and effect for as long as it continues to use and renew them. 

SEASONALITY

The Company's results are typically affected by seasonal trends. During the first fiscal quarter, we build inventory for the winter and holiday season. In the second fiscal quarter, working capital requirements are reduced substantially as we generate higher net sales and operating income, especially during the holiday season. 

Fluctuations in net sales, operating income and operating cash flows of the Company in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales, including adverse weather conditions or other macroeconomic events, such as Covid-19.

 GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Most of the Company's imported products are subject to duties, indirect taxes, quotas and non-tariff trade barriers that may limit the quantity of products that we may import into the U.S. and other countries or may impact the cost of such products. The Company is not materially restricted by quotas or other government restrictions in the operation of its business, however customs duties do represent a component of total product cost. To maximize opportunities, the Company operates complex supply chains through foreign trade zones, bonded logistic parks and other strategic initiatives such as free trade agreements. Additionally, the Company operates a direct import business in many countries worldwide. As a result, the Company is subject to stringent government regulations and restrictions with respect to its cross-border activity either by the various customs and border protection agencies or by other government agencies which control the quality and safety of the Company’s products. The Company maintains an internal global trade, customs and product compliance organization to help manage its import/export and regulatory affairs activity.

COMPETITION

The global premium women's and men's handbag, accessories and footwear categories are highly competitive. The Company competes primarily with European and American luxury and accessible luxury brands as well as private label retailers. Over the last decade, these industries have grown and are expected to continue to grow, encouraging the entry of new competitors as well as increasing the competition from existing competitors. This increased competition drives interest in these brand loyal categories. 

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

As a people-centered and purpose led Company, Tapestry’s corporate responsibility framework, Our Social Fabric, unites teams across the Company’s business to work to meet our 2025 Corporate Responsibility Goals and a shared objective: to create the modern luxury company of the future that balances true fashion authority with meaningful, positive change. Our Social Fabric focuses on three pillars: Our People, Our Planet and Our Communities.

The Company’s corporate responsibility strategy, including oversight, management and identification of risks, is ultimately governed by Board of Directors and driven by an Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance ("ESG") Task Force, which is comprised of senior leaders and cross-functional members from major business functions. The Board approves long-term sustainability goals, strategic moves or major plans of action and receives updates at least annually. During fiscal 2021, the Governance and Nominations Committee of the Board received quarterly updates on sustainability strategy.

The Company is a signatory to the United Nations ("UN") Global Compact, and as such, our corporate responsibility strategy is aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

HUMAN CAPITAL

At Tapestry, being true to yourself is core to who we are. When each of us brings our individuality to our collective ambition, our creativity is unleashed. This global house of brands was built by unconventional entrepreneurs and unexpected solutions, so when we say we believe in dreams, we mean we believe in making them happen. We’re always on a journey to becoming our best, but you can count on this: Here, everyone's voice is valued, ambitions are supported, and work is recognized. 

Where differences intersect, new thinking emerges. So we cultivate a place for people who are both warm and rigorous, work that is both challenging and fun, a culture led by both head and heart. Most of all, we bring together the unique spirits of our people and our brands and give them a place to move their work and our industry forward. We believe that difference sparks brilliance, so we welcome people and ideas from everywhere to join us in stretching what’s possible.

Governance and Oversight

Our Board of Directors and its committees provide governance and oversight of the Company's strategy, including over issues of human capital management. The Board has designated the Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors (the “HR Committee”) as the primary committee responsible for the Company’s human capital strategy, overseeing executive compensation programs, performance and talent development, succession planning, engagement and regular review of employee benefits and well-being strategies. Together with the Board, the HR Committee also provides oversight of the Company’s equity, inclusion and diversity strategies. The full Board of Directors and the HR Committee receive at least quarterly updates on the Company’s talent development strategies and other applicable areas of human capital management.

13

Unlocking the power of our people is a key strategic focus area for the Company, supported by significant engagement from the Company’s senior leadership on talent development and human capital management, as reflected in the key programs and focus areas described below.

Employees

As of July 3, 2021, the Company employed approximately 16,400 globally. Of these employees, approximately 13,100 employees worked in retail locations, of which 4,300 were part-time employees. This total excludes seasonal and temporary employees that the Company employs, particularly during the second quarter due to the holiday season. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good, and has never encountered a strike or work stoppage.

Equity, Inclusivity and Diversity

Our company name Tapestry, represents the diversity of our brands and the diversity of our people. We know that having a diverse range of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences makes us more innovative and successful and it brings us closer to our consumer. Our goal is to create a culture that is equitable, inclusive and diverse - where all of our employees, customers and stakeholders thrive. 

Our overachieving Equity, Inclusion and Diversity strategy is grounded in our purpose and values and will be a core element to unlocking the power of our people. There are four pillars under this strategy:

•Talent. Attract, retain and reward top diverse talent and enable them to thrive, personally and professionally in our global community.

•Culture. Empower people to express their distinctive strengths and power our engine of growth through leadership development, education and engagement programs.

•Community. Serve the communities that need the most support through empowerment programs, donations and volunteering.

•Marketplace. Develop solutions that set the standard for excellence through our platform of brands – for employees, customers, vendors, suppliers and our investors.

The Company has established an Inclusion Council, led by a diverse team of passionate employees, as well as several employee resource groups (“ERGs”) and task forces, connecting our employees to communities with the support of their colleagues and encouraging cultural awareness. Additionally, we believe educating the constituents of our Company is crucial in achieving EI&D. We have established a global multi-year Equity, Inclusion and Diversity learning road map, including bespoke inclusion and unconscious bias training programs to accommodate our dynamic employee population. Furthermore, the Company has focused on providing employees with resources to foster continuing education and conversation on EI&D through 'Tapestry UNSCRIPTED', which is an internal speaker series for our employees designed to bring our values to life. We feel hosting bold conversations like these about our values provides an opportunity for us to be inspired, discover ideas, and ignite personal passions.

Tapestry is committed to the support of underrepresented groups through our corporate efforts. We are a member of the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion, the largest business coalition committed to advancing Diversity and Inclusion.

Total Rewards

Tapestry is dedicated to being a place where our employees love to work, where they feel recognized and rewarded for all that they do. Maintaining a competitive program helps us attract, motivate and retain the key talent we need to achieve outstanding business and financial results. To accomplish this goal, we strive to appropriately align our total compensation with the pay, benefits and rewards offered by companies that compete with us for talent in the marketplace. 

Our Total Compensation Program includes cash pay, annual and long term incentives, benefits and other special programs that our employees value. We strive to pay each employee fairly and competitively across our brands. Tapestry's primary compensation principle is to "pay for performance." Tapestry's practice is to pay a competitive base salary and to provide employees with the opportunity to earn an annual bonus tied to Tapestry's and its brands' financial performance. Approximately 2,200 of our employees, including nearly all of our store managers, received an annual long term equity award in 2021, which supports alignment of employee interests with those of our stockholders, rewards employees for enhancing stock holder value and supports retention of key employees. In July 2021, Tapestry announced that it is committing to a $15 U.S. minimum wage for hourly employees effective September 5, 2021.

Our benefits package is designed to be competitive and comprehensive, which varies by location and jurisdiction. Our benefits, along with competitive pay, includes medical benefits and paid sick leave, in accordance with local policies and regulations, for directly hired full-time and part-time employees. The Company also offers retirement benefits for its employees, which are managed in accordance with local jurisdictions. To support employees in achieving their career and financial goals, the Company also provides access to learning opportunities on personal finances as well as physical and mental wellness through various platforms as available based on location.

Talent Acquisition and Development

Hiring talented employees is critically important to us, as we consider our employees around the world to be our greatest asset. Our recruitment and sourcing strategy focuses on tapping diverse sources to attract the best talent to our organization and then retaining them through our continued investments in resources that provide our employees with the tools for career advancement. Our internal opportunity program encourages employees to stretch themselves in their career development, aligning their capabilities with career interests and goals. We strive to provide a working environment where our people can grow and progress their careers within the Company. 

We are committed to helping our employees develop the knowledge, skills and abilities needed for continued success, and encourage employee development at all levels and every career stage. Our development programs serve to enable individual and team success through targeted initiatives and resources, offering a wide-ranging curriculum focused on professional and leadership development for leaders, managers, and individual contributors, including through our Common Thread people management program, Emerging Leaders High-Potential Program and Leader Transition Acceleration Program, in addition to other trainings and education facilitated through the Company for all employees. 

As a company, performance management is critical to our ability to reach our goals and foster a culture of success. By having a dynamic, performance-driven culture, we can achieve greater results, maximize employee, manager and team performance and offer exciting development and career opportunities. As our focus extends beyond the performance of our employees, but on the performance of our Company as a whole, we have mechanisms in place to facilitate comprehensive upward feedback through robust cross-functional feedback tools and a cadence of regular pulse surveys that inform on how we can continue to strive for excellence in our work culture. 

Well-being and Safety

At Tapestry, we are committed to providing a safe working environment for our people, as well as supporting our people in achieving and maintaining their health and well-being goals. Work-life integration is top of mind, and we provide resources and benefits to help achieve this balance. We provide our employees with supplemental resources to achieve wellness such as access to our Employee Assistance Program, regular employee programming and subscriptions to Headspace, a smartphone application dedicated to meditation and mindfulness. 

At Tapestry, we believe in encouraging and empowering our employees to take part in building a welcoming and inclusive community. We provide all employees supplemental time-off to perform community service through nonprofits of their personal choice and through team and Company sponsored volunteering events. In our commitment to supporting our communities, we have three foundations designated to provide monetary support to nonprofit organizations across communities that we are a part of. Additionally, on an annual basis, our foundations match up to $10,000 in donations to eligible non-profits per employee in North America. 

Beginning in fiscal 2020, we had to make changes to our operations in order to continue to prioritize the health and safety of our people in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Company implemented various safety measures, such as store closures in adherence to local regulation, increased sanitization, physical distancing and limited capacity, temperature and wellness checks as well as distribution of personal protective gear at our facilities. To do so, we engaged medical professionals to consult on our health and safety protocols through facilitation of Covid-19 education webinars for our employees on topics ranging from pandemic safety, vaccine education and mental wellness. We have also provided our employees with additional paid time off to receive their Covid-19 vaccine and recover from any resulting side effects. Many of our corporate employees have worked remotely since March 2020 and the Company continues to explore flexible work options through added resources and implementation of a hybrid working environment. Refer to the "Executive Overview" in Item 7. "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for additional information about the Company's response to the Covid-19 pandemic.
