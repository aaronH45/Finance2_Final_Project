Interest Rates

The table below provides information about the Company’s debt obligations sensitive to changes in interest rates. Substantially all of the debt shown in the table below is denominated in United States dollars. The fair value of fixed rate debt was approximately $170 million greater than carrying value at December 31, 2020 and approximately $100 million greater than carrying value at December 31, 2019. The fair value of the fixed rate debt was based on quoted prices in an active market. The fair value of variable rate debt is not significantly different from its recorded amount.

1In January 2019, we issued a $500 million five-year Term Loan A with our current bank group. We pay quarterly principal installments of $12.5 million through the maturity date of January 2024, at which time we will pay the remaining principal. Additional principal payments, including a complete early payoff, are allowed without penalty. As of December 31, 2020, we had repaid $195 million, including prepayments on a portion of Term Loan A of $60 million in the third quarter and $48 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Term Loan A bears a variable interest rate as defined in the agreement and was 3.0% at December 31, 2020. Interest is payable based upon a time interval that depends on the selection of interest rate period.

2The weighted average interest rate for the average commercial paper outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 2.0% and 2.6%, respectively. In January 2019, we increased the size of the revolving facility from $800 million to $1.2 billion, added a five-year $500 million term loan facility, and extended the term from 2022 to 2024.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company is subject to market and financial risks related to interest rates and foreign currency. In the normal course of business, the Company utilizes derivative instruments (individually or in combinations) to reduce or eliminate these risks. The Company seeks to use derivative contracts that qualify for hedge accounting treatment; however, some instruments may not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. It is the Company’s policy not to speculate using derivative instruments. Information regarding cash flow hedges and fair value hedges is provided in Note S beginning on page 127 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated by reference into this section.
