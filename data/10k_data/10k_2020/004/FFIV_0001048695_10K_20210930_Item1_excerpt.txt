Item 1.Business

General

F5 is a multi-cloud application security and delivery company. We see a world where we enable our customers’ applications to adapt to changing environments, automating redundant processes for greater efficiencies, expanding and contracting based on performance needs, protecting themselves, and securing points of vulnerability. Adaptive applications bring intelligence and real-time changes to the world of application deployments, which today are mostly static and manual.

Our enterprise-grade solutions are available in a range of consumption models, from on-premises to managed services, optimized for multi-cloud environments. In connection with our solutions, we offer a broad range of professional services, including consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other technical support services.

On January 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Volterra, a provider of edge-as-a-service platform solutions. The F5+Volterra platform will be designed to address challenges found with current edge solutions that are built on CDNs and have limited security features. F5’s new enterprise-focused edge will be security-first and app-driven, with unlimited scale.

Our customers include large enterprise businesses, public sector institutions, governments, and service providers. We conduct our business globally and manage our business by geography. Our business is organized into three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). 

Our revenue is comprised of services revenue and product revenue. While the majority of our product revenue today is derived from appliance sales, we are actively managing a transformation to a software- and SaaS-driven business with product revenue from software sales growing 40% in fiscal year 2021 and representing 40% of product revenue.

At the end of fiscal 2021, we had product backlog of approximately $124.9 million. Backlog is primarily systems-based and represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be fulfilled and invoiced, generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers, or product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be canceled by the customer prior to fulfillment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.

F5 was incorporated on February 26, 1996 in the state of Washington. Our headquarters is in Seattle, Washington, and our mailing address is 801 5th Avenue, Seattle, Washington 98104-1663. The telephone number at that location is (206) 272-5555. Our website is www.f5.com. We have 80 subsidiaries, branch offices, or representative offices worldwide.

Strategy and Priorities

3
F5 is focused on solving our customers’ most important application challenges and we have continued to evolve our business as our customer’s needs have changed. Today, our customers need to securely and cost effectively deliver extraordinary digital experiences to their end users, which include employees, consumers and partners. F5’s portfolio of multi-cloud application security and delivery technologies enables our customers to scale, secure and optimize both traditional and modern applications, making those amazing digital experiences possible. Adaptive applications utilize an architectural approach that can rapidly respond to changes in performance, global availability, or security problems across one or more infrastructure environments and with little to no human interaction. These apps are enabled by a near-real-time collection of live application telemetry, analyzed by machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, and harnessed to automation toolchains to rapidly adjust infrastructure to new conditions. 

Key components of our strategy include:

Bringing our adaptive application vision to life 

F5 is uniquely positioned to deliver adaptive applications. Through our organic investments and the acquisitions of NGINX in May 2019, Shape Security in January 2020, and Volterra in January 2021, we have assembled the broadest portfolio of application security and delivery technologies in the market today. As a result of the continued evolution of our BIG-IP family, we enable customers to transition traditional applications from data centers to multi-cloud environments while maintaining private data center levels of security. At the same time, we are enabling modern application architectures with our NGINX technologies, F5 SaaS offerings, and Aspen Mesh. Our State of Application Strategy Report 2021 shows 87% of organizations are managing a complex application portfolio spanning traditional and modern architectures. F5 is unique in our ability to span both traditional and modern architectures, as a result, our customers are able to provision consistent, and industry-leading application security across their combined traditional and modern application portfolio. In addition, we are leveraging our access to application data and our analytics capabilities to enable automation and unlock business insights for our customers.

Transforming how customers experience F5

As we expand the role we play for our customers, we are also transforming how our customers experience F5. We have made it easier for our customers to procure, deploy, manage, and upgrade our technologies by introducing new consumption models and continuing to evolve our solutions’ capabilities. 

As we have expanded our offerings, we are better able to solve a broader range of customer challenges and increasingly, customers are choosing a suite of F5 solutions. Going forward we will leverage and grow our foundational capabilities in data and insights, digital sales, and SaaS-delivered capabilities to deliver consistent world-class customer experiences, including simple, integrated and friction-free consumption of our technologies. We will continue to improve customer awareness and understanding of F5’s expanded portfolio with a focus on buying personas and business needs and intend to enhance our digital customer experiences to deliver both growth and efficiency.

Capturing growth in security and software

Our ability to serve both traditional and modern architectures means we are uniquely suited to provide consistent, industry-leading security across our customers entire application estate. Over the last ten years, enterprises were focused on protecting their networks from attack. Attacks are now focused on the applications with threats like malware, bots, and API penetration.

Our acquisition of Shape Security brings the leader in online fraud and abuse prevention, adding protection against automated attacks, bots, and targeted fraud, to F5’s world-class portfolio of application security and delivery technologies. Volterra’s SaaS platform will help detect threats more rapidly and reduce neutralization times. Together, F5’s portfolio provides maximum protection and reduced risk for all applications across data centers, cloud, and the edge. This reduces our customers’ total cost of application security by reducing standalone products and leveraging a unified portfolio of on-premises and SaaS-based controls.

In the last several years, we have significantly enhanced and expanded our software offerings. Our meaningful software growth over the last two years has largely been driven by steps we have taken to improve automation and orchestration in our BIG-IP software, making it easier to procure, deploy and upgrade, as well as the introduction of new flexible commercial models, including annual and longer-term subscriptions. We expect to drive continued software and SaaS growth from additional enhancements to our BIG-IP family, as well as advancements and continued customer adoption of NGINX, application security, Shape, and Volterra solutions.

F5 Products and Solutions

F5’s portfolio of multi-cloud application security and delivery technologies are enabling customers to address the challenges of delivering differentiated digital experiences to their customers.

Simplifying traditional app delivery for multi-cloud environments

Our BIG-IP family of offerings provides feature-rich, highly programmable and configurable application delivery solutions for traditional applications in enterprises and service providers. Traditional applications are based on monolithic, three-tier, or client-server architectures. Such traditional applications are the most ubiquitous application architecture today, and many organizations continue to rely exclusively on traditional applications to power the most mission-critical business applications, customer facing digital interfaces and internally used applications.

For most organizations, the priority around traditional applications is maximizing operational efficiency and minimizing the total cost of ownership. BIG-IP has established itself as the leading application security and delivery technology for traditional applications, providing load balancing, and DNS (domain name system) services. Many customers also use the advanced security capabilities of BIG-IP, including WAF (web application firewall), carrier-grade firewall and NAT (network address translation), identity-aware proxy, SSL-VPN, and SSL (securer sockets layer) offloading, that are available as tightly-integrated modules or extensions. Via the F5 Automation Toolchain, BIG-IP capabilities easily integrate into orchestration frameworks such as Ansible, HashiCorp Terraform, OpenShift, and Cloud Foundry as part of a CI/CD pipeline. BIG-IPs “best-of-suite” approach helps standardize and consolidate application delivery and security functions into a single solution, and enables automating the functions to reduce operational cost.

BIG-IP capabilities are available in software-only Virtual Editions (VEs) that deploy on any standard hypervisor in private and public clouds and are available in many performance throughput options. VEs can be deployed on public clouds, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform, through Bring Your Own License (BYOL) and the public cloud marketplaces. VEs are available via utility pricing (via public cloud marketplaces), short- and long-term subscriptions, and perpetual licensing models. In addition, F5 offers customers additional licensing, consumption flexibility, and value via our flexible consumption program or multi-year subscriptions. 

F5 BIG-IQ Centralized Management provides central management, analytics, and automation for BIG-IP instances. Available in virtual or physical form factors, BIG-IQ simplifies, enhances management of, and reduces customer operational costs associated with BIG-IP deployments. 

F5’s physical systems are designed to enhance the performance of our software by leveraging a combination of custom FPGA logic and off-the-shelf silicon, providing a balance of cost and flexibility. Currently, we offer two types of physical configurations: BIG-IP iSeries appliances and chassis-based VIPRION and VELOS systems. Both BIG-IP iSeries and our chassis-based systems run the same BIG-IP software modules as are available in the Virtual Edition and are licensed on a perpetual basis or subscription basis. To help customers comply with regulatory requirements and protect sensitive data, our physical systems are certified up to NIST FIPS 140-2 Level 2 and Common Criteria Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL 4+). BIG-IP iSeries appliances and chassis-based systems differ primarily in their performance and size characteristics resulting from the hardware components and configurations that make up these systems. As we align to modern architectures, we also added the VELOS chassis-based system to our lineup. VELOS relies on a Kubernetes-based platform layer that is integrated tightly with F5’s TMOS software. In addition, going to a microservice-based platform layer allows VELOS to provide new and exciting features that were not possible in previous generations of F5 BIG-IP platforms. 

Enabling modern app delivery at scale

To better address the needs of digitally transforming enterprises that have a mix of traditional, three-tier architectures and cloud-first microservices architectures, our NGINX technologies offer lightweight, agile ADC and API management software for container-built applications, CI/CD workflows, and microservices. Our NGINX technology enables developer and DevOps agility to get applications to market quickly, with security and automation closer to the code. 

Our NGINX product offerings are:

•NGINX Plus, an all-in-one load balancer, web server, content cache, and API gateway for modern applications.

•NGINX Controller, which provides orchestration and analytics for NGINX Plus.

•NGINX Ingress Controller and NGINX Service Mesh, which provide traffic management for Kubernetes clusters.

•NGINX App Protect, which integrates F5’s market-leading WAF with the flexibility and performance of NGINX Plus.

5
We believe NGINX solutions help our customers enable adaptive applications in container, cloud-native, and microservices environments, providing the ease-of-use and flexibility developers require while also delivering the scale, security, reliability, and enterprise readiness network operations teams demand.

F5 SaaS offerings support modern cloud application delivery and security use cases for cloud-native applications, making it easier for developers and DevOps engineers to build in the application services required for production.

Securing applications and APIs everywhere

F5’s advanced application security services, including DDoS (distributed denial of service) mitigation, WAF (web application firewall), bot protection, SSL/TLS traffic decryption, and API discovery/control provide best-in-class protection for applications and infrastructure across any deployment model, from on-premises to multi-cloud to the network edge.

For protecting web applications from advanced threats and malware, F5 has several solutions. F5 Advanced WAF has been an industry-leading web application firewall for many years. It employs countermeasures to detect and stop evolving application-layer threats, integrating behavioral analysis and dynamic code injections as its two main mechanisms to more completely assess the threat associated with any given client session.

NGINX App Protect provides web application protection with self-service access and API-driven integration into automation and orchestration frameworks. Often referred to as “shifting security left,” this ensures security is applied earlier in the software development lifecycle and covers the full portfolio of modern and long-tail applications in the enterprise.

Shape's technology addresses the increasing sophistication of automated bot attacks as well as fraud and abuse. Shape’s artificial intelligence platform protects the largest banks, airlines, retailers, and federal agencies against bots and fraud which bypass best-practice industry security controls. Shape protects more than one billion accounts worldwide against credential stuffing attacks, the industry’s leading cybersecurity threat.

Shape’s advanced technology consists of next-generation client-side JavaScript and SDKs (software development kits), horizontally scalable reverse proxy and API services, and large-scale machine learning, analytics, and data platform systems, which work together to deliver the highest anti-fraud efficacy in the industry. This technology is sold as integrated, fully-managed services in an “outcome-as-a-service” cybersecurity model.

Volterra provides advanced machine learning (ML)-based API protection through API auto-discovery and control. Volterra VoltMesh automatically discovers all APIs in an application environment without the need for manual DevOps/DevSecOps actions. It then automatically allows only those APIs that are safe and required for a given workflow. It also baselines API activity and continually monitors for anomalous behavior to ensure ongoing protection in the often-dynamic environment of modern applications.

Silverline provides customers fully-managed application security. Current offerings include Silverline Web Application Firewall, Silverline DDoS Protection, and Silverline Threat Intelligence Services. These services provide enterprise and service provider customers with F5’s proven security technologies coupled with world-class security professionals. Silverline’s Security Operations Center experts set up, manage, and support each customer's application solutions as an extension to the customer’s staff. In F5’s third fiscal quarter, Shape technology was combined with F5's Silverline managed services platform to launch Silverline Shape Defense, creating a version of Shape’s technology platform capabilities for customers who prefer a managed service.

Depending on the level of protection required, customers can route traffic through the Silverline cloud-based platform 24/7 or only when an attack is detected. Silverline Managed Services also provides an affordable and straightforward deployment alternative for customers who want to minimize the upfront costs and expense of maintaining on-premises solutions. For large enterprises, subscribing to Silverline Managed Services in conjunction with our on-premises DDoS Hybrid Defender and Advanced WAF can provide the first line of defense against attacks, and prevent them from having a significant downtime impact on their application or network services.

Unlocking the value of application insights

Shape’s technology platform enables generalized AI-powered user analytics. While Shape has focused on using these capabilities to detect advanced fraud and abuse, going forward, the same technology is being integrated throughout F5 to create general AI-powered user analytics capabilities within and beyond cybersecurity use cases.

Service Provider Solutions

6
BIG-IP offerings also comprise our service provider solutions that address the complex requirements for enabling fast, secure, reliable communications among the elements of existing infrastructures such as 4G/LTE and evolving to newly designed cloud-native 5G networks, network functions virtualization (NFV) environments, and edge computing.

In addition to the solutions described above, F5 also offers solutions for fixed and mobile service provider customers to enable fast, secure, reliable communications in their networks. These solutions include intelligent traffic management services to classify and manipulate network traffic to successfully manage and migrate to newer technologies such as IPv4 to IPv6 and 4G to 5G. Our carrier-class network firewall services are used to secure the Gi/N6 interface, secure signaling threats and IoT applications, and detect and mitigate DDoS attacks. Our solutions are also used by our customers to secure complex signaling for mobility protocols like Diameter, SIP, and GTP, as well as IoT protocols. All F5 software solutions can be delivered on dedicated F5 hardware, as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) that can use F5 VNF Manager or other industry solutions to deploy and manage VNF instances, and are evolving as Container Network Functions (CNF).

Competition

As F5 expands its reach and role into a broader set of multi-cloud solutions, the companies that we consider competitors evolves as well. In addition to server load balancing, traffic management, and other functions normally associated with application delivery, our suite of solutions has expanded our addressable market into security, and policy management, where we compete with a number of companies focused on niche areas of application security.

Within application delivery, we compete against Citrix Systems and a number of other competitors that have a smaller market presence or limited feature set, such as Amazon Web Services, HAProxy, Kemp Technologies, Microsoft Azure, and VMware.

We see emerging demand to support modern, container-based applications with new capabilities including managing APIs, optimizing Kubernetes traffic management, load balancing cloud-native and hybrid cloud applications and providing service mesh. For these use cases, we compete against emerging players like Apogee and Kong.

In application security, we compete with companies that provide web application firewalls, bot detection and mitigation, carrier-grade firewall, carrier-grade NAT, SSL orchestration, access policy management, DDoS protection, and fraud defense. Competitors include Akamai, Citrix Systems, Imperva, Juniper Networks, and Symantec/Blue Coat. With the addition of Shape, additional fraud, abuse, and analytics solutions become indirect competitors, including Akamai, Cloudflare, Imperva (Distil Networks), Fastly (Signal Sciences) and PerimeterX.

Volterra’s use cases include multi-cloud networking, as well as security offered as SaaS, competing with the likes of Imperva, Fastly, Akamai, and Cloudflare.

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include form factor, consumption model, ecosystem integrations, features and performance, customer support, brand recognition, scope of distribution and sales channels, and pricing. Some of our competitors have already tried or plan to adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. However, because F5 offers superior performance, broad functionality, including lighter-weight options with NGINX and Volterra, we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies.

Corporate Functions

Customer Services and Technical Support

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of professional services including consulting, training, installation, maintenance, and other technical support services.

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise and service provider customers. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that includes installation, phone and online technical support, hardware repair and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting, and training services.

We provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners. Our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base.

Product Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers and partners. Our engineering 

7
organization uses standard processes for the development, documentation, and quality control of services, software, and systems that are designed to meet these goals. These processes include working with our business development and marketing teams, customers, and partners to identify technology innovation opportunities to better meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets.

Over 90 percent of our engineers are engaged in software, SaaS, and managed services development in several major locations including Seattle, Washington; Hyderabad, India; Tel Aviv, Israel; San Jose and San Francisco, California; Cork, Ireland; and Moscow, Russia.

Our hardware engineering team is located in Spokane, Washington; San Jose, California; and Tel Aviv, Israel.

Smaller development sites including Boulder, Colorado; Warsaw, Poland; and Billerica, Massachusetts also support the core development teams in the larger centers.

Members of all our engineering teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our solutions.

We believe that robust and constant innovation is a necessity for F5, so we are also innovating in new ways. For more than a year now, we have had dedicated teams focused on testing new disruptive innovations in technology, business models, or customer segments. We expect innovations resulting from the work of these teams will be complementary to our goal of delivering the broadest and most consistent portfolio of solutions across cloud and on-premises environments.

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. F5 holds 433 patents in the United States and has 59 international patents (with applications pending for various aspects of our technology). Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our products. These are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination. While we may not be able to renew all of these licenses in the future, we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we had research and product development expenses of $512.6 million, $441.3 million, and $408.1 million, respectively.

Sales and Marketing

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global 1000 companies, including those in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing, healthcare, and government. In fiscal year 2021, sales outside of the Americas represented 44.0% of our net revenues. Refer to Note 16 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area.

Sales

We sell our products and services to large and medium enterprise customers, including federal government entities, financial services customers and service providers through a variety of routes to market and channels. Our sales teams sell our products and services directly to customers by working closely with our channel partners including distributors, value-added resellers (VARs), managed service providers (MSPs), and systems integrators.

F5 sales teams. Our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads from marketing and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources. Our outside sales team works directly with partners and customers across the globe. Our field sales personnel are located in major cities in three sales regions: the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to sell our products and services to their customers. We reward partners that identify new business and provide sales expertise for our portfolio of products and solutions through various incentive programs. Systems engineers, with deep technical domain expertise, support our regional sales account managers and channel partners providing pre-sale technical solution engineering and support, as needed.

8
Distributors, VARs, and MSPs. As a key component of our sales strategy, we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors, local and specialized distributors, VARs, and MSPs. We derive a majority of our product sales from VARs and MSPs, relying on our large distributors for fulfillment, training, and partner enablement.

Our agreements with our channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These agreements typically have one-year terms with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year 2021, sales to two of our worldwide distributors, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Synnex Corporation represented 19.2% and 11.1% of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 90 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. The agreements grant certain distributors the right to distribute our products to resellers, with no minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators. We also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators, including Dell Services, DXC, HP Enterprise Services, and IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components of application deployments or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead they typically recommend and/or manage our products as a part of broader solutions supporting enterprise applications and Internet facing systems that incorporate our technology for security, high availability, and enhanced performance.

Resellers and technology partners. Historically, our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors. Currently, we partner with many technology partners and public cloud providers who resell our products. We have ongoing partnerships with the major cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform and have expanded our reseller routes to market to include their public cloud marketplaces. F5 has recently signed a Strategic Collaboration Agreement (SCA) with AWS, and are actively engaged with Microsoft Azure on private offers levering our software on Azure. Our business development team manages these relationships and closely monitors adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market.

Marketing

As we continue to expand our offerings and advance our range of consumption models (e.g., from on-premises to managed services), we continue to focus on driving a compelling and unique value proposition of F5 among our existing customers as well as new buying centers. In addition to revitalizing our brand in the market, our expansion into new buying centers among existing customers (DevOps for example), exploration of new routes to market (such as public cloud marketplaces), and acquisition of a host of net new customers, compels us to increase our focus and investments in more digitally-enabled, personalized and effortless experiences at scale.

We are increasing our focus on efforts to drive momentum behind our brand and reputation to deliver clarity, guidance and inspiration among our existing customers, future customers, partners, and employees around our evolving strategy behind F5’s unique offering. Additionally, to best support our growth as we transform our role in driving value for our customers, we are transforming marketing from a cost center to a revenue center to serve as a meaningful and predictable source of opportunities, customer growth and revenues. The critical success factors in this shift are increased investments in digital technologies, requisite competencies, and shifting our culture to adopt an agile mindset as we use data to constantly improve our contributions to our customers and ultimately our shareholders.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware platforms to a third-party contract manufacturer, Flex Ltd. ("Flex"), for building, assembling, and testing according to our specifications at Flex's facilities in Guadalajara, Mexico and Zhuhai, China. Flex also performs the following activities on our behalf: material procurement, PCB assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control, and direct shipment. 

We provide a rolling forecast that allows Flex to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity, and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end-user demand. Flex procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products, and tests them according to our specifications. Generally, we do not own the system components. Hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components. Many of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However, we currently purchase several hardware components used in the assembly of our products from a number of single or limited 

9
sources. Lead times for these components vary significantly and are increasing in light of global shortages of critical components. Global supply chain constraints in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to decrease our visibility into component availability and lead times even for commodity components. Also, if the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Systems built in Guadalajara are shipped to the Flex fulfillment center in Milpitas, California for distribution primarily to distributors, value-added resellers, or end users in EMEA and the Americas. Systems built and fulfilled in Zhuhai are for distribution to partners and customers in APAC. Title to the products transfers from Flex to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location.

Employees

As of September 30, 2021, we had 6,461 employees – over 99% of whom were full time employees. Our employees are in 47 countries with 52% of employees in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are in good standing, as evidenced by our bi-annual employee engagement survey results.

Culture and engagement

In 2018, we defined and launched BeF5. BeF5 conveys our Guiding Principle of “Do the right thing” and the five behaviors which unite F5ers and which we expect all employees to emulate. In early 2021, these behaviors were updated (updating “We choose speed” to “We make F5 more agile”) and language to describe each was refined based on employee feedback. 

In 2019, we defined and created our principles for leadership, referred to as LeadF5.

10
Communications, performance management, development, and a number of other employee engagement activities connect and reinforce BeF5 and LeadF5. 

F5 supports employees and our culture through competitive benefits, regular communications through formal (quarterly all hands with extensive question and answer sessions with execs) and informal (“Monday Minute” newsletter and company intranet) means, and a quarterly Zoom Out Day, dedicated to learning and exploring new ideas. During the current global crisis surrounding COVID-19, racial injustice, political uncertainty and natural disasters, we have provided employees and leaders with a variety of support and resources to help them thrive, including new wellness programs, educational series, and four additional days of time off dedicated to wellness. 

F5 also provides flexible working opportunities through our Freedom to Flex program which allows employees to choose whether to work in an office, remotely or a blend of the two. Established in 2018, Freedom to Flex has provided the foundation for our flexibility throughout the pandemic and will continue to remain in place after it is safe to re-open all offices fully. Most of our workforce will have the option to remain working remotely some or all of the time. To support the increased use of the Freedom to Flex program going forward, resources and learning opportunities are available for managers and leaders to assist in effectively leading hybrid teams (defined as teams which have some employees in office and others remote from office), and technology to support ongoing connection and productivity among these hybrid teams.

Employee experience and sentiment is measured through global employee surveys at least twice each year, with Belonging (“I feel a sense of belonging at F5”) as our keystone measure. As of May 2021, employees reported high satisfaction on several key questions:

•81% of employees favorably rate “I feel a sense of belonging at F5."

•88% of employees favorably rate “I am proud to work for F5."

•87% of employees favorably rate “F5 really demonstrates a commitment to ‘We create a more diverse and inclusive F5’”

•87% of employees favorably rate “F5 has a great culture."

•94% of employees favorably rate “F5 has demonstrated that employee well-being and health is a priority during the coronavirus outbreak."

Growth and development

Ongoing development of our workforce is supported across multiple learning organizations within F5, providing opportunities to improve technical and professional knowledge, better understand our business and products, and strengthen management and leadership. Example opportunities include a mentoring program, LeadF5 Coaching, which provides an opportunity for several hundred employees to receive professional and personal coaching annually, and through learning paths created to support specific areas of knowledge, including deepening their knowledge of BeF5 and LeadF5. Employees have access to multiple third-party resources to enhance the learning opportunities developed internally. 

Diversity and Inclusion

F5 believes our differences—when embraced with humility and respect—drive smarter decisions, increased innovation, stronger performance, and a culture where everyone can be themselves and reach their full potential. 

Employee Inclusion Groups (EIGs) – F5 Ability, F5 Appreciates Blackness, F5 Connects Women, F5 Latinx e Hispanos Unidos, F5 Military Veterans, F5 Multicultural and F5 Pride – bring people together across F5 around the world. All seven EIGs are led by employees, with a dedicated annual budget and executive sponsor. F5’s EIG leaders participate in an F5 sponsored leadership development program with dedicated time toward cultivating their EIG and growing as a leader themselves. In fiscal 2021, our EIG leaders received an end of the year bonus for their contributions. Participation in these leadership roles will be bonus eligible going forward. In this way, F5 continues to invest in a thriving community of diverse individuals.

We have also steadily increased our transparency in both our actions and the accompanying results culminating in our inaugural F5 Diversity and Inclusion Report available at f5.com. Therein, you will see progress made on both our culture of belonging and representation at F5. We continue to actively build a culture where everyone feels they can be themselves and reach their full potential.

Compensation and Benefits

F5 offers a competitive Total Rewards package intended to attract, retain and motivate our employees. Our package includes market-competitive pay, incentive plans, restricted stock unit grants (RSUs), an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, retirement plans, healthcare, paid time off and family leave. 

11
Environmental, Social & Governance

At F5, we care deeply not just about what we do, but how we do it. We consider this our “human-first” approach to the way we conduct our business, and it is reflected in our expanded commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) – extending from the environmental sustainability of our products and operations to the well-being of our employees and our communities. 

Environmental. F5 is committed to business practices that preserve the environment upon which our society and economy depend. As we develop a comprehensive program that recognizes F5’s full environmental impact, our focus is on: expanding the volume of our environmental data collection; increasing the breadth of our environmental disclosures; standardizing our carbon reporting processes and metrics; and exploring all options for carbon reduction, mitigation and removal. This will result in F5 disclosing science-aligned targets for Scope 1 and 2 in fiscal year 2022 and declaring 2030 Science-based targets with the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) in fiscal year 2023. 

Social. In addition to the employee programs and benefits outlined in the Human Capital Management section above, we continue to prioritize F5 Global Good, the community development initiative that amplifies our employee engagement and diversity and inclusion programs. In fiscal year 2021, more than half of all worldwide employees participated in Global Good programs, volunteering over 6,000 hours and directing the entirety of F5’s donations, through both the company matching program and grant selection committees. F5 and its employees donated over $4.8 million to over 2,900 non-profits worldwide in fiscal year 2021. 

Governance. Our guiding principle to do the right thing for each other, our customers, our shareholders, and our communities is set forth in F5’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, compliance training programs and most importantly, in the behaviors and principles we measure all employees on: BeF5 and LeadF5. In addition, F5 added oversight of our ESG programs by expanding the charter of the Nominating and Governance Committee of the board of directors, as well as expanded our ESG disclosures aligned to the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) in our inaugural F5 ESG Report available at investors.f5.com.
