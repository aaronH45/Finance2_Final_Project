Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Company. The discussion focuses on our financial results for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 (fiscal year 2021) and the fiscal year ended April 24, 2020 (fiscal year 2020). A discussion on our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared the year ended April 26, 2019 (fiscal year 2019) is included in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended April 24, 2020, filed with the SEC on June 19, 2020, and is incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. You should read this discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto at April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020 and for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, which are presented within "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Amounts reported in millions within this annual report are computed based on the amounts in thousands, and therefore, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Additionally, certain columns and rows within tables may not sum due to rounding.

Throughout this Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we present certain financial measures that we use to evaluate the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning; however, such financial measures are not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP). These financial measures are considered "non-GAAP financial measures" and are intended to supplement, and should not be considered as superior to, financial measures presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We generally use non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the Company and as a basis for strategic planning. We believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the Company's underlying operational performance and trends and may facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the medical technologies industry.

As presented in the GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations section below, our non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of certain charges or benefits that contribute to or reduce earnings and that may affect financial trends, and include certain charges or benefits that result from transactions or events that we believe may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to our operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments). 

In the event there is a Non-GAAP Adjustment recognized in our operating results, the tax cost or benefit attributable to that item is separately calculated and reported. Because the effective rate can be significantly impacted by the Non-GAAP Adjustments that take place during the period, we often refer to our tax rate using both the effective rate and the non-GAAP nominal tax rate (Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate). The Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate is calculated as the income tax provision, adjusted for the impact of Non-GAAP Adjustments, as a percentage of income before income taxes, excluding Non-GAAP Adjustments.

Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by subtracting property, plant, and equipment additions from operating cash flows.

Refer to the “GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations," "Income Taxes," and "Free Cash Flow" sections for reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

EXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW

The global healthcare system faces an unprecedented challenge as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. COVID-19 had an adverse impact on certain aspects of our Company and business, including the demand for and supply of certain of our products, operations, supply chains and distribution systems, impacts or delays to product development milestones, clinical trials, or regulatory clearances and approval timing. Most of our businesses were affected by a decline in procedural volumes as a result of COVID-19 largely during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and the first two quarters of fiscal year 2021. However, we have seen a recovery in most of our businesses during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021 from the depths of the pandemic that we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. 

We expect medical procedure recovery rates to continue to vary by therapy and country and could be impacted by regional COVID-19 case volumes, vaccine immunization rates, and new COVID-19 variants. As a result, we cannot predict with confidence the duration of the pandemic or the impact it may have on our Company.

(9)The charges primarily include costs incurred in connection with legacy-Covidien enterprise resource planning deployment activities, business combination related costs, and changes in fair value of contingent consideration.

(10)The charges, which include $413 million recognized in interest expense and ($7 million) recognized in other operating expense, net, primarily relates to the early redemption of approximately $5.2 billion of debt.

(11)The net charges relate to the exit of businesses and are primarily comprised of intangible asset impairments.

(12)The net benefit primarily relates to the release of a valuation allowance on certain net operating losses, the impact of an intercompany sale of intellectual property, and the impact of tax reform in Switzerland and the United States.

Free Cash Flow 

Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is calculated by subtracting additions to property, plant, and equipment from net cash provided by operating activities. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures, to evaluate our operating results. Free cash flow should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations between net cash provided by operating activities (the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure) and free cash flow are as follows:

Segment and Market Geography

The charts below illustrate the percent of net sales by market geography for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:

The table below includes net sales by market geography for each of our segments for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)U.S. includes the United States and U.S. territories.

(2)Non-U.S. developed markets include Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Korea, Canada, and the countries within Western Europe.

(3)Emerging markets include the countries of the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and the countries of Asia that are not included in the non-U.S. developed markets, as defined above.

The increase in net sales for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily related to the recovery of procedure volumes as compared to the drastic decline experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the pandemic. While the recovery of procedural volumes has been uneven across geographies and our different product lines, as of the end of fiscal year 2021, procedural volumes in the majority of our end markets are returning to pre-pandemic levels. Net sales for fiscal year 2021 were also impacted by an additional selling week during the first fiscal month of fiscal year 2021 due to our 52/53 week fiscal year calendar. Although we cannot precisely calculate the impact of the extra selling week, we estimate that it benefited net sales for fiscal year 2021 by approximately $360 million to $390 million. Additionally, currency had a favorable impact on net sales in non-U.S. developed markets of $427 million and an unfavorable impact on net sales in emerging markets of $98 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. 

During the first and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2021, we realigned our divisions with Neuroscience and Cardiovascular, respectively. As a result, fiscal year 2020 results have been recast to adjust for these realignments. Additionally, we implemented our new operating model in fiscal year 2021, which was fully operational beginning in the fourth quarter. Our new operating model simplifies our organization in order to accelerate decision making, improve commercial execution, and more effectively leverage the scale of our company. The "Restructuring Charges, Net" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis has further information regarding our new operating model. 

36
Looking ahead, the uncertain and uneven global recovery from COVID-19 and the resulting impact on future procedural volumes and demand for our products and therapies could negatively impact our business. Additionally, our segments are likely to face competitive product launches and pricing pressure, geographic macro-economic risks, reimbursement challenges, impacts from changes in the mix of our product offerings, changes in timing of product registration approvals, replacement cycle challenges, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 

Cardiovascular 

Cardiovascular products include pacemakers, insertable cardiac monitors, cardiac resynchronization therapy devices (CRT-D & CRT-P), implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD), leads and delivery systems, ventricular assist systems, ablation products, electrophysiology catheters, products for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, information systems for the management of patients with Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure devices, products designed to reduce surgical site infections, coronary and peripheral stents and related delivery systems, balloons and related delivery systems, endovascular stent graft systems, heart valve replacement technologies, cardiac tissue ablation systems, and open heart and coronary bypass grafting surgical products. Cardiovascular also includes Care Management Services and Cath Lab Managed Services (CLMS) within the Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure division. Cardiovascular net sales for fiscal year 2021 were $10.8 billion, an increase of 3 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2021 of $131 million. Cardiovascular net sales increase for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, was primarily due to the recovery of global procedural volumes from the downturn experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 resulting from the pandemic. 

The charts below illustrate the percent of Cardiovascular net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020: 

Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure (CRHF) net sales increased 9 percent in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The increase was led by Cardiac Rhythm Management and Cardiac Ablation Solutions products, which included strong growth from the Micra leadless pacing system, Cobalt and Crome ICDs and CRT-Ds, TYRX antibacterial envelope, and Artic Front Advance Cryoballons. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in Mechanical Circulatory Support products driven by slower recovery of procedure volumes and competitive dynamics. 

Structural Heart & Aortic (SHA) net sales were flat in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 as growth in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) nets sales were offset by net sales declines within our Aortic and Cardiac Surgery businesses. The growth experienced in TAVR was driven by continued adoption of the Evolut Pro + valve. The declines experienced in Aortic and Cardiac Surgery were a result of slower recovery of procedure volumes as well our voluntary recall of the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. 

Coronary & Peripheral Vascular (CPV) net sales decreased 5 percent in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020. The decline was a result of the generally more deferrable nature of peripheral and endovenous procedure categories as well as the negative impact of the Chinese national tender on our drug-eluting stent sales. The Chinese national tender went into effect in January 2021 and resulted in significant price declines for drug-eluting stents in China, which negatively impacted our Coronary business. Partially offsetting these negative impacts was growth in drug-coated balloons and peripheral embolization 

37
coils. Drug-coated balloon growth was the result of strong adoption of the IN.PACT AV drug-coated balloon driven by its pivotal data published during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021. 

In addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead, we expect Cardiovascular could be affected by the following:

•Continued growth of our Micra transcatheter pacing system. Micra AV received U.S. FDA approval and CE Mark approval in January and April 2020, respectfully. Micra AV expands the Micra target population from 15 percent to 45 percent of pacemaker patients. 

•Continued acceptance and growth from the Azure XT and S SureScan pacing systems. Azure pacemakers feature Medtronic-exclusive BlueSync technology, which enables automatic, secure wireless remote monitoring with increased device longevity.

•Acceptance and growth of the Cobalt and Crome portfolio of ICDs and CRT-Ds. These devices received CE Mark approval during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and U.S. FDA approval during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.

•Continued acceptance and growth of the Claria MRI CRT-D system with EffectivCRT Diagnostic and Effective CRT during AF algorithm.

•Acceptance and growth of the LINQ II cardiac monitor, which received CE Mark in November 2019 and gained U.S. FDA approval during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. As of the end of the fiscal year 2021, we are experiencing supply constrains for the LINQ II cardiac monitor as we ramp our wafer scale manufacturing. 

•Continued acceptance and growth of the CRT-P quadripolar pacing system.

•Continued growth, adoption, and utilization of the TYRX Envelope for implantable devices driven by the favorable results of the WRAP-IT clinical study. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, we received 12-month shelf life extension for our TYRX Envelope product.

•Continued acceptance and market expansion of the Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon for treatment of atrial fibrillation. We are pursuing a first line therapy designation from the U.S. FDA for the Arctic Front Advance Cryoballoon's treatment of atrial fibrillation using the data of the STOP AF First clinical trial. 

•Continued acceptance and growth of the self-expanding CoreValve Evolut transcatheter aortic valve replacement platform into intermediate risk indication globally and for the treatment of patients determined to be at low risk with surgery. The Platform received both CE Mark for low risk and bicuspid labeling indication in Europe during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. In August 2020, the U.S. FDA approved revised commercial labeling for the platform that modified a precaution for the treatment of patients at low risk.

•Continued expansion and training of field support to increase coverage in the U.S. centers performing transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedures. 

•Continued acceptance and growth from Evolut PRO, which provides industry-leading hemodynamics, reliable delivery, and advanced sealing with an excellent safety profile, as well as acceptance of our next generation Evolut Pro Plus TAVR valve. 

•The negative impact of the Chinese national tender on drug-eluting stent prices in China, that went into effect in January 2021, as well as provincial tenders in China on other Coronary product categories. 

•Continued acceptance and growth from the VenaSeal Closure System in the U.S. The VenaSeal Closure System is a unique non-thermal solution to address superficial venous disease that provides improved patient comfort, reduces the recovery time, and eliminates the risk of thermal nerve injury.

•Our voluntary recall of the Valiant Navion Thoracic Stent Graft System and our ability to ramp production of our previous generation product, the Valiant Captivia Thoracic Stent Graft System and resume selling this product in markets globally. We currently have limited Valiant Captivia inventory available and plan to reach full production capacity in October 2021.

38
•Our recent decision to stop the distribution and sale of the Medtronic HVAD System in June 2021 in light of a growing body of observational clinical comparisons indicating a lower frequency of neurological adverse events and mortality with another circulatory support device available to patients compared to the HVAD system. The HVAD system and associated accessory revenue was $141 million in fiscal year 2021. Medtronic is committed to serving the needs of the approximately 4,000 patients currently implanted with our HVAD system. We expect to record a non-cash, pre-tax impairment of long-lived assets of $400 million to $500 million in the quarter ending July 30, 2021 primarily related to intangible assets. Management also expects to record a charge related to customer support obligations, restructuring, and other associated costs in the quarter ending July 30, 2021.

•Our ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of products within our pipeline, which include the Symplicity Spyral Multi-Electrode Renal Denervation Catheter for the treatment of hypertension through a one-time, minimally invasive, catheter procedure, Pulse Field Ablation, a novel energy source that is non-thermal, for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, and transcatheter mitral and tricuspid therapy products lead by our Intrepid system. 

Medical Surgical 

Medical Surgical’s products span the entire continuum of patient care from diagnosis to recovery, with a focus on diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, pelvic region, kidneys, obesity, and preventable complications. The products include those for advanced and general surgical products, surgical stapling devices, vessel sealing instruments, wound closure, electrosurgery products, hernia mechanical devices, mesh implants, advanced ablation, interventional lung, ventilators, airway products, renal care products, and sensors and monitors for pulse oximetry, capnography, level of consciousness and cerebral oximetry. Medical Surgical’s net sales for fiscal year 2021 were $8.7 billion, an increase of 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales of $87 million for fiscal year 2021. Net sales growth was primarily driven by the recovery in procedure volumes experienced from the downturn experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 from the pandemic and increased demand for COVID-19 related diagnostics and therapies, particularly ventilator and airway products, as compared to fiscal year 2020.

The charts below illustrate the percent of Medical Surgical net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:

Surgical Innovations (SI) net sales for fiscal year 2021 decreased 1 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020, with declines experienced across many product lines due to the deceleration of surgical procedure recovery. The decline in surgical volumes, particularly Bariatric, Colorectal, Hernia, and Thoracic procedures, resulted in lower demand for Advanced Stapling products and General Surgery products. This decline in demand was partially offset by new product launches driving growth in Advanced Energy. 

39
Respiratory, Gastrointestinal, & Renal (RGR) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 16 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Net sales growth was primarily attributable to increased demand for Respiratory Interventions products due to COVID-19, driven by the Puritan Bennett high acuity ventilator portfolio.

In addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Medical Surgical could be affected by the following:

•Continued acceptance and future growth of Open-to-MIS techniques and tools supported by our efforts to transition open surgery to MIS (minimally invasive surgery). The Open-to-MIS initiative focuses on furthering our presence in and working to optimize open surgery globally, while capturing the market opportunity that exists in transitioning open procedures to MIS, whether through traditional MIS, or advanced technologies including robotics. 

•Continued acceptance and future growth of powered stapling and energy platform, along with our ability to execute ongoing strategies to develop, gain regulatory approval, and commercialize new products including our surgical soft tissue robotics platform. 

•Our ability to execute ongoing strategies in order to address the competitive pressure of reprocessing of our vessel sealing disposables and growth of surgical soft tissue robotics procedures in the U.S.

•Our ability to create markets and drive products and procedures into emerging markets. We have high quality and cost-effective surgical products designed for customers in emerging markets such as the ValleyLab LS10 single channel vessel sealing generator, which is compatible with our line of LigaSure instruments and designed for simplified use and affordability. 

•Continued acceptance and growth within the end stage renal disease market. The population of patients treated for end stage renal disease globally is expected to double over the next decade. 

•Continued elevation of the standard of care for respiratory compromise, a progressive condition impacting a patient’s ability to breathe effectively, which leverages our market leading MicroStream capnography technology. 

•Continued acceptance and growth in patient monitoring, airway, and ventilation management. Key products in this area include the Puritan Bennett 980 ventilator, Microstream Capnography, Nellcor pulse oximetry system with OxiMax technology, Shiley tracheostomy and endotracheal tubes, and McGRATH MAC video laryngoscopes.

•Continued and future acceptance of less invasive standards of care in Gastrointestinal and Hepatology products, including the areas of GI Diagnostic and Therapeutic product lines. Recently launched products include the PillCam COLON capsule endoscopy, the Barrx platform through ablation with the Barrx 360 Express catheter, EndoFLIP imaging systems, Bravo Calibration-free reflux testing, and the Emprint ablation system with Thermosphere Technology, which maintains predictable spherical ablation zones throughout procedures reducing procedure time and cost.

•Continued and future acceptance of Interventional Lung Solutions. Products include our Illumisite navigation platform, combined with our portfolio of biopsy tools including the Arcpoint pulmonary needle, and to access lesions outside the airway, the CrossCountry transbronchial access tool. This comprehensive portfolio gives the power to display position and access lung nodules in the periphery of the lungs, in a minimally invasive approach to accessing difficult-to-reach areas of the lung, which may aid in the diagnosis of lung cancer.

•Expanding the use of less invasive treatments and furthering our commitment to improving options for women with abnormal uterine bleeding. Our expanded and strengthened surgical offerings are expected to complement our global gynecology business.

•Our ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of products within our pipeline, which include our PillCam Genius endoscopy module, a noninvasive process to localize pre-cancerous lesions and our Hugo robotic assisted surgery system, designed to help reduce unwanted variability, improve patient outcomes, and, by extension, lower per-procedure cost.

40
Neuroscience

Neuroscience's products include various spinal implants, bone graft substitutes, biologic products, image-guided surgery and intra-operative imaging systems, robotic guidance systems used in the robot-assisted spine procedures, and systems that incorporate advanced energy surgical instruments. Neuroscience's products also focus on the treatment of overactive bladder, urinary retention, fecal incontinence, gastroparesis, as well as products to treat ear, nose, and throat (ENT), and therapies to treat the diseases of the vasculature in and around the brain, including coils, neurovascular stents and flow diversion products. Neuroscience also manufactures products related to implantable neurostimulation therapies and drug delivery systems for the treatment of chronic pain, movement disorders, and epilepsy. Neuroscience’s net sales for fiscal year 2021 were $8.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2021 of $75 million. Neuroscience’s net sales growth was observed across all divisions and reflected the recovery of global procedural volumes, particularly on deferrable procedures, from the downturn experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 as a result of the pandemic.

The graphs below illustrate the percent of Neuroscience net sales by division for fiscal years 2021 and 2020:

Cranial & Spinal Technologies (CST) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 5 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Growth was experienced by both Enabling Technologies and Spine. Enabling Technologies results, though still impacted by the challenging environment for capital equipment due to COVID-19, were driven by recovery on sales of the Midas Rex MR8 high-speed drill system and the StealthStation S8 Navigation System. Spine net sales growth was driven by recovery in procedural volumes in fiscal year 2021.

Specialty Therapies (Specialty) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Net sales growth was primarily driven by strength in Pelvic Health and Neurovascular. Pelvic Health saw continued recovery and growth throughout the fiscal year, driven by the launch of the InterStim Micro neurostimulator and SureScan MRI lead in the U.S. Neurovascular's growth continued to be driven by strength in coils and aspiration catheters, as well as general strength in emerging markets. This growth was partially offset by declines in flow diversion products due to recent competitive entrants. ENT experienced modest net sales growth due to the recovery of deferrable procedure volumes.

Neuromodulation (NM) net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased 7 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Sales growth occurred in both Pain Therapies and Brain Modulation and reflected a recovery in procedural volumes. Net sales growth was driven by strong adoption of the DTM (differential target multiplexed) proprietary waveform in Pain Therapies, and the Percept PC deep brain stimulation (DBS) device with BrainSense technology in Brain Modulation.

41
In addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Neuroscience could be affected by the following:

•Continued growth from Enabling Technologies StealthStation and O-Arm Imaging Systems, Midas, and ENT Navigation and Power Systems, as well as acceptance of the Stealth Autoguide cranial robotic guidance platform.

•Continued sales of Mazor robotic units and associated market adoption of robot-assisted spine procedures, including the Mazor X Stealth, our integrated robotics and navigation platform.

•Strengthening of our position in the spine titanium interbody implant marketplace as a result of the June 2019 acquisition of Titan Spine.

•Continued adoption of our integrated solutions through the Surgical Synergy strategy, which integrates our spinal implants with enabling technologies such as imaging, navigation, power instruments, nerve monitoring, and Mazor robotics.

•Market acceptance and continued global adoption of innovative new spine products and procedural solutions within our CST business such as our Infinity OCT System and Prestige LP cervical disc system.

•Growth in the broader vertebral compression fracture (VCF) and adjacent markets as we continue to pursue the development of other therapies to treat more patients with VCF, including continued success of both the Kyphon V vertebroplasty system and the Osteocool RF Spinal Tumor ablation system.

•Continued acceptance and growth of our ENT and Pelvic Health therapies within our Specialty Therapies division, including our InterStim therapy with InterStim II and InterStim Micro neurostimulators, which received CE mark approval in January 2020 and U.S. FDA approval in August 2020, for the treatment of the symptoms of overactive bladder, urinary retention, and bowel incontinence, and capital equipment sales of the Stealth Station ENT surgical navigation system and intraoperative NIM nerve monitoring system.

•Continued acceptance and growth of the Solitaire FR revascularization device for treatment of acute ischemic stroke and the Pipeline Embolization Devices, endovascular treatments for large or giant wide-necked brain aneurysms.

•Continued acceptance of our React Catheter and Riptide aspiration system, along with our next-generation Solitaire revascularization device.

•Market acceptance and continued global adoption of our Intellis spinal cord stimulator, DTM proprietary waveform, Evolve workflow algorithm, and Snapshot reporting to treat chronic pain in major markets around the world.

•Continued acceptance and growth of our Percept PC DBS device with BrainSense technology, which received CE Mark approval in January 2020 and U.S. FDA approval in June 2020, including its treatment of Parkinson's Disease, epilepsy, and other movement disorders.

•Ongoing obligations under the U.S. FDA consent decree entered in April 2015 relating to the SynchroMed drug infusion system and the Neuromodulation quality system. The U.S. FDA lifted its distribution requirements on our implantable drug pump in October 2017 and its warning letter in November 2017.

•Our ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of the products within our pipeline, which include our closed-loop Percept PC and RC devices with adaptive DBS (aDBS) within Neuromodulation, as well as our hemorrhagic stroke intrasaccular device within Specialty Therapies, and our next-generation spine enabling technologies within CST.

Diabetes

Diabetes' products include insulin pumps, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems, insulin pump consumables, and smart insulin pen systems. Diabetes' sales for fiscal year 2021 were $2.4 billion, an increase of 2 percent as compared to fiscal year 2020. Currency had a favorable impact on net sales for fiscal year 2021 of $37 million. Diabetes' net sales increases for fiscal year 2021 were primarily attributable to growth in the MiniMed 780G insulin pump system and integrated CGM in the international markets. This growth was partially offset by declines in the U.S. due to new patient start delays and continued competitive pressures. 

42
In addition to the general impacts of COVID-19 on our Company as described in the Executive Level Overview, looking ahead we expect Diabetes could be affected by the following:

•Patient demand for the MiniMed 770G insulin pump system, which received U.S. FDA approval in August 2020 and launched in November 2020. The system is powered by SmartGuard technology, as featured in the MiniMed 670G system, with the added benefits of smartphone connectivity and an expanded age indication to children as young as age two. 

•Continued future growth internationally for the MiniMed 780G system. The MiniMed 780G system was approved in the E.U. in June 2020 and launched in over 30 countries on four continents outside the U.S., primarily in Europe, starting in October 2020. The global adoption of sensor-augmented insulin pump systems has resulted in strong sensor attachment rates. 

•Continued acceptance and growth of the Guardian Connect CGM system, which displays glucose information directly to a smartphone. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we introduced the Guardian Connect system for Android devices to ensure patients have access to their glucose levels seamlessly and discretely. The Guardian Connect CGM system is available on Apple iOS and Android devices. 

•Strengthening our position in the diabetes market as a result of the September 10, 2020 acquisition of Companion Medical. Companion Medical offers a U.S. FDA cleared InPen smart pen system that combines the freedom of a reusable Bluetooth pen with the intelligence of an intuitive mobile application that helps users administer the appropriate insulin dose. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2021, we integrated our CGM data into the Companion Medical InPen Application, which allows users to have their CGM readings in real-time alongside insulin dose information, all in one view. 

•Continued pump and CGM competition in an expanding global market. 

•Changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs, along with additional payor coverage on insulin pumps.

•Our ability to successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval of the products within our pipeline, which include our adult and pediatric MiniMed 780G and the Guardian 4 sensor, which have been submitted to the U.S. FDA. These technologies feature our next-generation algorithms by further automating insulin delivery. 

43
COSTS AND EXPENSES

The following is a summary of cost of products sold, research and development, and selling, general, and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales:

Cost of Products Sold  Cost of products sold for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $10.5 billion and $9.4 billion, respectively. The increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, was largely due to increased expenses as a result of a full fiscal year impact of COVID-19, primarily due to period expensing of some of our fixed overhead costs due to idle capacity at certain manufacturing facilities and increases in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory, as well as charges associated with recent field corrective actions. Going forward, we will continue to focus on reducing our costs of production through supplier management, manufacturing improvements, and optimizing our manufacturing network. 

Research and Development Expense We remain committed to accelerating the development of meaningful innovations to deliver better patient outcomes at appropriate costs that lead to enhanced quality of life and may be validated by clinical and economic evidence. We are also focused on expanding access to quality healthcare. 

In fiscal year 2021, we entered into arrangements with third parties to fund the development of certain technologies in our Diabetes segment. As there is a substantive and genuine transfer of risk to the third parties, the development funding provided is recognized as an obligation to perform contractual services, and therefore is recorded as income in other operating expense, net in the consolidated statements of income in the period the corresponding research and development expenses are incurred. If the technologies receive regulatory approval and are successfully commercialized, we will pay royalties to the third parties. During fiscal year 2021, no projects were significant, either individually or in aggregate, to our consolidated results.

Selling, General, and Administrative Expense  Our goal is to continue to leverage selling, general, and administrative expense initiatives. Selling, general, and administrative expense primarily consists of salaries and wages, other administrative costs, such as professional fees and marketing expenses, and certain acquisition and restructuring expenses.

Selling, general, and administrative expense for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 was $10.1 billion. The decrease in selling, general, and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year 2021, as compared to 2020, was primarily due to net sales growth, coupled with reduced travel and discretionary spending due to the pandemic, offset by higher annual incentive accruals and increased restructuring and associated costs. Selling, general, and administrative expense in fiscal year 2021 includes $196 million of restructuring and associated costs, as compared to $168 million in fiscal year 2020. Additionally, for fiscal year 2020, selling, general, and administrative expense includes $103 million of acquisition-related costs, as compared to $3 million for fiscal year 2021.

Enterprise Excellence

In the third quarter of fiscal year 2018, we announced a multi-year global Enterprise Excellence Program designed to drive long-term business growth and sustainable efficiency. The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to further leverage our global size and scale as well as enhance the customer and employee experience.

The Enterprise Excellence Program is focused on three objectives:

•Global Operations – integrating and enhancing global manufacturing and supply processes, systems and site presence to improve quality, delivery cost and cash flow

•Functional Optimization – enhancing and leveraging global operating models and systems across several enabling functions to improve productivity and employee experience

•Commercial Optimization – optimizing certain processes, systems and models to improve productivity and the customer experience

The Enterprise Excellence Program is designed to drive operating margin improvement as well as fund investment in strategic growth initiatives, with expected gross savings of more than $3.0 billion from cost reductions and leverage of our fixed infrastructure by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately $500 million to $700 million of gross annual savings are expected to be achieved through the end of fiscal year 2022.

The Enterprise Excellence Program is expected to result in pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion, the vast majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022 and result in cash outlays to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2023. Approximately 40 percent of estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries and benefits for employees supporting the program, including program management and transition teams, and strategic and operational consulting services related to the three objectives of the program discussed above. We expect these costs to be recognized within restructuring charges, net, cost of products sold, and selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.

During fiscal year 2021, we recognized net charges of $349 million, including $52 million recognized within restructuring charges, net in the consolidated statements of income which were primarily comprised of employee termination benefits. For fiscal year 2021, charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including $128 million recognized within cost of products sold and $169 million recognized within selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. 

During fiscal year 2020, we recognized net charges of $441 million, including $118 million recognized within restructuring charges, net in the consolidated statements of income primarily comprised of employee termination benefits. For fiscal year 2020, charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including $149 million recognized within cost of products sold and $165 million recognized within selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. 

45
Simplification

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we initiated our Simplification restructuring program, designed to make the Company a more nimble and competitive organization focused on accelerating innovation, enhancing the customer experience, driving revenue growth, and winning market share, while also more efficiently and effectively leveraging our enterprise scale. Under the oversight of the portfolio leaders, this new operating model, which became fully operational the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, will simplify our organizational structure and accelerate decision-making and execution. Primary activities of the restructuring program will include reorganizing our business into a portfolio-level structure, including the creation of highly focused, accountable and empowered Operating Units (OUs), consolidating operations at the enterprise level, establishing Technology Development Centers in areas where we have deep core technology competencies to be leveraged by multiple OUs, and forming dedicated sales organizations that leverage our scale but move with the same agility as our smaller, local competitors.

The Simplification program designed to streamline our operating model, improve competitiveness, and enhance the customer and employee experience will result in substantial reduction in selling, general, and administrative expenses, the majority of which are expected to be achieved through the end of fiscal year 2022. Annual savings of approximately $450 million to $475 million are expected to be realized by the various components of the Simplification program.

We estimate that, in connection with the Simplification restructuring program, we will recognize pre-tax exit and disposal costs and other costs across all segments of approximately $400 million to $450 million, the majority of which are expected to be incurred by the end of fiscal year 2022. Approximately three quarters of the estimated charges are related to employee termination benefits. The remaining charges are costs associated with the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses to execute the reorganization of our business into a portfolio-like structure as discussed above. These charges are recognized within restructuring charges, net and selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income. 

During fiscal year 2021, we recognized net charges of $268 million, including $241 million within restructuring charges, net in the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal year 2021, charges included $97 million of incremental defined benefit pension and post-retirement related expenses for employees that accepted voluntary early retirement packages within restructuring charges, net in the consolidated statements of income. For fiscal year 2021, charges also included costs incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program, such as salaries for employees supporting the program and consulting expenses, including $27 million recognized within selling, general, and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income.

For additional information, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Certain Litigation Charges We classify litigation charges and gains related to significant legal matters as certain litigation charges. For additional information, refer to Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net primarily includes royalty income and expense, currency remeasurement and derivative gains and losses, Puerto Rico excise taxes, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, changes in amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a recent acquisition, a commitment to the Medtronic Foundation, charges associated with business exits, impairment charges, in-process research and development (IPR&D) charges, and income from funded research and development arrangements.

The increase in other operating expense, net from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily driven by our remeasurement and hedging programs, which, combined, resulted in a loss of $47 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to a gain of $295 million for fiscal year 2020. Additionally, for fiscal year 2021, other operating expense, net includes a $132 million gain related to amounts accrued for certain contingent liabilities for a recent acquisition and impairment charges of $76 million related to the abandonment of certain intangible assets. Also contributing to the increase were changes in fair value of contingent consideration resulting in a loss of $36 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to a gain of $33 million for fiscal year 2020. For fiscal year 2020, other operating expense, net includes an $80 million charge associated with a commitment to the Medtronic Foundation and charges of $52 million associated with the exit of businesses. 

Other Non-Operating Income, Net Other non-operating income, net includes the non-service components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost, investment gains and losses, and interest income. 

The decrease in other non-operating income, net from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest income as a result of the lower interest rate environment. Interest income was $192 million and $300 million for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in gains recognized on minority investments. Gains on minority investments were $61 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to losses of $19 million for fiscal year 2020. 

46
Interest Expense Interest expense includes interest incurred on our outstanding borrowings, amortization of debt issuance costs and debt premiums or discounts, amortization of gains or losses on terminated or de-designated interest rate derivative instruments, and charges recognized in connection with the tender and early redemption of senior notes. The decrease in interest expense from fiscal year 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in charges related to debt tender and redemption transactions, which were $308 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $413 million for fiscal year 2020. Also contributing to the decrease was a decrease in the weighted-average interest rate of outstanding debt obligations due to the aforementioned debt issuance and tender transactions. Refer to the "Debt and Capital" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information on the debt issuances, tenders, and early redemptions.

INCOME TAXES

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Many of the countries we operate in have statutory tax rates lower than our U.S. statutory rate, thereby resulting in an overall effective tax rate less than the U.S. statutory rate of 21.0 percent. A significant portion of our earnings are generated from operations in Puerto Rico, Switzerland, and Ireland. The statutory tax rates for these jurisdictions range from 12.5 percent to 43.75 percent. Our earnings in Puerto Rico are subject to certain tax incentive grants which provide for tax rates lower than the country’s statutory tax rates. Unless our tax incentive grants are extended, they will expire between fiscal years 2022 and 2030. The tax incentive grants, which expired during fiscal year 2021, did not have a material impact on our financial results. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.

Our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was 6.8 percent, as compared to (18.5) percent in fiscal year 2020. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the impacts from certain tax adjustments and year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.

Our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2021 was 11.8 percent, as compared to 14.3 percent in fiscal year 2020. The decrease in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to the year-over-year changes in operational results by jurisdiction.

During fiscal year 2021, we recognized $51 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $46 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and a $5 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, legal entity reorganizations, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.

During fiscal year 2020, we recognized $138 million of operational tax benefits. The operational tax benefits included a $63 million benefit from excess tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation and a $75 million net benefit associated with the resolution of certain income tax audits, finalization of certain tax returns, changes to uncertain tax position reserves, and changes to certain deferred income tax balances.

An increase in our Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate of one percent would result in an additional income tax provision for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 of approximately $68 million and $73 million, respectively.

47
Certain Tax Adjustments

During fiscal year 2021, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $41 million, recognized in income tax provision (benefit) in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:

•A net benefit of $106 million associated with the resolution of an audit at the IRS Appellate level for fiscal years 2012, 2013, and 2014. The issues resolved relate to the utilization of certain net operating losses and the allocation of income between Medtronic, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary operating in Puerto Rico for businesses that are not the subject of the U.S. Tax Court Case for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. 

•A net cost of $73 million related to a tax basis adjustment of previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions. The cumulative amount of deferred tax benefit previously recognized from intercompany intellectual property transactions and recorded as Certain Tax Adjustments is $1.5 billion. The corresponding deferred tax assets will be amortized over a period of approximately 20 years. 

•A cost of $50 million associated with the amortization of the previously established deferred tax assets from intercompany intellectual property transactions. 

•A net cost of $25 million associated with an internal restructuring and intercompany sale of assets. 

•A benefit of $83 million related to the capitalization of certain research and development costs for U.S. income tax purposes and the establishment of a deferred tax asset at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate. 

During fiscal year 2020, the net benefit from certain tax adjustments of $1.2 billion, recognized in income tax provision (benefit) in the consolidated statement of income, included the following:

•A net benefit of $63 million related to the finalization of certain state tax impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, and the issuance of certain final U.S. Treasury Regulations associated with U.S. Tax Reform. The primary impact of these regulations resulted in the Company re-establishing its permanently reinvested assertion on certain foreign earnings and reversing the previously accrued tax liability. This benefit was partially offset by additional tax associated with a previously executed internal reorganization of certain foreign subsidiaries.

•A benefit of $252 million related to tax legislative changes in Switzerland, which abolished certain preferential tax regimes the Company benefited from and replaced them with a new set of internationally accepted measures. The legislation provided for higher effective tax rates but allowed for a transitional period whereby an amortizable asset was created for Swiss federal income tax purposes that will be amortized and deducted over a 10-year period.

•A benefit of $658 million related to the release of a valuation allowance previously recorded against certain net operating losses. Luxembourg enacted tax legislation during the year requiring the company to reassess the realizability of certain net operating losses. The Company evaluated both the positive and negative evidence and released valuation allowance equal to the expected benefit from the utilization of certain net operating losses in connection with a planned intercompany sale of intellectual property.

•A net benefit of $269 million associated with the intercompany sale of intellectual property and the establishment of a deferred tax asset. 

Certain tax adjustments will affect the comparability of our operating results between periods. Therefore, we consider these Non-GAAP Adjustments. Refer to the "Executive Level Overview" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis for further discussion of these adjustments.

48
LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We are currently in a strong financial position, despite the impact COVID-19 had on our business and financial results during fiscal years 2021 and 2020. We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, and current investments, along with our credit facility and related commercial paper programs will satisfy our foreseeable operating needs.

Our liquidity and capital structure are evaluated regularly within the context of our annual operating and strategic planning processes. We consider the liquidity necessary to fund our operations, which includes working capital needs, investments in research and development, property, plant, and equipment, and other operating costs. We also consider capital allocation alternatives that balance returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, satisfying maturing debt, and acquiring businesses and technology.

Summary of Cash Flows

The following is a summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities, the effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents, and the net change in cash and cash equivalents:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Activities The $994 million decrease in net cash provided was primarily driven by a decrease in cash collected from customers and an increase in cash paid for income taxes, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid to employees, a decrease in payments made for employer taxes, and a decrease in retirement benefit plan contributions. The decrease in cash collected from customers was primarily related to COVID-19 driving decreased sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020 and first quarter of fiscal year 2021, when compared to the prior fiscal year. The increase in cash paid for income taxes was primarily due to increased estimated federal tax payments and tax payments associated with IRS audit settlements in fiscal year 2021. Cash paid to employees decreased due to lower annual incentive plan payouts compared the prior fiscal year. Payments made for employer taxes decreased due to the deferral of payment on the Company's share of Social Security taxes allowed by the CARES Act in the current fiscal year. For information on retirement benefit plan contributions, refer to Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Investing Activities The $337 million decrease in net cash used was primarily attributable to a decrease in net purchases of investments of $1.0 billion, partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $506 million as compared to fiscal year 2020.

Financing Activities The $62 million decrease in net cash used included a number of largely offsetting items. Contributing to the decrease in cash used was a decrease in share repurchases of $674 million. Partially offsetting this decrease was a net decrease in short-term borrowings of $294 million and an increase in dividends paid to shareholders of $226 million. For fiscal year 2021, financing cash flows were impacted by the Mizuho Bank term loan under which we borrowed ¥300 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, which was subsequently repaid in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. Fiscal year 2021 financing cash flows were also impacted by the issuance of $7.2 billion of Euro-denominated senior notes offset by the early redemption of $6.0 billion of senior notes for $6.3 billion of total consideration, and repayment of an additional $911 million of Euro-denominated senior notes. For comparison, financing cash flows for fiscal year 2020 reflect the issuance of $5.6 billion of Euro-denominated senior notes, offset by the tender of $5.2 billion of senior notes for $5.6 billion of total consideration. We also repaid $500 million of senior notes at maturity during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020. For more information on the aforementioned Mizuho Bank term loan, and issuances and redemptions of senior notes, refer to the Debt and Capital section.

Debt and Capital

Our capital structure consists of equity and interest-bearing debt. We primarily utilize unsecured senior debt obligations to meet our financing needs and, to a lesser extent, bank borrowings. From time to time, we may repurchase our outstanding debt obligations in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. 

49
Total debt at April 30, 2021 was $26.4 billion, as compared to $24.8 billion at April 24, 2020. The increase in total debt was primarily driven by fluctuations in exchange rates as it pertains to our Euro-denominated senior notes and, to a lesser extent, the net impact of the issuance and redemption of senior notes, both of which are described below.

In September 2020, we issued six tranches of Euro-denominated senior notes with an aggregate principal of €6.3 billion, with maturities ranging from fiscal year 2023 to fiscal year 2051, resulting in cash proceeds of approximately $7.2 billion, net of discounts and issuance costs. The Euro-denominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our European operations. We used the net proceeds of the offering to fund the early redemption of $6.0 billion of senior notes for $6.3 billion of total consideration in October 2020. Additionally, we used the proceeds to repay our €750 million floating rate senior notes at maturity in March 2021. We recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $308 million in fiscal year 2021, which primarily included cash premiums and accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts and premiums. The loss on debt extinguishment was recognized in interest expense in the consolidated statements of income.

In May 2020, we entered into an unsecured term loan agreement with Mizuho Bank, Ltd. for an aggregate principal amount of up to ¥300 billion, or approximately $2.8 billion, with a term of six months and the option to extend for an additional six months. On May 13, 2020, Medtronic Luxco borrowed the entire amount of the term loan under the Loan Agreement. The proceeds of the loan were used for general corporate purposes. The Japanese Yen denominated debt was designated as a net investment hedge of certain of our Japanese operations. On November 12, 2020, we exercised our option to extend the term of the loan for an additional six months. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we de-designated the Yen denominated debt as a net investment hedge and repaid the term loan in full, including interest. 

We repurchase our ordinary shares from time to time as part of our focus on returning value to our shareholders. In March 2019, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of $6.0 billion of the Company's ordinary shares. There is no specific time period associated with these repurchase authorizations. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we repurchased a total of 4 million and 12 million shares, respectively, under these programs at an average price of $126.80 and $106.22, respectively. At April 30, 2021, we had approximately $5.4 billion remaining under the share repurchase programs authorized by our Board of Directors. 

For more information on credit arrangements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Liquidity

Our liquidity sources at April 30, 2021 include $3.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $7.2 billion of current investments.

Additionally, we maintain commercial paper programs (no commercial paper outstanding at April 30, 2021) and a Credit Facility.

Our investments primarily include available-for-sale debt securities, including U.S. and non-U.S. government and agency securities, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and other asset-backed securities. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our investments. 

We maintain multicurrency commercial paper programs for short-term financing, which allows us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes on a private placement basis up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.5 billion. At both April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, we had no commercial paper outstanding. The issuance of commercial paper reduces the amount of credit available under our existing line of credit, as explained below.

We also have a $3.5 billion five-year syndicated credit facility (Credit Facility), which expires in December 2025. The Credit Facility provides backup funding for the commercial paper programs and may also be used for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility provides us with the ability to increase our borrowing capacity by an additional $1.0 billion at any time during the term of the agreement. At each anniversary date of the Credit Facility, but not more than twice prior to the maturity date, we could also request a one-year extension of the maturity date. At April 30, 2021 and April 24, 2020, no amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility.

Interest rates on advances of our Credit Facility are determined by a pricing matrix based on our long-term debt ratings assigned by Standard & Poor's Rating Services (S&P) and Moody's Investor Service (Moody’s). Facility fees are payable on the Credit Facility and are determined in the same manner as the interest rates. We are in compliance with all covenants related to the Credit Facility.

50
The following table is a summary of our S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1) Agency ratings are subject to change, and there is no assurance that an agency will continue to provide ratings and/or maintain its current ratings. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the rating agency, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

S&P and Moody's long-term debt ratings and short-term debt ratings at April 30, 2021 were unchanged as compared to the ratings at April 24, 2020. We do not expect the S&P and Moody's ratings to have a significant impact on our liquidity or future flexibility to access additional liquidity given our balance sheet, Credit Facility, and related commercial paper programs.

51
Contractual Obligations and Cash Requirements 

We have future contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments that are entered into in the normal course of business, some of which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet. We believe our off-balance sheet arrangements do not have a material current or anticipated future effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows. 

Presented below is a summary of our off-balance sheet contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments at April 30, 2021, as well as long-term contractual obligations reflected in the balance sheet at April 30, 2021.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes commitments related to the funding of minority investments, estimated milestone payments, and royalty obligations. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in the table reflect our best estimates. 

(2)Includes the contractual interest payments on our outstanding debt and excludes the impacts of debt premium and discount amortization. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements.

(3)Includes inventory purchase commitments, research and development, and other arrangements that are legally binding and specify minimum purchase quantities or spending amounts. These purchase commitments do not exceed our projected requirements and are in the normal course of business. Excludes open purchase orders with a remaining term of less than one year.

(4)Excludes defined benefit plan obligations, guarantee obligations, uncertain tax positions, non-current tax liabilities, and litigation settlements for which we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement. For further information, see Notes 13, 15, and 18 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

(5)Includes the current and non-current portion of our Senior Notes and bank borrowings. Excludes debt premium and discount, unamortized gains from terminated interest rate swap agreements, and commercial paper. See Notes 6 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our debt agreements and interest rate swap agreements, respectively.

(6)Includes the fair value of our current and non-current portions of contingent consideration. While it is not certain if and/or when payments will be made, the maturity dates included in this table reflect our best estimates. 

(7)Represents the tax obligations associated with the transition tax that resulted from U.S. Tax Reform. The transition tax will be paid over an eight-year period and will not accrue interest. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that require us to indemnify customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising as a result of our products or the negligence of our personnel or claims alleging that our products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. Our maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions is unable to be estimated, and we have not accrued any liabilities within our consolidated financial statements or included any indemnification provisions in the table above. Historically, we have not experienced significant losses on these types of indemnification agreements. 

52
Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K provides information regarding amounts we have accrued related to legal matters. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Actual settlements may be different than estimated and could have a material effect on our consolidated earnings, financial position, and/or cash flows.

We record tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements for amounts that we expect to repatriate from subsidiaries (to the extent the repatriation would be subject to tax); however, no tax liabilities are recorded for amounts we consider to be permanently reinvested. We expect to have access to the majority of our cash flows in the future. In addition, we continue to evaluate our legal entity structure supporting our business operations, and to the extent such evaluation results in a change to our overall business structure, we may be required to accrue for additional tax obligations.

Beyond the contractual obligations and other minimum commercial commitments outlined above, we have recurring cash requirements arising from the normal operation of our business that include capital expenditures, research and developments costs, and other operational costs. 

We believe our balance sheet and liquidity provide us with flexibility, and our cash, cash equivalents, current investments, Credit Facility and related commercial paper programs as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our current and future contractual obligations and cash requirements. We regularly review our capital needs and consider various investing and financing alternatives to support our requirements.

ACQUISITIONS

Information regarding acquisitions is included in Notes 3 to the consolidated financial statements in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

We have used various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

The preparation of the consolidated financial statements, in conformity with U.S. GAAP, requires us to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates reflect our best judgment about economic and market conditions and the potential effects on the valuation and/or carrying value of assets and liabilities based upon relevant information available. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. 

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Litigation Contingencies We are involved in a number of legal actions involving product liability, intellectual property and commercial disputes, shareholder related matters, environmental proceedings, tax disputes, and governmental proceedings and investigations. The outcomes of these legal actions are not completely within our control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time. In some actions, the enforcement agencies or private claimants seek damages, as well as other civil or criminal remedies (including injunctions barring the sale of products that are the subject of the proceeding), that could require significant expenditures or result in lost revenues or limit our ability to conduct business in the applicable jurisdictions. Estimating probable losses from our litigation and governmental proceedings is inherently difficult, particularly when the matters are in early procedural stages, with incomplete scientific facts or legal discovery; involve unsubstantiated or indeterminate claims for damages; potentially involve penalties, fines, or punitive damages; or could result in a change in business practice. Our significant legal proceedings are discussed in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Income Tax Reserves  We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may or may not prevail. Under U.S. GAAP, if we determine that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the benefit. We measure the benefit by determining the amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We presume that all tax positions will be examined by a taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations. We regularly monitor our tax positions and tax liabilities. We reevaluate the technical merits of our tax positions and recognize an uncertain tax benefit, or derecognize a previously recorded tax benefit, when there is (i) a completion of a tax audit, (ii) effective settlement of an issue, (iii) a change 

53
in applicable tax law including a tax case or legislative guidance, or (iv) the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Significant judgment is required in accounting for tax reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, consolidated earnings, financial position and/or cash flows.

Valuation of Intangible Assets and Goodwill When we acquire a business, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets primarily include patents, trademarks, tradenames, customer relationships, purchased technology, and IPR&D. Determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination requires us to make significant estimates. These estimates include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows of each project or technology, the discount rate used to discount those cash flows to present value, the assessment of the asset’s life cycle, and the consideration of legal, technical, regulatory, economic, and competitive risks.

The test for goodwill impairment requires us to make several estimates to determine fair value, most of which are based on projected future cash flows. Our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment test are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value. We assess the impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level annually as of the first day of the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired.

We test definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount of the assets or asset group may be impaired. Our tests are based on future cash flows that require significant judgment with respect to future revenue and expense growth rates, appropriate discount rates, asset groupings, and other assumptions and estimates. We use estimates that are consistent with the highest and best use of the assets based on a market participant's view of the assets being evaluated. Actual results may differ from our estimates due to a number of factors including, among others, changes in competitive conditions, timing of regulatory approval, results of clinical trials, changes in worldwide economic conditions, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. 

We assess the impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets annually in the third quarter and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. Our impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets require us to make several estimates to determine fair value, including projected future cash flows and discount rates.
