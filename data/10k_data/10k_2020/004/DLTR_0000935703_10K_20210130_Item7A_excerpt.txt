Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

We are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of our business, including the impact of interest rate changes and diesel fuel cost changes. We may enter into interest rate or diesel fuel swaps to manage exposure to interest rate and diesel fuel price changes. We do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not hold derivative instruments for trading purposes.

Interest Rate Risk

Our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our revolving credit facility, as borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR, reset periodically, plus 1.00% to 1.50% as determined by our credit ratings and leverage ratio. At January 30, 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility.
