PART I 

Forward Looking Statements  

Our disclosure and analysis in this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Host Inc.’s 2020 Annual Report to Stockholders contain some forward-looking statements that set forth anticipated results based on management’s plans and assumptions. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. We have tried, wherever possible, to identify each such statement by using words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “will,” “target,” “forecast” and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these forward-looking statements include those relating to future actions, future acquisitions or dispositions, future capital expenditures plans, future performance or results of current and anticipated expenses, interest rates, foreign exchange rates or the outcome of contingencies, such as legal proceedings.  

We cannot guarantee that any future results discussed in any forward-looking statements will be realized, although we believe that we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions. Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and potentially inaccurate assumptions, including those discussed in Item 1A “Risk Factors.” Should known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ materially from past results and those results anticipated, estimated or projected. You should bear this in mind as you consider forward-looking statements.  

We undertake no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any additional disclosures we make or related subjects in our reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Also note that, in our risk factors, we provide a cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possibly inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that, individually or in the aggregate, we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from past results and those results anticipated, estimated or projected. We note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such risk factors. Consequently, you should not consider the discussion of risk factors to be a complete discussion of all the potential risks or uncertainties that could affect our business.  

Item 1.  

Business  

We are the largest publicly traded lodging REIT, with a geographically diverse portfolio of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, our consolidated lodging portfolio consists of 80 primarily luxury and upper-upscale hotels containing approximately 46,300 rooms, with the majority located in the United States, and with five of the hotels located outside of the U.S. in Brazil and Canada. In addition, we own non-controlling interests in five domestic and one international joint venture that own hotels and in a timeshare joint venture in Hawaii.  

Host Inc. was incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1998 and operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT. Host Inc. owns properties and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of the partnership interests (“OP units”) as of December 31, 2020. The remaining partnership interests are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.  

Business Strategy  

Our goal is to be the preeminent owner of high-quality lodging real estate in growing markets in the U.S. and to generate superior long-term risk adjusted returns for our stockholders throughout all phases of the lodging cycle through a combination of appreciation in asset values, growth in earnings and dividend distributions. The pillars of our strategy to achieve this objective include: 

•  

Geographically diverse portfolio of hotels in the U.S. - Own a diversified portfolio of hotels in the U.S. in major urban and resort destinations. Target markets with diverse demand generators, high barriers to entry, favorable supply and demand dynamics and attractive long-term projected RevPAR growth; 

•  

Strong scale and integrated platform – Utilize our scale to create value through enterprise analytics, asset management and capital investment initiatives, while aiding external growth by leveraging scale as a competitive advantage to acquire assets befitting our strategy. Allocate and recycle capital to seek returns that exceed our cost of capital and actively return capital to stockholders; 

•  

Investment grade balance sheet - Maintain a strong and flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout all phases of the lodging cycle; and 

1 

•  

Employer of choice and responsible corporate citizen – Align our organizational structure with our business objectives to be an employer of choice and a responsible corporate citizen. 

Geographically Diverse Portfolio.  

We seek to have a geographically diversified portfolio in major markets and premier resort destinations in the U.S. We primarily focus on acquisitions and, occasionally, new development opportunities to enhance our portfolio. We have historically targeted acquisitions in the top twenty-five U.S. markets but also consider hotels in other markets which we believe have high growth potential and diverse demand generators. We focus generally on the following types of assets: 

•  

Resorts in locations with strong airlift and limited supply growth. These assets feature superior amenities and are operated by premier operators;  

•  

Convention destination hotels that are group oriented in urban and resort markets. These assets feature extensive and high-quality meeting facilities and often are connected to prominent convention centers; and 

•  

High-end urban hotels that are positioned in prime locations and possess multiple demand drivers for both business and leisure travelers. 

As one of the largest owners of Marriott and Hyatt properties, our hotels primarily are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Within these brands, we have focused predominantly on the upper-upscale and luxury chain scales, as we believe these have a broad appeal for both individual and group leisure and business customers. In addition, we own several unbranded or soft-branded hotels that appeal to distinctive customer profiles in certain submarkets.  

Strong Scale and an Integrated Platform  

Enterprise Analytics Platform. Due to the scale of our asset management and business intelligence platform, we believe we are in a unique position to implement value-added real estate decisions and to assist managers in improving operating performance and profitability. The size and composition of our portfolio and our affiliation with most of the leading brands and operators in the industry allow our enterprise analytics team to benchmark similar hotels and identify revenue-enhancement opportunities and cost efficiencies that can maximize the operating performance, long-term profitability and value of our real estate. We perform independent underwriting of return on investment (“ROI”) projects and potential acquisitions, as well as revenue management analysis of ancillary revenue opportunities. Our goal is to continue to differentiate our assets within their competitive markets, drive operating performance and enhance the overall value of our real estate through the following:  

•  

Enhance operating performance and profitability by using our business intelligence system to benchmark and monitor hotel performance and cost controls. 

•  

Drive revenue growth by conducting detailed strategic reviews with our managers on markets and business mix to assist them in developing the appropriate group/transient mix, online presence to address a broad customer base, and market share targets for each property.  

•  

Work with leading brands, such as Marriott and Hyatt, to take advantage of their worldwide presence and lodging infrastructure. We also have a selection of 16 hotels managed by independent operators where we believe these operators have more flexibility to drive revenues and control costs to maximize profits.  

•  

Improve asset value through the extension or purchase of ground leases or the restructuring of management agreements to increase contract flexibility.  

Disciplined Capital Allocation. Guided by a disciplined approach to capital allocation, we are equipped to make investment decisions that seek to deliver the greatest value and returns to stockholders. Our goal is to allocate capital to enhance and improve our portfolio, while balancing the importance of prudently returning capital to stockholders.  

We will continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation. Despite the challenging economic landscape for lodging in 2021, we constantly are evaluating opportunistic acquisitions and dispositions. This may include the sale of assets where we believe the potential for growth is constrained or properties with significant capital expenditure requirements that we do not believe would generate an adequate return. 

We may acquire additional properties or dispose of properties through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotel properties to our stockholders. We anticipate that any acquisitions may be funded by, or through a combination of, proceeds from the sales of hotels, equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., incurrence of debt (currently restricted as discussed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”), available cash or advances under our credit facility. We note, however, that the nature and supply of these assets make acquisitions inherently difficult to predict. For these  

2 

reasons, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in purchasing any one or more hotels that we are reviewing currently, or may in the future review, bid on or negotiate to buy. 

We also seek to create and mine value from our existing portfolio through value enhancement initiatives and ROI projects. We believe these investments provide a significant opportunity to achieve returns well in excess of our cost of capital. We work closely with our managers to attempt to schedule these projects to minimize operational disruption and environmental impact. Value enhancement initiatives seek to maximize the value of real estate within our existing portfolio through the highest and best use of our real estate. These projects may include hotel expansion, timeshare, office space or condominium units on excess land, redevelopment or expansion of existing retail space, and the acquisition of development entitlements. ROI projects are designed to improve the positioning of our hotels within their markets and competitive set. These projects include extensive renovations, including guest rooms, lobbies, food and beverage outlets; expansions and/or extensive renovation of ballroom and meeting rooms; major mechanical system upgrades; and green building initiatives and certifications. It also includes projects focused on increasing space profitability or lowering net operating costs, such as converting unprofitable or underutilized space into meeting space, adding guestrooms, and implementing energy and water conservation measures such as LED lighting, high-efficiency mechanical, electrical and plumbing equipment and fixtures, solar power, energy management systems, guestroom water efficient fixtures, and building automation systems.  

Renewal and replacement capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels. Typically, renovations occur at intervals of approximately seven to ten years, but the timing may vary based on the type of property, function of area being renovated, hotel occupancy and other factors. These renovations generally are divided into the following types: soft goods, case goods, bathroom and architectural and engineering systems. Soft goods include items such as carpeting, textiles and wall finishes, which may require more frequent updates in order to maintain brand quality standards. Case goods include dressers, desks, couches, restaurant and meeting room tables and chairs, which generally are not replaced as frequently. Bathroom renovations include the refurbishment or replacement of tile, vanity, lighting and plumbing fixtures. Architectural and engineering systems include the physical plant of the hotel, including the roof, elevators/escalators, façade, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning and fire systems.  

Throughout the lodging cycle, to the extent that we are unable to find appropriate investment opportunities that meet our return requirements, we will focus on returning capital to stockholders through dividends or common stock repurchases. Significant factors we review to determine the level and timing of the returns to stockholders include our current stock price compared to our determination of the underlying value of our assets, current and forecast operating results and the completion of hotel sales.  

Investment Grade Balance Sheet  

Our goal is to maintain a flexible capital structure that allows us to execute our strategy throughout the lodging cycle. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) to its stockholders each year and, as a result, generally relies on external sources of capital, as well as cash from operations, to finance growth.  

Management believes that a strong balance sheet is a key competitive advantage that affords us a lower cost of debt and positions us for external growth. While we may issue debt at any time, we will target a net debt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) ratio, (or “Leverage Ratio,” as defined in our credit facility) that allows us to maintain an investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt. We believe an investment grade rating will give us the most consistent access to capital throughout the business cycle.  

We seek to structure our debt profile to maintain financial flexibility and a staggered maturity schedule with access to different forms of financing, consisting primarily of senior notes and exchangeable debentures, as well as mortgage debt. Generally, we look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt, minimize near-term maturities and maintain a staggered maturity schedule. Depending on market conditions, we also may utilize variable rate debt which can provide greater protection during a decline in the lodging industry.  

Corporate Responsibility  

We are committed to creating long-term value through investing responsibly in our business, environment, people and community. Our corporate responsibility program is centered around the concept of responsible investment—an overarching strategy that guides our focus and actions across our three main themes of Environmental Stewardship, Social Responsibility and Governance:  

•  

Environmental Stewardship: We are investing in solutions that conserve and restore natural capital to assist us in mitigating climate change and biodiversity impacts and achieving best-in-class returns. 

•  

Social Responsibility: We are committed to advancing health, well-being and opportunity for all of our stakeholders, including investors, employees, partners and communities. 

3 

•  

Governance: Our responsible investment strategies are guided by executive and board-level oversight, our EPIC values and ethical standards, and a disciplined approach to risk management and sustainable value creation. 

The Real Estate Sustainability Accounting Standard issued by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) outlines the disclosure topics and accounting metrics for the real estate industry. The energy and water management metrics that best correlate with our industry include total energy consumed (“Total Energy Consumption”) and total water withdrawn (“Total Water Consumption”). The energy and water data we use is collected and reviewed by third-parties who compile the data from property utility statements.  

Beginning in 2015, we contracted with a third-party to provide further verification of our energy and water consumption data. The charts below detail our Total Energy Consumption and Total Water Consumption for 2017 through 2019, the last three fiscal years for which data is available(1):

Energy and water metrics relate to our consolidated hotels owned for the entire year presented.  

Our expanded and interactive 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report, which details our commitment to corporate responsibility along with our results, performance and progress, including full SASB disclosure, was issued in October 2020.  

The Lodging Industry  

The lodging industry in the United States consists of private and public entities that operate in a diversified market under a variety of brand names. The lodging industry has several key participants:  

•  

Owners—own the hotel and typically enter into an agreement for an independent third-party to manage the hotel. These hotels may be branded and operated under the manager’s brand or branded under a franchise agreement and operated by the franchisee or by an independent hotel manager. The hotels also may be operated as an independent hotel by an independent hotel manager.  

•  

Owner/Managers—own the hotel and operate the property with their own management team. These hotels may be branded under a franchise agreement, operated as an independent hotel or operated under the owner’s brand. We are prohibited from operating and managing hotels by applicable REIT rules.  

•  

Franchisors—own a brand or brands and strive to grow their revenues by expanding the number of hotels in their franchise system. Franchisors provide their hotels with brand recognition, marketing support and centralized reservation systems for the franchised hotels.  

•  

Franchisor/Managers—own a brand or brands and operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner or franchisee.  

•  

Managers—operate hotels on behalf of the hotel owner, but do not, themselves, own a brand. The hotels may be operated under a franchise agreement or as an independent hotel.  

The hotel manager is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the hotel, including the employment of hotel staff, the determination of room rates, the development of sales and marketing plans, the preparation of operating and capital expenditures budgets and the preparation of financial reports for the owner. The hotel manager typically receives fees based on the revenues and profitability of the hotel.  

Supply and Demand. Our industry is influenced by the cyclical relationship between the supply of and demand for hotel rooms. Lodging demand growth typically is related to the vitality of the overall economy, in addition to local market factors that stimulate  

4 

travel to specific destinations. Trends in economic indicators such as gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth, business investment, corporate profits and employment growth are key indicators of the relative strength of lodging demand. Lodging demand also will be affected by changes to international travel patterns.  

Lodging supply growth generally is driven by overall lodging demand, as extended periods of strong demand growth tend to encourage new development. However, the rate of supply growth also is influenced by several additional factors, including the availability of capital, interest rates, construction costs and unique market considerations. The relatively long lead-time required to complete the development of hotels makes supply growth easier to forecast than demand growth, but increases the volatility of the cyclical behavior of the lodging industry, as new supply may be planned during an upcycle but such supply may open for business in a weaker economy. Therefore, as illustrated in the charts below for the U.S. lodging industry, at different points in the cycle, demand growth may accelerate when supply growth is very low, or supply may accelerate while demand growth is slowing. A recent source of supply for the industry has been the rapid growth of online short-term rentals, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings. Though not reported through official industry statistics, the impact on the hotel industry and the availability of these outlets is more variable than typical changes in supply from hotel construction and tends to be very market specific. Local legislation has the potential to limit supply growth for these online short-term rentals in many top markets, though the growth of professional management for legal rentals remains a key trend.  

Our portfolio primarily consists of upper upscale and luxury hotels and, accordingly, its performance is best understood in comparison to the luxury and upper upscale categories rather than the entire industry. The charts below detail the historical supply, demand and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) growth for the U.S. lodging industry and for the U.S. luxury and upper upscale categories for 2016 to 2020. For 2020, RevPAR and demand both suffered unprecedented declines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; therefore, as noted in the charts, the negative scale has been truncated for ease of view and the decline in 2020 is not shown to scale:

Our Customers. Our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business. Similar to the majority of the lodging industry, we further categorize business within these broad groups based on characteristics they have in common as follows:  

Transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than trends in leisure demand. The four key subcategories of rates offered to the transient business group are:  

•  

Retail: This is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the public. It typically is the rate charged to travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates. It includes the “rack rate,” which typically is applied to rooms during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available. Retail room rates will fluctuate more freely depending on anticipated demand levels (e.g., seasonality and weekday vs. weekend stays).  

•  

Non-Qualified Discount: This category includes special rates offered by the hotels, including packages, advance-purchase discounts and promotional offers. It also includes rooms booked through online travel agencies (OTAs).  

•  

Special Corporate: This is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally. These rates typically are negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated retail rate. In addition, this category includes rates offered at the prevailing per diem for approved government travel. 

•  

Qualified Discount: This category encompasses all discount programs, such as AAA and AARP discounts, rooms booked through wholesale channels, frequent guest program redemptions, and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel.  

Group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together, usually with a minimum of 10 rooms. The three key sub-categories of the group business category are:  

•  

Association: group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions.  

•  

Corporate: group business related to corporate meetings (e.g., product launches, training programs, contract negotiations, and presentations).  

•  

Other: group business predominately related to social, military, education, religious, fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams, otherwise known as SMERF business.  

6 

Contract business refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period at significantly discounted rates. Airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our airport hotels. Contract rates may be utilized by hotels that are in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand. 

Managers and Operational Agreements 

All our hotels are managed by third parties pursuant to management or operating agreements, with some of such hotels also subject to separate franchise or license agreements addressing matters pertaining to operations under the designated brand. Under these agreements, the managers have sole responsibility and exclusive authority for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, securing and processing reservations, procuring inventories, supplies and services, providing periodic inspection and consultation visits to the hotels by the managers’ technical and operational experts and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers employ all managerial and other employees for the hotels, review hotel operations with a focus on improving revenues and managing expenses, review the maintenance of the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. These support services include planning and policy services, divisional financial services, product planning and development, employee staffing and training, corporate executive management and certain in-house legal services. We have certain approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.  

General Terms and Provisions – Agreements governing our hotels that are managed by brand owners (Marriott, Hyatt, Hilton and AccorHotels) typically include the terms described below:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

License services. In the case of the Starwood Hotels, operations are governed by separate license agreements addressing matters pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Although the term of these license agreements generally is coterminous with the corresponding operating agreements, the license agreements contemplate the potential for continued brand affiliation even in the event of a termination of the operating agreement (for instance, in the event the hotel is operated by an independent operator). Licensors receive compensation in the form of license fees (generally 5% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and 2% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales), which amounts supplement the lower base management fee of 1% of gross revenues received by Marriott under the operating agreements, as noted above.  

•  

Chain or system programs and services. Managers are required to provide chain or system programs and services generally that are furnished on a centralized basis. Such services include the development and operation of certain computer systems and reservation services, regional or other centralized management and administrative services, marketing and sales programs and services, training and other personnel services, and other centralized or regional services as may be determined to be more efficiently performed on a centralized, regional or group basis rather than on an individual hotel basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing these chain or system programs and services generally are allocated on a cost reimbursement basis among all hotels managed by the manager or its affiliates or that otherwise benefit from these services.  

•  

Working capital and fixed asset supplies. We are required to maintain working capital for each hotel and to fund the cost of certain fixed asset supplies (for example, linen, china, glassware, silver and uniforms). We also are responsible for providing funds to meet the cash needs for hotel operations if at any time the funds available from working capital are insufficient to meet the financial requirements of the hotels. For certain hotels, the working capital accounts which would otherwise be maintained by the managers for each of such hotels are maintained on a pooled basis, with managers being authorized to make withdrawals from such pooled account as otherwise contemplated with respect to working capital in accordance with the provisions of the management or operating agreements.  

7 

•  

Furniture, fixtures and equipment replacements. We are required to provide the managers with all furniture, fixtures and equipment (“FF&E”) necessary for the operation of the hotels (including funding any required FF&E replacements). On an annual basis, the managers prepare budgets for FF&E to be acquired and certain routine repairs and maintenance to be performed in the next year and an estimate of the necessary funds, which budgets are subject to our review and approval. For purposes of funding such expenditures, a specified percentage (typically 4-5%) of the gross revenues of each hotel is deposited by the manager into an escrow or reserve account in our name, to which the manager has access. For certain hotels, we have negotiated flexibility with the manager that reduces the funding commitment required as follows:  

o  

For certain of our Marriott-managed hotels, we have entered into an agreement with Marriott to allow for such expenditures to be funded from one pooled reserve account, rather than periodic reserve fund contributions being deposited into separate reserve accounts at each of the subject hotels, with the minimum required balance maintained on an ongoing basis in that pooled reserve account being significantly less than the amount that would have been maintained otherwise in such separate hotel reserve accounts. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded (either by the purchaser or by us, as the seller) in the full amount of the reserve balance associated with the subject hotel. 

o  

For certain of the Starwood Hotels, periodic reserve fund contributions, which otherwise would be deposited into reserve accounts maintained by managers at each hotel, are distributed to us and we are responsible for providing funding of expenditures which otherwise would be funded from reserve accounts for each of the subject hotels. Upon sale, a hotel-level reserve account would be funded in the amount of the subject hotel’s pro rata share, if any, of the consolidated pooled reserve balance. 

•  

Building alterations, improvements and renewals. The managers are required to prepare an annual estimate of the expenditures necessary for major repairs, alterations, improvements, renewals and replacements to the structural, mechanical, electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, plumbing and elevators of each hotel, along with alterations and improvements to the hotel as are required, in the manager’s reasonable judgment, to keep the hotel in a competitive, efficient and economical operating condition that is consistent with brand standards. We generally have approval rights over such budgets and expenditures, which we review and approve based on our manager’s recommendations and on our judgment. Expenditures for these major repairs and improvements affecting the hotel building typically are funded directly by owners, although our agreements with Marriott in respect of the Starwood Hotels contemplate that certain such expenditures also may be funded from the FF&E reserve account.  

•  

Treatment of additional owner funding. As additional owner funding becomes necessary, either for expenditures generally funded from the FF&E replacement funds, or for any major repairs or improvements to the hotel building which may be required to be funded directly by owners, most of our agreements provide for an economic benefit to us through an impact on the calculation of incentive management fees payable to our managers. One approach frequently utilized at some of our Marriott-managed hotels (excluding the Starwood Hotels) is to provide such owner funding through loans which are repaid, with interest, from operational revenues, with the repayment amounts reducing operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. Another approach that is used at the Starwood Hotels, as well as with certain capital expenditures projects at some of our other hotels, is to treat such owner funding as an increase to our investment in the hotel, resulting in an increase to the owner’s priority return with a corresponding reduction to the amount of operating profit available for payment of incentive management fees. For the hotels that are subject to the pooled arrangement described above, the amount of any additional FF&E reserve account funding is allocated to each of such hotels on a pro rata basis, determined with reference to the net operating income of each hotel and the total net operating income of all such pooled hotels for the most recent operating year.  

•  

Territorial protections. Certain management and operating agreements impose restrictions for a specified period which limit the manager and its affiliates from owning, operating or licensing a hotel of the same brand within a specified area. The area restrictions vary with each hotel, from city blocks in urban areas to up to a multi-mile radius from the hotel in other areas.  

•  

Sale of the hotel. Subject to specific agreements as to certain hotels (see below under “Special Termination Rights”), we generally are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer such hotels by the requirement that the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets specified other conditions, including the condition that the transferee not be a competitor of the manager.  

8 

•  

Performance Termination Rights. In addition to any right to terminate that may arise as a result of a default by the manager, most of our management and operating agreements include reserved rights for us to terminate on the basis of the manager’s failure to meet certain performance-based metrics, typically including a specified threshold return on owner’s investment in the hotel, along with a failure of the hotel to achieve a specified RevPAR performance threshold established with reference to other competitive hotels in the market. Typically, such performance-based termination rights arise in the event the operator fails to achieve these specified performance thresholds over a consecutive two-year period and are subject to the manager’s ability to “cure” and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts (or, in some instances, waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees). We have agreed in the past, and may agree in the future, to waive certain of these termination rights in exchange for consideration from a manager or its affiliates, which consideration may include cash compensation or amendments to management agreements.  

•  

Special Termination Rights. In addition to any performance-based or other termination rights set forth in our management and operating agreements, we have specific negotiated termination rights as to certain management and operating agreements. While the brand affiliation of a hotel may increase its value, the ability to dispose of a property unencumbered by a management agreement, or even brand affiliation, also can increase the value for prospective purchasers. These termination rights can take several different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; or termination without sale or other conditions, which may require the payment of a fee. These termination rights also may restrict the number of agreements that may be terminated over any annual or other period; impose limitations on the number of agreements terminated as measured by EBITDA; require that a certain number of hotels continue to maintain the brand affiliation; or be restricted to a specific pool of assets.  

In addition to hotels managed by brand owners, we have both branded hotels and non-branded hotels operated by independent managers. Our management agreements with independent managers, while similar in operational scope to agreements with our brand managers, typically have shorter initial terms, no renewal rights, more flexible termination rights, and more limited system-wide services. However, while we have additional flexibility with respect to these operators, certain of those hotels remain subject to underlying franchise or licensing agreements. These franchise or licensing agreements allow us to engage independent managers to operate our hotels under the applicable brand names and to participate in the brands’ reservation and loyalty-rewards systems. Under these agreements, we pay the brand owners a franchise or licensing fee equal to a specified percentage of gross room revenues, as well as other system fees and reimbursements. In addition, we are obligated to maintain applicable brand standards at our franchised hotels.  

Operating Structure  

Host Inc. operates through an umbrella partnership structure in which substantially all its assets are owned by Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and holds approximately 99% of the OP units as of December 31, 2020. A REIT is a corporation that has elected to be treated as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that meets certain ownership, organizational and operating requirements set forth under the Code. In general, by payments of dividends to stockholders, a REIT is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level. Each OP unit owned by unaffiliated limited partners other than Host Inc. is redeemable, at the option of the limited partner, for an amount of cash equal to the market value of one share of Host Inc. common stock multiplied by the current conversion factor of 1.021494. Host Inc. has the right to acquire any OP unit offered for redemption directly from the limited partner in exchange for 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock instead of Host L.P. redeeming such OP unit for cash. Additionally, for every share of common stock issued by Host Inc., Host L.P. will issue .97895 OP units to Host Inc. in exchange for the consideration received from the issuance of the common stock. As of December 31, 2020, unaffiliated limited partners owned 7.2 million OP units, which were convertible into 7.3 million Host Inc. common shares. Assuming that all OP units held by unaffiliated limited partners were converted into common shares, there would have been 712.7 million common shares of Host Inc. outstanding at December 31, 2020.

Our operating structure is as follows:  

As a REIT, certain tax laws limit the amount of “non-qualifying” income that Host Inc. and Host L.P. can earn, including income derived directly from the operation of hotels. As a result, we lease substantially all our consolidated hotels to certain of our subsidiaries designated as taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) for federal income tax purposes. Our TRS are subject to corporate income tax and are not limited as to the amount of non-qualifying income they can generate, but they are limited in terms of their value as a percentage of the total value of our assets. Our TRS enter into agreements with third parties to manage the operations of the hotels. Our TRS also may own assets engaging in activities that produce non-qualifying income, such as the development of timeshare or condominium units, subject to certain restrictions. The difference between the hotels’ net operating cash flow and the aggregate rents paid to Host L.P. is retained by our TRS as taxable income or loss. Accordingly, the net effect of the TRS leases is that a portion of the net operating cash flow from our hotels is subject to federal, state and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax.  

Our Consolidated Hotel Portfolio  

As of February 19, 2021, we owned a portfolio of 80 hotels, of which 75 are in the United States and five are located in Brazil and Canada. Our consolidated hotels located outside the United States collectively have approximately 1,500 rooms. Approximately 1% of our revenues in 2020, and 2% in 2019 and 2018, were attributed to the operations of these five foreign hotels. 

The lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. Our portfolio primarily consists of luxury and upper upscale properties, which are operated under internationally recognized brand names such as Marriott, Westin, Ritz-Carlton, Hyatt and Hilton. There also has been a trend towards specialized, smaller boutique hotels that are customized towards a particular customer profile. Generally, these hotels will be operated by an independent third-party and either will have no brand affiliation, or will be associated with a major brand, while maintaining most of its independent identity (which we refer to as “soft-branded” hotels).  

Revenues earned at our hotels consist of three broad categories: rooms, food and beverage, and other revenues. While approximately 60% of our revenues in 2020 are generated from rooms sales, the majority of our properties feature a variety of amenities that help drive demand and profitability. Our hotels typically include meeting and banquet facilities, a variety of restaurants and lounges, swimming pools, exercise facilities and/or spas, gift shops and parking facilities, the combination of which enable them to serve business, leisure and group travelers.  

10 

Our consolidated portfolio includes 32 hotels that have more than 500 rooms. The average age of our properties is 36 years, although substantially all of them have benefited from significant renovations or major additions, as well as regularly scheduled renewal and replacement expenditures and other capital improvements. In our consolidated portfolio, approximately 88% of our hotels, by room count, are managed by their own brand managers, and 12% are managed by independent managers as a franchise or as an independent brand. 

By Brand. The following table details our consolidated hotel portfolio by brand as of February 19, 2021:

Other Real Estate Interests  

We own non-controlling interests in several entities that, as of February 19, 2021, owned, or owned an interest in, 10 hotels. Due to the ownership structure and economic or participating rights of the partners, we do not consolidate the operations of the properties owned by these entities and they are included in equity in earnings in our consolidated results of operations. Our investments in these entities are as follows:  

Asia/Pacific Joint Venture. We have a 25% interest in an Asia/Pacific JV with RECO Hotels JV Private Limited, an affiliate of the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation Pte Ltd. The agreement may be terminated by either partner at any time, which would trigger the liquidation of the joint venture. The commitment period for equity contributions to the Asia/Pacific JV has expired. Certain funding commitments remain, however, related to its existing investments in India. 

13 

As of December 31, 2020, the Asia/Pacific JV has invested approximately $109 million (of which our share is $27 million) in a separate joint venture in India with Accor S.A. and InterGlobe Enterprises Limited, in which it holds a 36% interest. This joint venture owns seven hotels and an office building in Delhi, Bangalore and Chennai, India, totaling approximately 1,720 rooms. The hotels are managed by AccorHotels under the Pullman, ibis and Novotel brands.  

Maui Joint Venture. We own a 67% interest in a joint venture with an affiliate of HV Global Group, a subsidiary of Marriott Vacations Worldwide Corporation, that owns a 131-unit vacation ownership development in Maui, Hawaii adjacent to our Hyatt Regency Maui Resort & Spa (the “Maui JV”). Since 2012, we have contributed approximately $87 million to the Maui JV, which includes the contribution of land valued at $36 million.  

Hyatt Place Joint Venture. We own a 50% interest in a joint venture with White Lodging Services that owns the 255-room Hyatt Place Nashville Downtown in Tennessee. The joint venture has a $60 million mortgage loan that is non-recourse to us.  

Harbor Beach Joint Venture. We own a 49.9% interest in a joint venture with R/V-C Association that owns the 650-room Fort Lauderdale Marriott Harbor Beach Resort & Spa in Florida. The joint venture has approximately $150 million of mortgage debt that is non-recourse to us.  

For additional information see Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 4. Investments in Affiliates.” 

Competition  

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Competition often is specific to individual markets and is based on several factors, including location, brand, guest facilities and amenities, level of service, room rates and the quality of accommodations. The lodging industry is viewed as consisting of six different categories, each of which caters to a discrete set of customer tastes and needs: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and economy. The classification of a hotel is based on lodging industry standards, which take into consideration many factors, such as guest facilities and amenities, level of service and quality of accommodations. Most of our hotels operate in urban and resort markets either as luxury properties under such brand names as Andaz®, Fairmont®, Grand Hyatt®, JW Marriott®, Ritz-Carlton®, St. Regis®, The Luxury Collection® and W®, or as upper upscale properties under such brand names as Embassy Suites®, Hilton®, Hyatt®, Marriott®, Marriott Marquis®, Autograph Collection®, Curio – A Collection by Hilton®, Marriott Suites®, Pullman®, Sheraton®, Swissôtel® and Westin®. (1) While our hotels compete primarily with other hotels in the luxury and upper upscale category, they also may compete with hotels in other lower-tier categories. A recent source of supply for the lodging industry has been the rapid growth of online short-term rentals, including as a flexible option for apartment buildings. Our hotels also may compete with these short-term rentals in certain markets. In addition, many management contracts for our hotels do not prohibit our managers from converting, franchising or developing other hotels in our markets. As a result, our hotels compete with other hotels that our managers may own, invest in, manage or franchise.  

We also compete with other REITs and other public and private investors for the acquisition of new properties and investment opportunities as we attempt to position our portfolio to best take advantage of changes in markets and travel patterns of our customers.  

Seasonality  

Our hotel sales traditionally have experienced moderate seasonality, which varies based on the individual hotel and the region. In 2020, the sharp decline in hotel sales began in March, when many states and localities implemented mandatory quarantines and travel restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and varied for the remainder of the year, resulting in hotel sales for our consolidated portfolio that were approximately 66%, 6%, 12% and 16% for the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarters, respectively, in 2020. In 2019, our sales were approximately 26%, 27%, 23% and 24% for the first, second, third and fourth calendar quarters, respectively.  

Environmental, Governmental and Regulatory Matters  

Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances. These laws may impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, certain environmental laws and common law principles could be used to impose liability for the release of hazardous or toxic materials, and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to released hazardous or toxic materials. Environmental laws also may impose restrictions on the way property may be used or

businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require corrective or other expenditures. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we potentially may be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities. Although currently we are not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us, we can offer no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us in the future.  

Our hotels also are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we have in the past and may in the future incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible. These and other building laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, the imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures.  

Human Capital Resources 

As of February 19, 2021, we had 163 employees, all of whom work in the United States, including our regional offices in Miami and San Diego. The current average tenure of our employees is more than 10 years and the voluntary and total turnover rates in 2020 were 7.7% and 9.4%, respectively. Our human capital objectives include encouraging individual contributions, reinforcing Host’s EPIC values and culture, maximizing employee engagement and retention and minimizing organizational disruption through succession action plans. Our employees are given the opportunity to participate in training and education programs such as external training, professional certifications, executive and leadership coaching, continuing education and professional memberships. Additionally, all employees receive annual performance reviews that incorporate our EPIC values of Excellence, Partnership, Integrity and Community, and our competencies, which include adaptability, communication, teamwork and complete thinking. We encourage regular and ongoing feedback tied to performance and career development. In order to ensure that we are meeting our human capital objectives, we conduct employee surveys to obtain feedback on various topics, informing how we execute on specific programs.  

During 2020, we launched a formal diversity and inclusion initiative. Our CEO joined the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative in order to continue to advance diversity and inclusion within our workplace. We also provide unconscious bias training to our employees and plan to expand upon this training as part of our participation in the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion initiative. As of December 31, 2020, our total workforce consists of 43% men and 57% women, with 43% of management positions held by women.  

The number of employees referenced above does not include the hotel employees of our three hotels in Brazil, which, while technically Host employees, are under the direct supervision and control of our third-party hotel managers. The employees at all of our U.S. and Canadian hotels are employees of our third-party hotel managers, who are responsible for hiring and maintaining employees.  

Although we do not manage employees at our consolidated hotels, we still are subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force. Employees of our third-party hotel managers at 18 of our hotels, representing approximately 25% of our total room count, are covered by collective bargaining agreements that are subject to review and renewal on a regular basis. For a discussion of these relationships, see Part I Item 1A. “Risk Factors—We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.” None of Host’s employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Item 1A.  

Risk Factors  

For an enterprise as large and complex as we are, a wide range of factors could materially affect future results and performance. The statements in this section describe the major risks to our business and should be considered carefully. In addition, these statements constitute our cautionary statements under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 

Financial Risks and Risks of Operation  

The current COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. 

Since first reported in December 2019, the novel coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 disease has spread globally, including to every state in the United States. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and on March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. The pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity, resulting in a global recession, and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. The global impact of the outbreak has been rapidly evolving and, in the United States, certain states and cities, including most where we own hotels, have reacted by instituting various restrictive measures such as quarantines, restrictions on travel, "stay at home" rules, limitations on the size of gatherings, restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate, and/or restrictions on the types of construction projects that may continue. As a result, the COVID-19 pandemic is negatively impacting almost every industry directly or indirectly and is having an outsized impact on the U.S. lodging industry. Many of our hotels are operating at very low occupancy.  

For these reasons, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a sharp decline in revenues at our hotels and significantly adversely affected the ability of our hotel managers to successfully operate our hotels and has had a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows due to, among other factors: 

•  

a sharp decline in group, business and leisure travel resulting from (i) restrictions on travel imposed by governmental entities, public institutions and employers, (ii) the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings, and (iii) the closure or limits on occupancy for amusement parks, museums and other tourist attractions;  

•  

negative public perceptions of travel and public gatherings in light of the perceived risks associated with COVID-19; and  

•  

increased operating costs from implementing enhanced cleaning protocols and other COVID-19 mitigation practices as well as employee severance and furlough costs. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our costs. For example, our managers may need to enhance health and hygiene requirements at our properties in an attempt to counteract future outbreaks. 

In addition, quarantines, temporary closures of businesses, states of emergencies and other restrictive measures taken by governments and organizations may negatively impact the ability of our hotel managers to continue to obtain goods and services necessary for the operation of our hotels, obtain necessary personal protective equipment, provide adequate hotel staffing, provide customary levels of hotel services or operate the hotel in a way that facilitates social distancing, all of which may adversely affect the operation of our hotels. The reduced economic activity also may negatively impact future lodging demand even after the restrictive measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic are lifted as, historically, trends in economic indicators such as gross domestic product, business investment, corporate profits and employment growth (all of which have been negatively impacted) all have been key indicators of the relative strength of future lodging demand.  

The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lodging industry are unprecedented and have materially adversely affected our operations. The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope and severity of the pandemic, the timing of when vaccines become widely available, governmental actions taken to contain the pandemic or to mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. The rapid development and fluidity of the COVID-19 pandemic makes it extremely difficult to assess its full adverse economic impact on our business, financial condition,  

16 

results of operations, liquidity and cash flows. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic also may have the effect of heightening our other risk factors disclosed in this section.  

Our revenues and the value of our hotels are subject to conditions affecting the lodging industry.  

The performance of the lodging industry traditionally has been affected by the strength of the general economy and, specifically, growth in gross domestic product. Because lodging industry demand typically follows the general economy, the lodging industry is highly cyclical, which contributes to potentially large fluctuations in our financial condition and our results of operations. Changes in travel patterns of both business and leisure travelers, particularly during periods of economic contraction or low levels of economic growth, may create difficulties for the industry over the long-term and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the majority of our hotels are classified as luxury or upper upscale and generally target business and high-end leisure travelers. In periods of economic difficulties, business and leisure travelers may seek to reduce travel costs by limiting travel or seeking to reduce the cost of their trips. Consequently, our hotels may be more susceptible to a decrease in revenues during an economic downturn, as compared to hotels in other categories that have lower room rates. Other circumstances affecting the lodging industry which may affect our performance and the forecasts we make include: 

•  

the effect on lodging demand of changes in national and local economic and business conditions, including concerns about the duration and strength of U.S. economic growth, global economic prospects, consumer confidence and the value of the U.S. dollar; 

•  

factors that may shape public perception of travel to a particular location, such as natural disasters, weather events, pandemics and outbreaks of contagious diseases, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the occurrence or potential occurrence of terrorist attacks, all of which will affect occupancy rates at our hotels and the demand for hotel products and services; 

•  

risks that U.S. immigration policies and border closings relating to the COVID-19 pandemic will suppress international travel to the United States generally or decrease the labor pool;  

•  

the impact of geopolitical developments outside the U.S., such as the pace of economic growth in Europe, the effects of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, trade tensions and tariffs between the United States and its trading partners such as China, or conflicts in the Middle East, all of which could affect global travel and lodging demand within the United States;  

•  

volatility in global financial and credit markets, and the impact of budget deficits and pending and future U.S. governmental action to address such deficits through reductions in spending and similar austerity measures, as well as the impact of potential U.S. government shutdowns, which could materially adversely affect U.S. and global economic conditions, business activity, credit availability, borrowing costs, and lodging demand;  

•  

operating risks associated with the hotel business, including the effect of labor stoppages or strikes, increasing operating or labor costs or changes in workplace rules that affect labor costs, and risks relating to the response to the COVID-19 pandemic by our hotel managers, such as increased hotel costs for cleaning protocols and severance and furlough payments to hotel employees;  

•  

the ability of our hotels to compete effectively against other lodging businesses in the highly competitive markets in which we operate in areas such as access, location, quality of accommodations and room rate structures;  

•  

changes in the desirability of the geographic regions of the hotels in our portfolio or in the travel patterns of hotel customers; 

•  

changes in taxes and governmental regulations that influence or set wages, hotel employee health care costs, prices, interest rates or construction and maintenance procedures and costs; and 

•  

decreases in the frequency of business travel that may result from alternatives to in-person meetings, including virtual meetings hosted online or over private teleconferencing networks.  

We cannot assure you that adverse changes in the general economy or other circumstances that affect the lodging industry will not have an adverse effect on the hotel revenues or earnings at our hotels. A reduction in our revenues or earnings because of the above risks may reduce our working capital, impact our long-term business strategy and impact the value of our assets and our ability to meet certain covenants in our existing debt agreements. In addition, we may incur impairment expense in the future, which expense will affect negatively our results of operations. We can provide no assurance that any impairment expense recognized will not be material to our results of operations. 

17 

In addition to general economic conditions affecting the lodging industry, new hotel room supply is an important factor that can affect the lodging industry’s performance and overbuilding has the potential to further exacerbate the negative impact of an economic downturn. Room rates and occupancy, and thus RevPAR, tend to increase when demand growth exceeds supply growth. A reduction or slowdown in the growth of lodging demand or increased growth in lodging supply could result in returns that are substantially below expectations or result in losses which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth. 

We depend on external sources of capital for future growth; therefore, any disruption to our ability to access capital at times, and on terms reasonably acceptable to us, may affect adversely our business and results of operations.  

Since we have elected REIT status, Host Inc. must finance its growth and fund debt repayments largely with external sources of capital because it is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income (other than net capital gain) each year in order to qualify as a REIT. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be required to raise additional capital to fund losses and improve our liquidity position. Our ability to access external capital could be hampered by several factors, many of which are outside of our control, including: 

•  

price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions in the U.S. and global equity and credit markets, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; 

•  

changes in market perception of our growth potential, including rating agency downgrades by Moody’s Investors Service, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services or Fitch Ratings;  

•  

decreases in our current or estimated future earnings or decreases or fluctuations in the market price of the common stock of Host Inc.;  

•  

increases in interest rates; and 

•  

the terms of our existing indebtedness, which currently restrict our incurrence of additional debt while we are below required covenant levels.  

As a result of COVID-19, some credit agencies have placed a “negative outlook” on our credit ratings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded, our access to capital and the cost of debt financing could be further negatively impacted, particularly if we were downgraded to below an investment grade rating. The occurrence of any of the above factors, individually or in combination, could prevent us from being able to obtain the external capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on (i) our ability to finance our future growth and acquire hotels, (ii) our ability to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital, debt service and capital expenditures, and (iii) our results of operations and financial condition. Potential consequences of disruptions in U.S. and global equity and credit markets could include the need to seek alternative sources of capital with less attractive terms, such as more restrictive covenants, shorter maturity and higher costs which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and liquidity. 

We operate in a highly competitive industry. 

The lodging industry is highly competitive. Our principal competitors are other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels, including other lodging REITs. Our hotels face strong competition for individual guests, group reservations and conference business from major hospitality chains with well-established and recognized brands, as well as from other smaller hotel chains, independent and local hotel owners and operators. Our hotels compete for customers primarily based on brand name recognition and reputation, as well as location, room rates, property size and availability of rooms and conference space, quality of the accommodations, customer satisfaction, amenities and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points. During the COVID-19 pandemic, our hotels also compete for customers based on cleanliness protocols adopted in response to the pandemic. New hotels may be constructed and these additions to supply create new competitors, in some cases without corresponding increases in demand for hotel rooms. Our competitors may have similar or greater commercial and financial resources which allow them to improve their hotels in ways that affect our ability to compete for guests effectively and adversely affect our revenues and profitability as well as limit or slow our future growth. We also compete for hotel acquisitions with others that have similar investment objectives to ours. This competition could limit the number of investment opportunities that we find suitable for our business. It also may increase the bargaining power of hotel owners seeking to sell to us, making it more difficult for us to acquire new hotels on attractive terms or on the terms contemplated in our business plan.  

The growth of internet reservation channels also is a source of competition that could adversely affect our business. A significant percentage of hotel rooms for individual or “transient” customers are booked through internet travel intermediaries. Search engines and peer-to-peer inventory sources also provide online travel services that compete with our hotels. If bookings shift to higher  

18 

cost distribution channels, including these internet travel intermediaries, it could materially impact our revenues and profitability. Additionally, as intermediary bookings increase, they may be able to obtain higher commissions, reduced room rates or other significant contract concessions from the brands and hotel management companies managing and operating our hotels. Also, although internet travel intermediaries traditionally have competed to attract transient business rather than group and convention business, in recent years they have expanded their business to include marketing to large group and convention business. If that expansion continues, it could both divert group and convention business away from our hotels and increase our cost of sales for group and convention business and materially adversely affect our revenues and profitability. 

There are inherent risks with investments in real estate, including their relative illiquidity. 

Investments in real estate are inherently illiquid and generally cannot be sold quickly. For this reason, we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel that we desire to sell for the price or on terms acceptable to us, or the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close on the sale of a hotel. Therefore, we may not be able to vary the composition of our portfolio promptly in response to changing economic, financial and investment conditions and dispose of hotels at opportune times or on favorable terms, which may adversely affect our cash flows and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders. In addition, real estate ownership is subject to various risks, including: 

•  

government regulations relating to real estate ownership or operations, including tax, environmental, zoning and eminent domain laws; 

•  

loss in value of real estate due to changes in market conditions or the area in which it is located or losses in value due to changes in tax laws or increased property tax assessments; 

•  

potential civil liability for accidents or other occurrences on owned or leased properties; 

•  

the ongoing need for owner-funded capital improvements and expenditures in order to maintain or upgrade hotels; 

•  

periodic total or partial closures due to renovations and facility improvements; and 

•  

force majeure events, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, floods or other possibly uninsured losses. 

We have significant indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.  

As of December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries had total indebtedness of approximately $5.5 billion. We have significantly increased our indebtedness in the past year and have substantially utilized the full $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of our credit facility in order to increase our cash position and to preserve financial flexibility in light of the impact resulting from COVID-19. Our indebtedness requires us to commit a significant portion of our annual cash flow from operations to debt service payments, which reduces the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, expansion efforts, dividends and distributions and other general corporate needs. Additionally, our substantial indebtedness could:  

•  

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;  

•  

limit our ability in the future to undertake refinancings of our debt or to obtain financing for expenditures, acquisitions, development or other general corporate needs on terms and conditions acceptable to us, if at all; or  

•  

affect adversely our ability to compete effectively or operate successfully under adverse economic conditions.  

If our cash flow and working capital are not sufficient to fund our expenditures or service our indebtedness, we will be required to raise additional funds through sales of common or preferred OP units of Host L.P. or common or preferred stock of Host Inc., the incurrence of additional permitted indebtedness by Host L.P. (which is currently unavailable to us due to limits placed on incurring additional debt under our senior notes) or sales of our assets. We cannot make any assurances that any of these sources of funds will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms that we would find acceptable or in amounts sufficient to meet our obligations or fulfill our business plan.  

19 

The terms of our indebtedness place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries and these restrictions reduce our operational flexibility and create default risks.  

We are, and may in the future become, party to agreements and instruments that place restrictions on us and on our subsidiaries. For instance, the covenants in the documents governing the terms of our senior notes and our credit facility restrict, among other things, our ability to:  

•  

incur additional indebtedness in excess of certain thresholds and without satisfying certain financial metrics which we do not currently meet;  

•  

pay dividends on classes and series of Host Inc. capital stock and pay distributions on Host L.P.’s classes of units or make stock repurchases without satisfying certain financial metrics concerning leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage; and 

•  

incur capital expenditures, make hotel acquisitions, or sell assets without using the proceeds to repay indebtedness.  

In addition, certain covenants in our credit facility also require us and our subsidiaries to meet financial metrics which are currently waived due to the pandemic but which we would not otherwise satisfy. The restrictive covenants in our senior notes and credit facility reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations and limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Failure to comply with these restrictive covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all or a substantial portion of our indebtedness. For a detailed description of the covenants and restrictions imposed by the documents governing our indebtedness and the terms of our current waiver under the credit facility, see Part II Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition.” 

Our expenses may not decrease if our revenues decrease.  

Many of the expenses associated with owning and operating hotels, such as debt-service payments, property taxes, insurance, utilities, and employee wages and benefits, are relatively inflexible. They do not necessarily decrease directly with a reduction in revenues at the hotels and may be subject to increases that are not tied to the performance of our hotels or the increase in the rate of inflation generally. Additionally, certain costs, such as wages, benefits and insurance, may exceed the rate of inflation in any given period. In the event of a significant decrease in demand, our hotel managers may not be able to reduce the size of hotel work forces in order to decrease wages and benefits. Our managers also may be unable to offset any fixed or increased expenses with higher room rates. Any of our efforts to reduce operating costs also could adversely affect the future growth of our business and the value of our hotels. 

Our acquisition of hotels may have a significant effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations.  

We routinely are actively engaged in the process of identifying, analyzing and negotiating possible transactions for acquiring hotels. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions on favorable terms or that we will realize the benefits that we anticipate from such acquisitions. Our failure to realize the intended benefits from one or more acquisitions could have a significant adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial position and/or results of operations. These adverse effects may occur because the performance of the hotel does not support the additional indebtedness and related interest expense that we incurred as a result of the acquisition. In addition, hotels and entities that we have acquired, or may in the future acquire, may be subject to unknown or contingent liabilities for which we may have no recourse, or only limited recourse, against the sellers. In general, the representations and warranties provided in the transaction agreements may not survive long enough for us to become aware of such liabilities and to seek recourse against our sellers and indemnification covering representations and warranties often is limited and subject to various materiality thresholds, a significant deductible or an aggregate cap on losses. As a result, there is no guarantee that we will recover any amounts with respect to losses due to breaches by the sellers of their representations and warranties.  

We may not achieve the value we anticipate from new hotel developments or value enhancement projects at our existing hotels. 

We currently are, and in the future may be, involved in the development or redevelopment of hotels, timeshare units or other alternate uses of portions of our existing hotels, including the development of retail, office or apartments, and including through joint ventures. There are risks inherent in any new development, including: 

•  

We may not obtain the zoning, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations necessary to complete the development. A delay in receiving these approvals could affect adversely the returns we expect to receive.  

20 

•  

Any new construction involves the possibility of construction delays and cost overruns that may increase project costs. 

•  

Defects in design or construction may result in delays and additional costs to remedy the defect or require a portion of a hotel to be closed during the period required to remedy the defect. 

•  

We may not be able to meet the loan covenants in any indebtedness obtained to fund the new development, creating default risks.  

•  

Risks related to change in economic and market conditions between development commencement and stabilization. 

Any of the above factors could affect adversely our ability to complete the developments on schedule and consistent with the scope that currently is contemplated, or to achieve the intended value of these projects 

We do not control our hotel operations and we are dependent on the managers of our hotels.  

To maintain our status as a REIT, we are not permitted to operate or manage any of our hotels. As a result, we, through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, have entered into management agreements with third-party managers to operate our hotels. For this reason, we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions with respect to the daily operation and marketing of our hotels, such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates, food and beverage pricing and certain similar matters. Although we consult with our hotel operators with respect to strategic business plans, the hotel operators are under no obligation to implement any of our recommendations with respect to these matters. While we monitor the hotel managers’ performance, we have limited recourse under our management agreements if we believe that the hotel managers are not performing adequately. The cash flow from our hotels may be affected adversely if our managers fail to provide quality services and amenities or if they or their affiliates fail to maintain a quality brand name. Because our management agreements are long-term in nature, we also may not be able to terminate these agreements if we believe the manager is not performing adequately.  

From time to time, we have had, and continue to have, disputes with the managers of our hotels over their performance and compliance with the terms of our management agreements. If we are unable to reach satisfactory results through discussions and negotiations, we may choose to litigate the dispute or submit the matter to third-party dispute resolution. Failure by our hotel managers to fully perform the duties agreed to in our management agreements or the failure of our managers to adequately manage the risks associated with hotel operations could affect adversely our results of operations.  

In addition, our hotel managers or their affiliates manage, and in some cases own, have invested in, or provided credit support or operating guarantees, to hotels that compete with our hotels, all of which may result in conflicts of interest. As a result, our hotel managers have in the past made, and may in the future make, decisions regarding competing lodging facilities that are not or would not be in our best interest. Furthermore, our management agreements for our brand managed properties generally have provisions that can restrict our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels, unless the transferee is not a competitor of the manager and the transferee assumes the related management agreements and meets other specified conditions. Our ability to finance or sell our hotels, depending upon the structure of the transactions, may require the manager’s consent. Similarly, decisions with respect to the repositioning of a hotel, such as the outsourcing of food and beverage outlets, also may require the manager’s consent.  

The properties managed by Marriott International account for most of our revenues and operating income. Adverse developments in Marriott’s business and affairs or financial condition could have a material adverse effect on us.  

Approximately 70% of our hotels (as measured by 2020 revenues) are managed or franchised by Marriott International. We rely on Marriott’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage and maintain our hotel operations efficiently, effectively, profitably and in compliance with the terms, responsibilities and duties of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Marriott’s business and affairs or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our hotels and could have a material adverse effect on us.  

We are subject to risks associated with the employment of hotel personnel, particularly with hotels that employ unionized labor.  

Our third-party managers are responsible for hiring, maintaining and managing the labor force at each of our hotels. We do not directly employ or manage employees at our consolidated hotels (other than employing, but not managing, directing or supervising, the employees at our three hotels in Brazil). However, we remain subject to many of the costs and risks generally associated with the hotel labor force, particularly at those hotels with unionized labor. From time to time, hotel operations may be disrupted because of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity. We also may incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs because of disputes involving our third-party managers and their labor force. The resolution of labor disputes or re-negotiated labor contracts could lead to increased labor costs, a significant component of our hotel operating costs, either by increases  

21 

in wages or benefits or by changes in work rules that raise hotel operating costs. As we are not the employer nor bound by any collective bargaining agreement, we do not negotiate with any labor organization, and it is the responsibility of each hotel’s manager to enter into such labor contracts. Our ability, if any, to have any meaningful impact on the outcome of these negotiations is restricted by and dependent on the individual management agreement covering a specific hotel and we may have little or no ability to control the outcome of these negotiations. 

Our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and potentially significant capital expenditures in order to remain competitive in the marketplace, to maintain brand standards or to comply with applicable laws or regulations. The timing and costs of such renovations or improvements may result in reduced operating performance during construction and may not improve the return on these investments.  

We will need to make capital expenditures in order to remain competitive with other hotels, to maintain the economic value of our hotels and to comply with applicable laws and regulations. We also are required by our hotel management agreements to make agreed upon capital expenditures to our hotels. In addition, the timing of these improvements can affect hotel performance, particularly if the improvements require closure of a significant number of rooms or other features of the hotels, such as ballrooms, meeting space and restaurants. These capital improvements reduce the availability of cash for other purposes and are subject to cost overruns and delays. In addition, because we depend on external sources of capital, we may not have the necessary funds to invest and, if we fail to maintain our hotels in accordance with brand standards set by our managers, they may terminate the management agreement. Moreover, we may not necessarily realize a significant, or any, improvement in the performance of the hotels at which we make these investments.  

A large proportion of our hotels are located in a limited number of large urban cities and, accordingly, we could be disproportionately harmed by adverse changes to these markets, a natural disaster or the threat of a terrorist attack.  

Hotels in the following cities and markets represented approximately 67% of our 2020 revenues: New York, Washington, D.C., San Diego, San Francisco, Boston, Florida, Hawaii, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. An economic downturn, an increase in hotel supply in these cities and markets, a natural disaster, a terrorist attack or similar disaster in any one of these cities and markets likely would cause a decline in hotel demand and adversely affect occupancy rates, the financial performance of our hotels in these cities and markets and our overall results of operations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, large urban markets with enhanced restrictions on social gatherings have been disproportionately impacted by the decline in lodging demand. Additionally, in September 2017, our operations in Florida and Houston were impacted negatively by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. The threat of terrorism also may negatively impact hotel occupancy and average daily rate, due to resulting disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and concerns about travel safety. Hotels in major metropolitan areas, such as the major cities that represent our largest markets, may be particularly adversely affected due to concerns about travel safety.  

We may acquire or develop hotels in joint ventures with third parties that could result in conflicts.  

We have made investments in joint ventures and are exploring further investment or development opportunities. We may, from time to time, invest as a co-venturer in other entities owning hotels instead of purchasing them directly. We also may sell interests in existing hotels to a third-party as part of forming a joint venture with the third-party. Investments in joint ventures may involve risks not present were a third-party not involved, including the possibility that partners or co-venturers might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions. Co-venturers often share control over the operations of a joint venture. Actions by a co-venturer also could subject the hotels to additional risks because our co-venturer might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals. Disputes between us and our partners or co-venturers may result in litigation that would increase our expenses and may negatively impact hotel operations.  

Some potential losses are not covered by insurance.  

We carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability, property, business interruption, cyber threats, terrorism and other risks with respect to all our hotels and other properties. In a limited number of instances, and certain coverages related to hotel managers’ employer status, properties instead may be insured under the hotel manager’s policies. As of February 2021, all consolidated hotels currently are covered under the company’s property insurance. These policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar types of properties. Generally, our “all-risk” property policies provide coverage that is available on a per-occurrence basis and that, for each occurrence, has an overall limit, as well as various sub-limits, on the amount of insurance proceeds we can receive. Sub-limits exist for certain types of claims, such as service interruption, debris removal, expediting costs, landscaping replacement and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods and hurricanes, and may be subject to annual aggregate coverage limits. The dollar amounts of these sub-limits are significantly lower than the dollar amounts of the overall coverage limit. In this regard, hotels in certain of our markets, including California, Florida, Hawaii, Houston, New Orleans and  

22 

Seattle, have in the past been and continue to be particularly susceptible to damage from natural disasters and the applicable sub-limits are significantly lower than the total value of the hotels we own in states where natural disasters are possible. Recovery under the applicable policies also is subject to substantial deductibles and complex calculations of lost business income. There is no assurance that this insurance, where maintained, will fully fund the re-building or restoration of a hotel that is impacted by an earthquake, hurricane, or other natural disaster, or a terrorism event, or will fully fund the income lost as a result of the damage. Our property insurance policies also provide that all of the claims from each of our properties resulting from a particular insurable event must be combined for purposes of evaluating whether the aggregate limits and sub-limits provided in our policies have been exceeded and, in the case where the manager of one of our hotels provides this coverage, any such claims will be combined with the claims of other owners participating in the manager’s program for the same purpose. Therefore, if an insurable event occurs that affects more than one of our hotels, the claims from each affected hotel will be added together to determine whether the aggregate limit or sub-limits, depending on the type of claim, have been reached. Each affected hotel only may receive a proportional share of the amount of insurance proceeds provided for under the policy if the total value of the loss exceeds the aggregate limits available. For example, if a hurricane were to cause widespread damage to Florida or up the East Coast, claims from each of our hotels would be aggregated against the policy limit or sub-limit and likely would exceed the applicable limit or sub-limit. We may incur losses in excess of insured limits, and we may be even less likely to receive complete coverage for risks that affect multiple properties, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, or certain types of terrorism.  

In addition, there are other risks relating to property insurance, such as certain environmental hazards, that may be deemed to fall completely outside the general coverage limits of our policies or may be uninsurable or too expensive to justify coverage. Also, insurance coverage for war, infectious disease, and nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological perils is extremely limited. We also may encounter challenges with an insurance provider regarding whether it will pay a particular claim that we believe to be covered under our policy. Should a loss in excess of insured limits or an uninsured loss occur, or should we be unsuccessful in obtaining coverage from an insurance carrier, we could lose all or a part of the capital we have invested in a hotel, as well as its anticipated future revenues.  

Cyber threats and the risk of data breaches or disruptions of our managers’ or our own information technology systems could materially adversely affect our business. 

Our third-party hotel managers are dependent on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to access, process, transmit and store proprietary and customer information. These complex networks include reservation systems, vacation exchange systems, hotel management systems, customer databases, call centers, administrative systems, and third-party vendor systems. These systems require the collection and retention of large volumes of personally identifiable information of hotel guests, including credit card numbers and passport numbers. Our hotel managers may store and process such proprietary and customer information both on systems located at the hotels that we own and other hotels that they operate and manage, their corporate locations and at third-party owned facilities, including, for example, in a third-party hosted cloud environment. These information networks and systems have been and continue to be vulnerable to threats such as system, network or internet failures; computer hacking or business disruption; cyber-terrorism; viruses, worms or other malicious software programs; and employee error, negligence or fraud. These threats can be introduced in any number of ways, including through third parties accessing our hotel managers’ information networks and systems. The risks from these cyber threats are significant and, Marriott International, the manager of a majority of our hotels, experienced a material data security breach involving the unauthorized access to the Starwood guest reservation database between 2014 and 2018. As of this date, Marriott has been named as a defendant in various lawsuits and investigations arising out of the database breach and no assurances can be made as to the outcome of these lawsuits or investigations. 

We rely on the security systems of our managers to protect proprietary and hotel customer information from these threats. Any compromise of our managers’ networks could result in a disruption to our managers’ operations, such as the disruption in fulfilling guest reservations, delayed bookings or sales, or lost guest reservations. Any of these events could, in turn, result in disruption of the operations of the hotels that we own that are managed by them, in increased costs and in potential litigation and liability. All our major hotel management companies and a majority of our third-party operators maintain insurance against cyber threats. However, these policies provide varying limits and may be subject to sub-limits for certain types of claims, and it is not expected that these policies will provide a total recovery of all potential losses. In addition, public disclosure, or loss of customer or proprietary information, such as disclosed by Marriott in November 2018, may result in damage to the manager’s reputation and a loss of confidence among hotel guests and result in reputational harm for the hotels owned by us and managed by them, which may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations.  

In addition to the information technologies and systems of our managers used to operate our hotels, we have our own corporate technologies and systems that are used to access, store, transmit, and manage or support a variety of our business processes. There can be no assurance that the security measures we have taken to protect the contents of these systems will prevent failures, inadequacies or interruptions in system services or that system security will not be breached through physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, and attacks by hackers. Disruptions in service, system shutdowns and security breaches in the information technologies and  

23 

systems we use, including unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, could have a material adverse effect on our business, our financial reporting and compliance, and subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties, which amounts could be significant. We currently maintain cyber insurance, which includes coverage for third-party liability (damages and settlements to third parties) and first-party loss (costs incurred by us in response to a network security or privacy event). However, as with our operator’s coverage, our policy is subject to limits and sub-limits for certain types of claims and we do not expect that this policy will cover all the losses that we could experience from these exposures.  

Applicable REIT laws may restrict certain business activities.  

As a REIT, each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT is subject to various restrictions on the types of revenues it can earn, assets it can own and activities in which it can engage. Business activities that could be restricted by applicable REIT laws include, but are not limited to, developing alternative uses of real estate and the ownership of hotels that are not leased to a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”), including the development and/or sale of timeshare or condominium units or the related land parcels. Due to these restrictions, we anticipate that we will continue to conduct certain business activities, including, but not limited to, those mentioned above, in one or more of our TRS. Our TRS are taxable as regular C corporations and are subject to federal, state, local, and, if applicable, foreign taxation on their taxable income.  

We face possible risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change. 

We are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which can include more frequent or severe storms, droughts, hurricanes and flooding, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations and business. Over time, our coastal markets are expected to experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea levels causing damage to our hotels. As a result, we could become subject to significant losses and/or repair costs that may or may not be fully covered by insurance. Other markets may experience prolonged variations in temperature or precipitation that may limit access to the water needed to operate our hotels or significantly increase energy costs, which may subject those hotels to additional regulatory burdens, such as limitations on water usage or stricter energy efficiency standards. Climate change also may affect our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable in areas most vulnerable to such events, increasing operating costs at our hotels, such as the cost of water or energy, and requiring us to expend funds as we seek to repair and protect our hotels against such risks. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our hotels, operations or business. 

Risks of Ownership of Host Inc.’s Common Stock  

There are limitations on the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock and changes in control.  

Host Inc.’s charter and by-laws, the partnership agreement of Host L.P., and the Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for Host Inc.’s stockholders or Host L.P.’s unitholders, including the following:  

•  

Restrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.’s stock. To assist in maintaining Host Inc.’s qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, Host Inc.’s charter prohibits ownership, directly or by attribution, by any person or persons acting as a group, of more than 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of shares of Host Inc.’s outstanding common stock, preferred stock or any other class or series of stock, each considered as a separate class or series for this purpose. Together, these limitations are referred to as the “ownership limit.” Stock acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred automatically to a trust for the benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary, and the intended acquirer of the stock in violation of the ownership limit will not be entitled to vote those shares of stock or to receive the economic benefits of owning shares of Host Inc.’s stock in excess of the ownership limit. A transfer of shares of Host Inc.’s stock to a person who, as a result of the transfer, violates the ownership limit also may be void under certain circumstances.  

•  

Removal of members of the Board of Directors. Host Inc.’s charter provides that, except for any directors who may be elected by holders of a class or series of shares of capital stock other than common stock, directors may be removed only for cause and by the affirmative vote of stockholders holding at least two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors. Any vacancy resulting from the removal of a director by the stockholders may be filled by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast in the election of directors.  

•  

Preferred shares; classification or reclassification of unissued shares of capital stock without stockholder approval. Host Inc.’s Board of Directors has the authority, without a vote of stockholders, to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of stock into other classes or series of stock, and to establish the terms, preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers,  

24 

restrictions, limitations as to dividends and other distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption for each class or series. Host Inc.’s Board of Directors may give the holders of any class or series of stock terms, preferences, powers and rights, including voting rights, senior to the rights of holders of existing stock.  

•  

Certain provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of Host Inc. Certain provisions of the MGCL may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from acquiring Host Inc., including: 

o  

“business combination” provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between a corporation and an “interested stockholder” (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of the corporation’s then outstanding shares of voting stock) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and  

o  

“control share” provisions that provide that holders of “control shares” of a corporation (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a “control share acquisition” have no voting rights except to the extent approved by the stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares. 

Host Inc. is subject to the Maryland business combination statute. Our bylaws contain a provision exempting us from the control share provisions of the MGCL. There can be no assurance that this bylaw provision exempting us from the control share provisions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.  

•  

Certain charter amendments. Host Inc.’s charter contains provisions relating to restrictions on transfer and ownership of Host Inc.’s stock, fixing the size of the Board of Directors within the range set forth in the charter, removal of directors, the filling of vacancies, exculpation and indemnification of directors, calling special stockholder meetings and others, all of which may be amended only by a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by Host Inc.’s stockholders holding two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter. These provisions may make it more difficult to amend Host Inc.’s charter to alter the provisions described herein that could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control or the acquisition of Host Inc. common stock, without the approval of the Board of Directors.  

Federal Income Tax Risks  

Adverse tax consequences would occur if Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT. 

We believe that Host Inc. has been organized and has operated in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT under the Code, commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 1999, and Host Inc. currently intends to continue to operate and qualify as a REIT during future years. In addition, Host Inc. owns, through Host L.P., one entity that also has elected to be treated as a REIT. As the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT are extremely complex and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification and taxation as a REIT are limited, no assurance can be provided that Host Inc. currently qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT or that Host Inc.’s subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT or will continue to qualify as a REIT. If our subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it is possible that Host Inc. would fail to qualify as a REIT unless it (or the subsidiary REIT) could avail itself of certain relief provisions. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income. Any such corporate income tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the non-qualifying REIT’s cash available for, among other things, operations and dividends to its stockholders. In addition, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, it would not be required to pay dividends to its stockholders. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.  

To qualify as a REIT, Host Inc. is required to satisfy the requirements of several asset and gross income tests. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets, some of which assets are not susceptible to a precise determination of fair market value, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance with the REIT asset and gross income tests requirements also depends upon our ability to successfully manage the composition of our gross income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) will not contend that our hotel leases, interests in subsidiaries, or interests in the securities of other issuers will not cause a violation of the REIT gross income and asset tests requirements. 

Any determination that Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT does not qualify as a REIT will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could reduce materially the value of Host Inc.’s common stock. The additional corporate income tax liability  

25 

of Host Inc. or the subsidiary REIT for the year, or years, in which it does not qualify as a REIT would reduce its cash flow available for investment, debt service or dividends to stockholders. Furthermore, the entity not qualifying as a REIT no longer would be required to pay dividends to its stockholders as a condition to REIT qualification, and any dividends paid to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary C corporation dividends to the extent of its current and accumulated earnings and profits. This means that, if Host Inc. were to fail to qualify as a REIT, Host Inc.’s stockholders currently taxed as individuals would be taxed on dividends at capital gain tax rates and Host Inc.’s corporate stockholders generally would be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to such dividends, subject in each case to applicable limitations under the Code. Host Inc.’s failure to qualify as a REIT also would cause an event of default under Host L.P.’s credit facility, which default could lead to an acceleration of the amounts due thereunder, which, in turn, would constitute an event of default under Host L.P.’s outstanding debt securities.  

If our hotel managers do not qualify as “eligible independent contractors,” or if our hotels are not “qualified lodging facilities,” each of Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT will fail to qualify as a REIT. 

Each hotel with respect to which our TRS pays rent must be a “qualified lodging facility.” A “qualified lodging facility” is a hotel, motel, or other establishment more than one-half of the dwelling units in which are used on a transient basis, including customary amenities and facilities, provided that no wagering activities are conducted at or in connection with such facility by any person who is engaged in the business of accepting wagers and who legally is authorized to engage in such business at or in connection with such facility. We believe that all the hotels leased to our TRS are qualified lodging facilities. However, the REIT provisions of the Code provide only limited guidance for making determinations of whether a hotel is considered a qualified lodging facility, and there can be no assurance that our hotels will be so considered in all cases. 

If our hotel managers do not qualify as “eligible independent contractors,” Host Inc. and our subsidiary REIT likely will fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Each of the hotel management companies that enters into a management contract with our TRS must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” under the REIT rules in order for the rent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS to be qualifying gross income for the REIT gross income tests requirements. Among other requirements, in order to qualify as an eligible independent contractor, a hotel manager cannot own more than 35% of our outstanding shares (by value) and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares and the ownership interests of the hotel manager, taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect to ownership interests in such hotel managers that are publicly traded, only owners of more than 5% of such ownership interests. Complex ownership attribution rules apply for purposes of these 35% ownership thresholds. Although we monitor ownership of our shares by our hotel managers and their owners, and certain provisions of our charter are designed to prevent ownership of our shares in violation of these rules, there can be no assurance that these ownership limits will not be exceeded. 

The size of our TRS is limited and our transactions with our TRS will cause us to be subject to a 100% excise tax on certain income or deductions if such transactions are not conducted on arm’s-length terms. 

A REIT may own up to 100% of the equity interests of an entity that is a C corporation for federal income tax purposes if the entity is a TRS. A TRS may own assets and earn gross income that would not be considered as qualifying assets or as qualifying gross income if owned or earned directly by a REIT, including revenues from hotel operations. Both the REIT and its C corporation subsidiary must jointly elect to treat such C corporation subsidiary as a TRS. A C corporation of which a TRS directly or indirectly owns more than 35% of the voting power or value of its stock or securities automatically will be treated as a TRS. For taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, no more than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the total value of a REIT’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS.  

Our TRS will pay federal corporate income tax and applicable state and local corporate income tax and, if applicable, foreign corporate income tax on its taxable income. The after-tax net income of our TRS will be available for distribution to us as a taxable dividend to the extent of its accumulated earnings and profits, but it is not required to be so distributed. We believe that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of our TRS has been and will continue to be less than 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) of the total value of our assets (including our TRS stock and securities). Furthermore, we monitor the value of our investments in our TRS for the purpose of ensuring compliance with this 20% requirement. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the 20% (25% for taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008 and on or before December 31, 2017) value limitation discussed above. 

Rent paid to Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT by our TRS cannot be based on its net income or profits for such rents to qualify as “rents from real property.” We receive “percentage rent” from our TRS that is calculated based on the gross revenues of the hotels subject to leases - not based on net income or profits of such hotels. If the IRS determines that the rent paid pursuant to our leases with our TRS are excessive, the deductibility thereof by the TRS may be challenged, and we could be subject to a 100% excise tax on “re-determined rent” or “re-determined deductions” to the extent that such rent exceeds an arm’s-length amount. We believe that our rent  

26 

and other transactions between our REITs and their TRS are based on arm’s-length amounts and reflect normal business practices, but there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with our belief. 

Despite the REIT status of each of Host Inc. and its subsidiary REIT, we remain subject to various taxes.  

Notwithstanding Host Inc.’s status as a REIT, Host Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (including our subsidiary REIT) are subject to federal, state, local and foreign corporate taxes on their net income, gross receipts, net worth, and property, in certain cases. Host L.P. is obligated under its partnership agreement to pay all such taxes (and any related interest and penalties) incurred by Host Inc.  

Legislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us. 

New legislation, treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions could change significantly the tax laws with respect to an entity’s qualification as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of its REIT qualification. If Host Inc. or its subsidiary REIT were to fail to qualify as a REIT, and any available relief provisions did not apply, the non-qualifying REIT would not be allowed to take a deduction for dividends paid to its stockholders in computing its taxable income, and it would be subject to federal and state corporate income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates. Moreover, unless entitled to statutory relief, the non-qualifying REIT could not qualify as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which REIT qualification was lost.  

Risks Relating to Redemption of OP Units  

A holder who offers its OP units for redemption may have adverse tax consequences. 

A limited partner who elects to redeem its OP units will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as having sold the OP units, resulting in a taxable event to such limited partner. The gain or loss recognized by the limited partner is measured by the difference between the amount realized thereby and the tax basis in the OP units redeemed (which tax basis includes the amount of the qualified nonrecourse liabilities of Host L.P. allocated to the redeemed OP units). It is possible that the amount of gain and/or the tax liability related thereto that the limited partner recognizes and pays could exceed the value of the common stock or cash received from the redemption of its OP units.  

General Risk Factors  

Shares of Host Inc.’s common stock that are or become available for sale could affect the share price of Host Inc.’s common stock.  

We have in the past issued and may in the future issue additional shares of common stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions, fund capital expenditures, refinance debt or for other corporate purposes. Sales of a substantial number of shares of Host Inc.’s common stock, or the perception that sales could occur, could affect adversely prevailing market prices for Host Inc.’s common stock. In addition, limited partners of Host L.P. who redeem their OP units and receive, at Host Inc.’s election, shares of Host Inc. common stock will be able to sell those shares freely. As of December 31, 2020, there are approximately 7.2 million Host LP OP units outstanding that are owned by third parties and that are redeemable, which represents approximately 1% of all outstanding OP units. Further, shares of Host Inc.’s common stock have been and will be issued or reserved for issuance from time to time under our employee benefit plans. We currently maintain two stock-based compensation plans: (i) the comprehensive stock and cash incentive plan, and (ii) an employee stock purchase plan. At December 31, 2020, there were approximately 15 million shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the comprehensive stock plan and employee stock purchase plan. 

An increase in interest rates would increase the interest costs on our credit facility and on our floating rate indebtedness and could impact adversely our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or to sell assets.  

Interest payments for borrowings on our credit facility and the mortgages on certain non-consolidated properties are based on floating rates. As a result, an increase in interest rates will reduce our cash flow available for other corporate purposes, including investments in our portfolio. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 45% of our debt is subject to floating interest rates. Rising interest rates also could limit our ability to refinance existing indebtedness when it matures and increase interest costs on any indebtedness that is refinanced. We may from time to time enter into agreements such as floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, caps, floors and other hedging contracts in order to fully or partially hedge against the cash flow effects of changes in interest rates for floating rate debt. These agreements expose us to the risk that other parties to the agreements will not perform or that the agreements  

27 

will be unenforceable. In addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amount third parties are willing to pay for our hotels, thereby limiting our ability to dispose of them as part of our business strategy.  

A portion of our long-term indebtedness, specifically $2.5 billion of credit facility revolving and term loans, bears interest at floating interest rates based on USD-LIBOR. We expect to transition from LIBOR to another reference rate due to the expected cessation of the LIBOR reference rate. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that LIBOR for the primary LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023, and, until our credit facility is modified to provide for a specific benchmark replacement, it is unclear what rate will apply to such credit facility debt. Such transition could cause interest rates under our current or future debt agreements to perform differently than in the past or cause other unanticipated and adverse consequences. 

Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and other government regulations can be costly.  

Our hotels are subject to various other forms of regulation, including Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), building codes and regulations pertaining to fire and life safety. Under the ADA, all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal rules related to access and use by disabled persons and we incur capital expenditures to make our hotels accessible. In addition, we have committed to provide, and certain local laws and contracts between our hotel managers and hotel workers’ unions require our hotels to provide, our managers’ employees with safety devices, sometimes known as “panic buttons.” We fund the capital necessary to ensure that employees at our hotels will be equipped with these safety devices. These and other laws and regulations may be changed from time-to-time, or new regulations adopted, resulting in additional costs of compliance, including potential litigation. A determination that we are not in compliance with these laws and regulations could result in a court order to bring the hotel into compliance, imposition of civil penalties in cases brought by the Justice Department, or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. Compliance with these laws and regulations could require substantial capital expenditures. Any increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the operations of our foreign hotels are subject to a variety of United States and international laws and regulations, including the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws, but we cannot assure that we will continue to be found to be operating in compliance with, or be able to detect violations of, any such laws or regulations.  

Litigation judgments or settlements could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition.  

We are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business and are defending these claims vigorously; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of current proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any period, depending, in part, upon the quantum of our operating results for such period. We also could become the subject of future claims by the operators of our hotels, individuals or companies who use our hotels, our investors, our joint venture partners or regulating entities and these claims could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  

Environmental liabilities are possible and can be costly.  

Our hotels are subject to requirements and potential liabilities under various foreign and U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations. Unidentified environmental liabilities could arise and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and performance. Additionally, even after we have sold a hotel, we may be liable for environmental liabilities that occurred during our ownership. Federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at the property. The owner or operator may be required to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by the parties in connection with the contamination. These laws typically impose clean-up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants. Even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination, each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all the clean-up costs incurred. In addition, third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site. Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of toxic or hazardous substances. These laws require that owners or operators of buildings properly manage and maintain these substances and notify and train those who may come into contact with them and undertake special precautions. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators who fail to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to toxic or hazardous materials.

Market for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Host Inc.  

Host Inc.’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and trades under the symbol “HST.”  

As of February 19, 2021, there were 17,108 holders of record of Host Inc.’s common stock. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are considerably more beneficial owners of our common stock than record holders. As of February 19, 2021, there were 1,171 limited partners of Host L.P. (in addition to Host Inc.). OP units are redeemable for cash, or, at our election, for Host Inc. common stock. However, under the terms of our credit facility amendment, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock.

Fourth Quarter 2020 Host Inc. Purchases of Equity Securities  

On February 22, 2017, Host Inc. announced a program to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock and on August 5, 2019, we announced an increase in the repurchase program from $500 million to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions, and repurchases may be made in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options and similar transactions, and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares or any specific dollar amount and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. We currently are restricted from repurchasing our common stock by our credit facility amendment, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition.”

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the same period in 2018, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 25, 2020.  

Overview  

Host Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2020. The remainder of Host L.P.’s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control.  

Host Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT’s composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 19, 2021, we own 80 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 10 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations.  

Our customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 64%, 30%, and 6%, respectively, of our 2020 room sales. By comparison, our 2019 room sales consisted of 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, for transient business, group business and contract business. Transient business broadly represents individual business and leisure travelers. Business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels. Therefore, we will be significantly more affected by trends in business travel than by trends in leisure demand. However, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, demand during the period April 2020 to present has primarily been driven by leisure customers. For a discussion of our customer categories, see “Item 1 Business – Our Customers”.  

COVID-19 Impact and Response. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely impacted U.S. and global economic activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets beginning in the first quarter of 2020. The adverse economic impact continues as various restrictive measures remain in place in many jurisdictions where we own hotels, including quarantines, restrictions on travel, school closings, limitations on the size of gatherings and/or restrictions on types of business that may continue to operate. As a result, the pandemic continues to negatively impact almost every industry directly or indirectly, including having a severe impact on the U.S. lodging industry generally and our company specifically. The ongoing effects of the pandemic on our operations and future bookings have had, and will continue to have, a material negative impact on our financial results and cash flows, and such negative impact may continue well after restrictive measures imposed by federal, state, local and other governmental authorities to contain the outbreak have been lifted.  

We have not filed for any relief under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act); however, several of our operators, including Hyatt and Marriott, have filed for the Employee Retention Credit (“ERC”) to partially offset the costs of their furloughed hotel employees under Title II of the CARES Act, as discussed below. Benefits received by our operators from the ERC related to employees at our hotels ultimately will benefit us as we bear the expense for the wages and benefits of all persons working at our hotels. 

In response to the pandemic, we and our managers, as applicable, have taken the following actions: 

•  

As of February 19, 2021, reopened 31 of the 35 hotels that had suspended operations at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will maintain operations or reopen a property when it is anticipated to generate revenue greater than the incremental costs associated with staying open;  

•  

Average monthly occupancy (which includes the results of hotels with suspended operations) has increased during the pandemic from 6.9% in April to 17.3% in December, due primarily to increased demand in drive-to leisure markets; 

•  

Working with our hotel managers, we implemented portfolio-wide cost reductions, including significantly reducing staffing levels by furloughing or severing a substantial portion of the hotel workforce, reduced shared services fees, suspended food and beverage outlet operations, closed guestroom floors and meeting space, and temporarily suspended brand standards. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction of hotel operating costs across the portfolio by over 50% for the year, excluding severance, compared to 2019. We expect that certain initiatives, including modernized brand standards,  

33 

streamlined operating departments and accelerated adoption of cost-saving technologies, may lead to long-term expense reductions over time; 

•  

Paid health benefits of approximately $112 million during the year for hotel employees furloughed by our managers and special pay and accrued $13 million at year-end for similar payments to be made in the first quarter of 2021. A portion of the furlough costs has been offset by ERC of approximately $39 million recorded for the year. We also recorded $65 million during the year for hotel-level severance costs;  

•  

Suspended contributions to our hotels’ FF&E escrow accounts and suspended or deferred non-essential capital projects, which reduced full year 2020 capital expenditures by over $100 million compared to the forecast range as reported in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K;  

•  

Successfully amended the credit agreement governing our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility and two $500 million term loans. Under the amendments, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022, with certain financial covenants modified through the third quarter of 2023;  

•  

Accessed the full $1.5 billion under the revolver portion of the credit facility as a precautionary measure in order to increase our cash position and preserve financial flexibility in light of continued uncertainty in the global markets;  

•  

Suspended regular quarterly common cash dividends and stock repurchases until further notice. All future dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors; and 

•  

Reduced corporate expenses by approximately 16.8% for the year compared to 2019, through reduced travel, compensation and other overhead. 

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company remains fluid, as does our corporate and property-level response, together with the response of our hotel operators. There remains a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the timing for widespread availability of vaccines and, as a result, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic remains difficult to predict. We, and our hotel managers, may take additional actions in response to future developments.  

Understanding Our Performance  

Our Revenues and Expenses. Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation).  

Operations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 99% of our total revenues and 1% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenues:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

34 

Hotel operating expenses represent approximately 97% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 59% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.  

Key Performance Indicators. The following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITS: 

•  

hotel occupancy is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold; 

•  

average daily rate (“ADR”) is a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold;  

•  

revenues per available room (“RevPAR”) is used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and 

•  

total revenues per available room (“Total RevPAR”) is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR.  

RevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by  

35 

increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.  

We also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Our non-GAAP financial measures include:  

•  

NAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. We use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business.  

•  

All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA. All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We use All Owned Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our hotels.  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

In discussing our operating results, we typically present RevPAR and certain other financial data on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between years. For this reason, we are temporarily suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or 2020; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. We also present RevPAR separately for our consolidated domestic and foreign (both on a nominal and constant dollar basis) hotels. We provide RevPAR results in constant currency due to the consolidated hotels that we own in Canada and Brazil and the effect that exchange rates have on our reporting. We use constant currency because we believe it is useful to investors as it provides clarity on how the hotels are performing in their local markets. For all other measures (net income, operating profit, EBITDA, FFO, etc.), our discussion refers to nominal US$, which is consistent with the presentation of our financial statements under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). 

Summary of 2020 Operating Results  

The following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):

(1)  

EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and all owned hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. Beginning in 2020, we changed our definition of Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted NAREIT FFO to exclude non-ordinary course severance costs, and remove these severance costs from property level operating results, which we believe provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. Furlough costs, which are viewed as a replacement to wages, will continue to be included in these metrics. Including these severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted NAREIT FFO would have been $(233) and $(184), respectively. Including severance costs, our All Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA would have been $(202) million. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures.   

N/M = Not meaningful. 

Revenues  

Total revenues declined $3,849 million, or 70.4%, compared to 2019, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as we experienced a sharp decline in group, business and leisure travel beginning in mid-March 2020. An overall decline in travel as well as the postponement or cancellation of conventions and conferences, music and arts festivals, sporting events and other large public gatherings and on-going travel restrictions have significantly reduced demand at our hotels. All owned hotel pro forma RevPAR decreased 70.3% compared to 2019, on a constant US$ basis, due to a 5,260 basis point decline in occupancy to 26.0%. All owned hotel pro forma Total RevPAR decreased 69.4% for the year as food and beverage revenues also experienced significant declines due to the decline in occupancy. (see “Statement of Operations Results and Trends”).  

Following RevPAR increases in January and February 2020 across the majority of the portfolio, we experienced unprecedented occupancy declines in the second quarter, followed by modest sequential improvements in the third and fourth quarters. The incremental quarterly improvement in the second half of the year was driven by increased demand in drive-to leisure markets. As a result, all owned hotel Total RevPAR in our Florida Gulf Coast, Jacksonville and Miami markets declined the least during the year, with decreases of 40.6%, 46.1% and 46.6%, respectively, due primarily to short-term leisure demand in the second half of the year. All owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Phoenix properties declined 51.1% during the year, also benefiting from leisure business, which led to strong golf revenues at two of our properties in that market, while all owned hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui/Oahu properties declined 69.6%, with operations suspended for three of our hotels through the third quarter followed by hotel reopenings and loosening travel restrictions in the fourth quarter. Our hotels in San Francisco/San Jose and New York, our two largest markets by room count, experienced declines in all owned hotel Total RevPAR of 74.5% and 80.3%, respectively, due to suspension of operations for a portion of the year at several of these hotels. The largest all owned hotel Total RevPAR declines occurred in our Boston and Chicago markets, with decreases of 84.8% and 82.7%, respectively, as operations remain suspended at the Sheraton Boston Hotel and the Westin Chicago River North.  

Operating Profit 

Operating profit margins (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) declined in 2020 to (58.8)% due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit margins under GAAP also are affected significantly by several items, including dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our all owned hotel pro forma EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined to (8.5)% for the year.

Net income for Host Inc. decreased $1,673 million in 2020 to a loss of $741 million primarily due to the decline in operations from the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as a $132 million decrease in other gains/(losses), consisting primarily of lower gain on sale of assets in 2020 as compared to 2019. These results led to a diluted loss per common share for Host Inc. of $1.04. Adjusted EBITDAre, which excludes, among other items, gain on sale of assets, impairment expense and severance expense, decreased to $(168) million for the year, while Adjusted FFO per diluted share, which excludes gain on sale of assets and other real estate transactions, including depreciation, impairment and severance, decreased to $(0.17) in 2020. 

The trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P.  

2021 Outlook  

The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted macroeconomic and industry expectations for 2021. While economic growth and business investment are expected to accelerate meaningfully in 2021, supported by further stimulus, low interest rates, and vaccine distribution, government-imposed restrictions across the U.S. remain. Many regions continue to grapple with the early 2021 surge in outbreaks and new variants of the virus, which has resulted in elevated jobless claims and slower economic activity in the first part of the year. While forecasts for 2021 remain uncertain, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus currently estimates an increase in real GDP of 4.9% for the year, while business investment is anticipated to increase 6.8%. Though analysts believe the unemployment rate peaked in 2020, it is anticipated to remain elevated into 2021, with an expected average of 5.8% for the year. The range of potential outcomes on the economy and the lodging industry specifically is exceptionally wide, reflecting both the unprecedented nature of the pandemic and varying analyst assumptions surrounding infection rates, new virus variants and the timing of vaccine deployments. 

Hotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the long-term historical average in 2021, as social distancing measures and supply chain challenges resulted in project delays across the U.S. A large percentage of U.S. hotels closed temporarily in 2020, and while many have begun to reopen, we anticipate that the number of permanent hotel closures will be higher than historical averages. The pandemic’s outsized impact on our industry has resulted in a breakdown of the relationship between increased business investment and RevPAR growth. RevPAR recovery is anticipated to lag that of the broader U.S. economy, despite lower supply growth. Luxury and upper upscale hotels in top markets, where a majority of our hotels are located, have been most heavily affected by the pandemic, due in part to the sharp decline in air travel, particularly from international arrivals, and the slower recovery of corporate and group demand. While we have seen slightly improving trends, we anticipate that these factors will persist in 2021. 

As a result of the significant uncertainties related to the timing of vaccine deployment, further government stimulus and related policy, and resulting broader macroeconomic trends in 2021, we anticipate that the industry outlook will continue to be weighed down by the slow return of corporate and group travel, as businesses likely will remain cautious. While investor optimism has grown in the early part of 2021 as analysts focus on the potential for significant pent-up leisure demand, existing corporate policies are expected to continue to constrain nonessential business transient and group travel until the country approaches herd immunity. Given the unprecedented and unpredictable nature of the pandemic and its effect on our industry, we are not able to provide a full year forecast for RevPAR at this time. We believe that recovery within the lodging industry is highly dependent on the strength of the economy, consumer confidence and, especially with respect to corporate and group travel, the timing of vaccine deployment. Accordingly, we believe the recovery in 2021 likely will be gradual and that the impact on specific markets and industries will be uneven.  

As noted above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains highly uncertain. There can be no assurances as to the timing for a recovery in lodging demand for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, slower than anticipated return of group and business travel. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see Part 1 Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”  

Strategic Initiatives 

For 2021, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation in order to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise as a result of the pandemic. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit, including the pursuit of exiting the Brazil and Canada markets in order to focus on our domestic portfolio. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use.

Dispositions. We completed the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa in 2020 for net proceeds of approximately $202 million. Additionally, in transactions completed during the year, we sold a total of 38 acres of land adjacent to The Phoenician for $83 million.  

Financing transactions. Senior Notes. On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes, for total proceeds of approximately $733 million, net of discounts, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series I senior Notes have been designated as green bonds, as an amount equal to the net proceeds will be allocated to eligible green projects. A portion of the proceeds were used in August 2020 to repay approximately 81% of the outstanding 4.75% Series C senior notes due 2023 for $390 million, including $26 million of prepayment costs. Additionally, the remaining $86 million of Series C senior notes were redeemed in December 2020 for $94 million, including a premium of approximately $8 million. This eliminated the final series of senior notes issued before we attained an investment grade rating, and therefore any covenants or restrictions under our non-investment grade senior notes indentures no longer are applicable. 

Credit Facility. During the year, we had a net draw of $1,483 million under the revolver portion of our credit facility. Additionally, in June 2020 and February 2021, we amended the terms of our credit facility, under which the quarterly-tested financial maintenance covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. Following the covenant waiver period, certain financial maintenance covenants are modified through the third quarter of 2023. 

We believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. Through our transactions in 2020, we were able to lower our weighted average interest rate to 3.0% at December 31, 2020, compared to 3.8% at December 31, 2019, and extended our weighted average debt maturity to 5.0 years. We have a debt balance of $5.5 billion and no significant debt maturities until 2023. 

For a detailed discussion, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Capital Projects. We continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2020, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures, of which $343 million represented return on investment (“ROI”) capital expenditures and $156 million represented renewal and replacement projects.  

In collaboration with Marriott, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2018 on an initial 17 properties, now 16 properties following the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, that is expected to occur over a four-year period. We believe these investments will make these hotels more competitive in their respective markets and will enhance long-term performance through increases in RevPAR and market yield index. To accelerate this process, we agreed to invest amounts in excess of the FF&E reserves required under our management agreements, or approximately an average of $175 million per year, which amounts are included in the forecast range of 2021 capital expenditures reflected below. In exchange, Marriott has provided additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees of $83 million, before reductions for incentive management fees, over the four years to offset expected business disruption.  

Of the 16 properties included in the program, we substantially completed the projects at the Coronado Island Marriott Resort & Spa, New York Marriott Downtown, San Francisco Marriott Marquis, and Santa Clara Marriott in 2019 and projects at the Minneapolis Marriott City Center, San Antonio Marriott Rivercenter and JW Marriott Atlanta Buckhead in 2020. Work is underway at seven other properties. Approximately 65% of the total estimated costs of the transformational capital program have been spent as of December 31, 2020 and, in 2021, we expect to substantially complete four additional properties, including: The Ritz-Carlton Amelia Island, New York Marriott Marquis, Houston Medical Center Marriott and Orlando World Center Marriott.  

In 2021, we also have several projects scheduled to be completed or initiated that seek to add value to our existing portfolio over time. These include: 

•  

AC Hotel Scottsdale North – using an underutilized parking lot alongside The Westin Kierland Resort & Spa, we developed a 165-room select-service hotel branded as an AC by Marriott. The hotel was substantially completed in 2020 and opened in January 2021;  

•  

Additional villas at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort – development and construction of 19 additional two-bedroom, luxury villas at the Andaz Maui is underway and expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2021;  

39 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

•  

Expansions at the Orlando World Center Marriott – development and construction of a 2.3-acre waterpark and a 60,000 gross square-foot meeting space expansion is underway and is expected to be completed in the first half of 2022; and 

•  

 The Ritz-Carlton Naples - a tower expansion and extensive guestroom renovation that will increase the number of suites at the property are scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2021, paired with the redevelopment of public and meeting space, including the addition of a new pool and cabanas to begin in 2022, with all projects expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. 

For 2021, we expect to make capital expenditures of $375 million to $475 million, including approximately $110 million to $140 million for the Marriott transformational capital program discussed above, which is expected to be nearly 85% complete by year-end 2021. We received approximately $19 million in operating profit guarantees in 2020 from Marriott and expect to receive approximately $16 million in 2021. The total expected capital spend consists of $275 million to $325 million of ROI projects and $100 million to $150 million of renewal and replacement projects. We have established key milestones to review major projects prior to implementation, with the ability to reduce 2021 capital expenditures by approximately $150 million, if required, to conserve cash. 

Share Repurchases and Dividends. On August 5, 2019, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized an increase in its share repurchase program from $500 million to $1 billion. In the first quarter of 2020, we repurchased 8.9 million common shares at an average price of $16.49 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $147 million, prior to suspending our repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, we had $371 million available for repurchase under the program. Repurchases are currently restricted under the terms of our credit facility amendment.  

During 2020, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.20 per share in the first quarter, with respect to Host Inc.’s common stock. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.2042988 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2020. As part of its response to COVID-19 and in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility, Host suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend commencing with the second quarter dividend that would have been paid in July 2020.  

There can be no assurances as to when dividends will be restored but, based on the terms of the credit facility amendments, we are restricted to paying a quarterly common cash dividend of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, until after the covenant waiver period expires following the second quarter of 2022. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. However, while the dividend is suspended to preserve cash and liquidity, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.

Statement of Operations Results and Trends  

The following table presents revenues in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

The significant decline in revenues was due predominantly to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began to significantly impact hotel operations beginning in March of 2020. After a significant decline in revenues in the second quarter, revenues gradually improved through subsequent quarters, although they remained well below historical levels. Our 2020 revenues on a quarterly basis were as follows: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Rooms. Total rooms revenues decreased $2,455 million, or 71.6%, in 2020. Rooms revenues in 2019 include $196 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019. 

Food and beverage. Total F&B revenues decreased $1,221 million, or 74.1%, in 2020. F&B revenues in 2019 include $77 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019. 

Other revenues. Total other revenues decreased $173 million, or 44.2%, in 2019. Attrition and cancelation fees increased $3 million compared to 2019. Other revenues in 2019 include $26 million of revenues for hotels sold in 2020 and 2019.

Property-level Operating Expenses  

The following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP for the two years ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except percentages):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Our operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet and audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 59% of these expenses in any year. During 2020, these expenses declined 54% compared to 2019, excluding the severance expense discussed below. Included in these amounts in 2020 is $125 million for benefits to hotel employees who were furloughed by our managers and special pay, partially offset by approximately $39 million related to the ERC recorded by our managers. We also recorded $65 million of severance costs in 2020, which has been excluded from the wage and benefit discussions below. Other property-level expenses consist of property taxes, which are highly dependent on local taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.  

The decline in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees predominantly are due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as follows: 

Rooms. Rooms expenses decreased $511 million, or 58.5%, during 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 71% of our 2020 rooms expenses and 66% of our 2019 rooms expenses. 

Food and beverage. F&B expenses decreased $700 million, or 62.5%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 74% of our 2020 F&B expenses and 70% of our 2019 F&B expenses. 

Other departmental and support expenses. Other departmental and support expenses decreased $609 million, or 47.0%, in 2020. Wages and benefits represented approximately 44% of our 2020 other departmental and support expenses and 41% of our 2019 other departmental and support expenses. 

Management fees. Total management fees decreased $200 million, or 83.7%, in 2020. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, decreased $119 million, or 72.1%, compared to 2019. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $91 million, as we did not pay incentive management fees during 2020. 

Other property-level expenses. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses decreased $53 million, or 14.5%, in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in rent on a portion of our ground leases that are based on a percentage of sales. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott under the transformational capital program in both 2020 and 2019. 

Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $11 million, or 1.6%, to $665 million in 2020, due to impairment expense that was recorded in 2019.  

42 

Other Income and Expenses  

Corporate and other expenses. Corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

General and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. In 2020, corporate and other expenses declined by approximately 17% compared to 2019, as a result of reduced compensation, travel and other overhead. In 2019, corporate and other expenses include costs associated with a significant transformation of our corporate information systems platform, the implementation of which was completed in the second quarter of 2019. 

Gain on insurance and business interruption settlements. In 2019, we received $27 million of property insurance proceeds related to Hurricane Irma, that occurred in 2017, resulting in a gain of $4 million.  

Interest income. Interest income decreased $24 million, or 75.0%, in 2020 due to a decline in interest rates.  

Interest expense. Interest expense decreased $28 million, or 12.6%, in 2020 as compared to 2019, reflecting the benefits from refinancing activities in 2019 and 2020 as well as a decline in floating interest rates, which was partially offset by increased principal balances outstanding due to the credit facility draw. Interest expense for 2020 also reflects less prepayment premiums on the repayment of the Series C senior notes compared to the prepayment premiums paid in 2019 on the Series Z and Series B senior notes. The following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions): 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

Total cash interest expense paid was $183 million and $219 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes an increase (decrease) due to the change in accrued interest of $(2) million and $9 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Incremental interest expense reflects the cash interest expense for refinanced debt subsequent to the issuance of the new financing and prior to the repayment of the refinanced debt.  

Other gains/(losses). The following table presents the gains recognized on the sale of assets and other (in millions):

Equity in earnings (losses) of affiliates. In 2020, we recorded a loss of $30 million related to our unconsolidated investments. This included a $14 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, in addition to operating losses incurred by our investments. In 2019, we recorded earnings of $14 million from our unconsolidated investments. 

Benefit (provision) for income taxes. We lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2020, we recorded an income tax benefit of $220 million due primarily to the domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act, such domestic net operating loss may be carried back up to five years in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. Any domestic net operating loss incurred by our TRS not carried back pursuant to these rules may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof of 80% of annual taxable income. We expect to generate additional net operating losses from our TRS in 2021 and we will evaluate whether or not to record an income tax benefit for all or a portion of such net operating loss at that time. The 2019 income tax provision of $30 million primarily related to hotel operations at our TRS. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Income Taxes” for a discussion of our income taxes. 

Hotel RevPAR Overview 

To facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics for the periods included in this presentation on a comparable hotel basis. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we are revising our presentation to instead present pro forma hotel operating results for all hotels. See “All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics” for a complete description of our methodology. We also discuss our Hotel RevPAR results by geographic location and mix of business (i.e., transient, group, or contract).

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.  

Overview. We look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and it positions us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, none of our consolidated hotels are encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We were able to take further steps in 2020 to bolster our liquidity position as outlined below.  

Under the current challenging operating environment posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to preserve liquidity by drawing on our credit facility, working with our hotel operators to reduce operating costs at the hotel, reducing corporate level expenses, suspending our quarterly dividend and stock repurchases and deferring certain capital expenditures projects to future years. These actions contributed to lowering our cash used in operating activities each quarter following the beginning of the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund negative operations at our hotels, corporate expenses and reduced levels of capital expenditures. However, we also are well positioned to execute acquisitions to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise. 

46 

Despite the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, we believe that we have sufficient liquidity to withstand the current decline in operating cash flow and to fund our capital expenditures programs. We may access equity markets if favorable conditions exist in order to enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs, including to fund acquisitions or other investment opportunities generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The following summarizes the change in cash flows from 2019 to 2020 for significant items that affected our cash balance and reflects our actions to preserve financial liquidity: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash Requirements. We use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. Our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2021 are approximately $32 million. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. Our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 91 years, while other operating obligations are generally short term in nature. We have no significant debt maturities until 2023.  

In addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $375 million to $475 million in 2021, but have the ability to reduce this spend by approximately $150 million if required to conserve cash. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project.  

As a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. As part of our COVID-19 response, our regular quarterly common cash dividend currently is suspended and we are restricted from repurchasing stock or OP Units under the terms of our credit facility amendment as discussed below. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies” for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees. 

Capital Resources. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2,335 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $139 million in our FF&E escrow reserve. We have substantially utilized the $1.5 billion revolver under our credit facility to increase our liquidity in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the near term, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our capital expenditures program, debt payments, operating and corporate costs, primarily with our existing cash reserves due to the negative operating cash from operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2020 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations, even if our hotel operations remain at current negative operating levels.  

We depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility (including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments) is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. Following the amendments of our credit facility agreement discussed below, the quarterly-tested financial covenants were waived beginning July 1, 2020 until the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022. However, we currently are below the interest coverage ratio required under our senior notes indentures to incur additional debt and, while not an event of default, we will be unable to incur additional debt while we remain below the required covenant level. 

47 

Given the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2021, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously.  

In February 2017, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase up to $500 million of Host Inc. common stock, and on August 5, 2019, authorized an increase in the program to $1 billion. The common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. Under the terms of our credit facility amendment in 2020, we currently are restricted from repurchasing stock. 

We continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from sales of hotels, but also potentially from equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or available cash. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.  

Sources and Uses of Cash. In 2020, our primary sources of cash included proceeds from the issuance of debt, draws on our credit facility revolver and dispositions. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, repurchases of common stock and distributions to equity holders. We do not anticipate significant cash from operations in 2021 and we are restricted from issuing debt under the covenants of our senior notes indenture. However, we have significant available cash and also have access to stock issuances and property dispositions as alternative sources of cash. Primary uses of cash are expected to include continued funding of operating shortfalls at our properties, interest and other corporate expenses and capital expenditures. Subject to market conditions, other uses of cash may include property acquisitions or other investments. 

Cash Provided by/Used in Operations. Our net cash used in operations for 2020 was $307 million compared to cash provided by operations in 2019 of $1,250 million due primarily to the decline in operations at our properties due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to fund operating shortfalls at our properties. In the first quarter of 2020, our portfolio provided cash from operations due to positive operating results in January and February. However, beginning with the second quarter, we experienced significant cash outflows from operating activities which continued through the second half of the year. However, net cash used in operations did decrease in each sequential quarter as a result of reducing operating costs at our hotels and the slightly improving levels of operations. The following presents the net cash provided by (used in) operating activities for each quarter in 2020: 

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities. Approximately $195 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2020 compared to $58 million provided in 2019. In addition to the acquisition and disposition activity detailed in the charts below, we spent approximately $499 million on capital expenditures in 2020, compared to $558 million in 2019. These amounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $12 million, $12 million and $11 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1,231 million for 2020, as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $1,315 million in 2019. Cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily consisted of the issuance of $750 million of 3.5% Series I senior notes and a draw on the credit facility, while 2019 included the issuance of $650 million of senior notes. Cash used in financing activities in 2020 included the repayment of the Series C senior notes, with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of the Series I senior notes, and the redemption of preferred OP units and cash used in 2019 included the repayment of senior notes. While cash used in 2020 and 2019 both included stock repurchases and dividend payments, payments in 2020 for these items were $638 million lower compared to 2019, as we suspended dividends and repurchases in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Senior Notes. On August 20, 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of $600 million aggregate principal amount of 3.5% Series I senior notes and on September 3, 2020, we completed the issuance of an additional $150 million aggregate principal amount of Series I senior notes. The proceeds were used to make a tender offer for our Series C senior notes and to improve our liquidity position in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Series I senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the September 15, 2030 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series I senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes. 

The following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P., to which we refer collectively as the senior notes indenture. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees to the senior notes. 

All of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2020 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. 

Under the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.’s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is based on Host L.P.’s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt.  

The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2020:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

51 

We are in compliance with certain of the financial ratios applicable to our senior notes as of December 31, 2020, but we fell below the 1.5x requirement for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio starting as of the end of the third quarter of 2020 and, as a result, while not in default, we will not be able to incur additional debt while the ratio remains below this requirement. We expect to continue to be below the 1.5x interest coverage ratio and hence will be unable to incur additional debt until operations substantially improve from current levels. 

Credit Facility. On August 1, 2019, we entered into the fifth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion (which is substantially fully utilized). The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions. 

The revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of up to two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 11, 2024, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 9, 2025, which date may not be extended.  

Neither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity, other than those required during the Covenant Relief Period as set forth below. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).  

Guarantees. Similar to our senior note indentures, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees. 

Prepayments. Voluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty.  

Financial Covenants. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. Except as set forth below during the Covenant Relief Period, these calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at issuance of a loan in order to establish its fair value and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance.  

Amendments. On June 26, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit facility and on February 9, 2021, we entered into a second amendment to the credit facility (collectively, the “Amendments”). The Amendments suspend requirements to comply with all existing financial maintenance covenants under the credit facility for the period which began on July 1, 2020 and ending on the required financial statement reporting date for the second quarter of 2022 (such period, the “Covenant Relief Period”). The existing financial maintenance covenants are reinstated for the quarter ending June 30, 2022, except that after the reinstatement instead of using the prior four calendar quarters’ results in the calculations, only results for the second quarter of 2022 and thereafter are used during a phase in period. In addition, for the second quarter of 2022, the only financial covenant that shall be required to be satisfied shall be a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.00:1.00 as of the end of such quarter. For the fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period (i.e., after June 30, 2022), the financial covenant requirements set forth in the credit facility before the Amendments shall apply, except that the maximum leverage ratio requirement will be amended to be (a) 8.50:1:00 as at the end of the first and second fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (b) 8.00:1.00 as at the end of the third and fourth fiscal quarters ending after the Covenant Relief Period, (c) 7.50:1:00 as at the end of the fifth fiscal quarter ending after the Covenant Relief  

52 

Period and (d) 7.25:1.00 at all times thereafter.  The Amendments permit us to terminate the Covenant Relief Period at any time, subject to demonstrating satisfaction of the financial maintenance covenants that otherwise would apply for the quarter ending June 30, 2022. 

The Amendments also provide for, among other things:  

•  

an increase in the interest rate applicable to outstanding borrowings during the Covenant Relief Period, with the rate being increased by 40 basis points to the applicable rate across the credit rating-based pricing grid determined according to our unsecured long-term debt rating;  

•  

the addition of a permanent LIBOR floor of 15 basis points applicable to borrowings under the revolver and the term facilities;  

•  

the addition of a minimum liquidity covenant, which requires a minimum liquidity level of $400,000,000 at the end of each calendar month until the end of the Covenant Relief Period (subject to potential increase in the case of any future acquisitions of hotels, but not to exceed $600 million); 

•  

during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on acquisitions which provide that we may make acquisitions including (i) property exchange transactions governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (ii) acquisitions of up to $7,500,000,000 funded by issuances of equity and (iii) acquisitions of up to $2,000,000,000 funded by existing liquidity and up to $500 million of asset sales as long as we maintain minimum total liquidity of up to $600,000,000, depending on the amount of the acquisition; we also may assume debt in acquisitions, if permitted under our senior notes indenture, provided that the debt to undepreciated real estate assets ratio shall not exceed 0.35:1.00 calculated on a pro forma basis; 

•  

during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on the ability to make distributions and repurchases or redemptions, with certain exceptions, including the ability to make distributions sufficient to allow for the payment of a quarterly common cash dividend by Host Inc. of $0.01 per share or higher amounts to the extent necessary to allow Host Inc. to maintain REIT status or to avoid corporate income or excise taxes, and annual distributions of up to $50 million for any preferred OP units which Host L.P. may issue;  

•  

during the Covenant Relief Period, additional limitations on debt incurrence such that we can incur indebtedness only if the incurrence is permitted under our senior notes indenture; 

•  

limitations on the ability to make stock repurchases or OP unit redemptions following the Covenant Relief Period if the Leverage Ratio exceeds 7.25:1.00, subject to certain exceptions;  

•  

limitations on the ability to make capital expenditures from the period beginning on the effective date and ending on March 31, 2022 (or any earlier date on which the Covenant Relief Period is terminated); during this period we can fund all emergency, life safety and ordinary course maintenance capital expenditures plus $950,000,000 in other capital expenditures, such as return on investment capital expenditures; and 

•  

a requirement during the Covenant Relief Period to apply the net cash proceeds in excess of $350,000,000 in the aggregate from asset sales and debt issuances (but not equity issuances) as a mandatory prepayment of amounts outstanding under the credit facility; the mandatory prepayment requirements for asset sales and debt issuances are subject to various exceptions, including, among other things, (1) the net cash proceeds of asset sales in an amount of up to $750,000,000 that are used in a property exchange transaction governed by Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code, (2) net cash proceeds up to $500 million of asset sales that are used to acquire assets unencumbered by debt, (3) the net cash proceeds of debt issuances constituting refinancing indebtedness, (4) certain indebtedness assumed in acquisitions and (5) other indebtedness up to $10,000,000. Following the issuance of the Series I Senior Notes and the sale of the Newport Beach Marriott Hotel & Spa, we have maximized the $350 million net cash proceeds capacity available to Host, and therefore future excess cash proceeds will be applied in accordance with the repayment terms of the Amendments unless they fit into one of the exceptions set forth above.  

In connection with each Amendment, we paid a consent fee of 7.5 basis points on the amount of each consenting lender’s commitments under the revolver and term facilities.

At December 31, 2020, the following table summarizes the results of the financial tests required by the credit facility, for informational purposes only, as the covenants are not currently in effect under the Amendments:  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

If at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio will be reduced to 1.5x.  

Interest and Fees. We pay interest on revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, the margin ranges from 77.5 to 145 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. We also pay a facility fee ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, we are able to borrow at a rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points and pay a facility fee of 25 basis points. Outside of the Covenant Relief Period, interest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 85 to 165 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). The Amendments also increased the applicable margin during the Covenant Relief Period by 40 basis points. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2020, our applicable margin on LIBOR loans under both term loans is 165 basis points.  

Borrowings under our revolver (currently $1.5 billion) and the $1 billion outstanding in term loans constitute our primary obligations denominated in LIBOR. The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR over time. On November 30, 2020, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board expressed support for a plan to cease publication of the one week and two month LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021, and the remaining LIBOR rates after June 30, 2023, and encouraged banks to transition away from LIBOR as soon as possible. Accordingly, it is highly likely that the LIBOR rates under our credit facility will be discontinued after June 2023. There currently is no definitive information regarding the future utilization of LIBOR or of any particular replacement rate. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital cannot yet be determined. Our credit facility provides that in the event LIBOR no longer is published, we and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, will amend the credit facility to provide for a comparable successor rate or, in the absence of an amendment, borrowings will be deemed converted to base rate borrowing at the higher of the federal funds rate plus ½ of 1% or the “prime rate” announced by Bank of America, N.A. 

Other Covenants and Events of Default. The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, and outside of the Covenant Waiver Period, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.  

The credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments automatically will terminate.  

Mortgage Debt of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures. We own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity method. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $145 million at December 31, 2020. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us. 

Distributions/Dividends. Host Inc.’s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. After paying its regular quarterly common cash dividend of $0.20 per share for the first quarter of 2020, Host Inc. suspended its regular quarterly common cash dividend in order to preserve cash and future financial flexibility in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. In addition, in connection with the amendments to the credit facility, we agreed to substantial limitations on our ability to pay common cash dividends during the Covenant Relief Period as discussed above.  

54 

Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2020, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit. During the Covenant Relief Period, all redemptions must be made with Host Inc. common stock. 

Investors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders.  

Counterparty Credit Risk. We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.  

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the following critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”:  

•  

Asset Acquisitions and Business Combinations; and 

•  

Property and Equipment – Impairment testing.  

All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results 

To facilitate a year-over-year comparison of our operations, we typically present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in this annual report on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects on operations, there is little comparability between periods. For this reason, we temporarily are suspending our comparable hotel presentation and instead present hotel operating results for all consolidated hotels and, to facilitate comparisons between periods, we are presenting results on a pro forma basis, including the following adjustments: (1) operating results are presented for all consolidated hotels owned as of December 31, 2020, but do not include the results of operations for properties sold in 2019 or through the reporting date; and (2) operating results for acquisitions in the current and prior year are reflected for full calendar years, to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results.  

Constant US$ and Nominal US$ 

Operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. For comparative purposes, we also present the RevPAR results for the prior year assuming the results of our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year, thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year-over-year comparisons. We believe that this presentation is useful to investors as it provides clarity with respect to the growth in RevPAR in the local currency of the hotel consistent with the manner in which we would evaluate our domestic portfolio. However, the effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual results of net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDAre, earnings per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. Nominal US$ results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation. 

55 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  

We use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) all owned hotel pro forma operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P.  

We calculate EBITDAre and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDAre and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDAre and FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDAre, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration and other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit.  

Similarly, EBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 hotels and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host LP held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre are calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance.  

EBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre  

EBITDA  

Earnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.  

EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre 

We present EBITDAre in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDAre as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDAre of unconsolidated affiliates. 

56 

We make additional adjustments to EBITDAre when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAre, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDAre also is similar to what is used in calculating certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDAre for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDAre:  

•  

Property Insurance Gains – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDAre is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets.  

•  

Acquisition Costs – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.  

•  

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. 

•  

Severance Expense – Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. 

In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDAre for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last such adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.  

The following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDAre, and Adjusted EBITDAre to net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:

Including severance costs, our Adjusted EBITDAre and Adjusted FFO would have been $(233) and $(184) million, respectively, for 2020.

FFO Measures  

We present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. Effective January 1, 2019, we adopted NAREIT’s definition of FFO included in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement. The adoption did not result in a change in the way we calculate NAREIT FFO. NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis. 

We believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. 

We also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:  

•  

Gains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs.  

•  

Acquisition Costs –Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company.  

•  

Litigation Gains and Losses – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.  

•  

Severance Expense – Effective for 2020, in certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business. 

In unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO. 

58 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income (loss), the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:

Earnings per diluted share and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling limited partners, exchangeable debt securities and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive.

All Owned Hotel Pro Forma Property Level Operating Results  

We present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a hotel-level pro forma basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our hotel results reflect the operating results of our hotels as discussed in “All Owned Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present all owned hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our hotels. All owned hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. While severance expense is not uncommon at the individual property level in the normal course of business, we eliminate from our hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.  

Because of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.  

While management believes that presentation of all owned hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on all owned hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe all owned hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.

Profit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount. GAAP operating profit margins are calculated using amounts presented in the consolidated statements of operations. Comparable hotel margins are calculated using amounts presented in the above table.  

(2)  

Including severance costs, our All Hotel Pro Forma EBITDA would have been $(202) million for 2020.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

All information in this section applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P.  

Interest Rate Sensitivity  

Our future income, cash flows and fair values with respect to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks. As of February 19, 2021, we do not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding. 

The interest payments on 55% of our debt are fixed in nature. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments, discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The senior notes are valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our earnings and cash flows by approximately $25 million in 2021. The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates (in millions, except percentages):  

 [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 

(1)  

The amounts are net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs; therefore, negative amounts prior to maturity represent the amortization of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs.  

(2)  

The interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of December 31, 2020. No adjustments are made for forecast changes in the rate. 

Exchange Rate Sensitivity  

We have currency exchange risk because of our hotel ownership in Brazil and Canada and our minority investment in a joint venture in India. We may utilize several strategies to mitigate the exposure of currency exchange risk for our portfolio, including (i) utilizing local currency denominated debt (including foreign currency draws on our credit facility), (ii) entering into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts, or (iii) investing through partnership and joint venture structures. For 2020 and 2019, revenues from our consolidated foreign operations were $20 million and $88 million, respectively, or approximately 1% and 2% of our total revenues, respectively. Over the past few years, we have strategically exited international markets, including the disposition of one hotel in Mexico in 2018 and one hotel in Australia in 2017. Additionally, in 2018, we sold our approximate 33% interest in the European joint venture. As a result, our prospective foreign currency exchange risk will have a minimal impact on our results of operations.  

We have two foreign currency forward purchase contracts, each with a notional amount of CAD 37 million ($28 million) that mature in March 2021. We also have a foreign currency forward purchase contract with a notional amount of CAD 25 million ($18 million) that matures in February 2021. The foreign currency exchange agreements into which we have entered strictly are to hedge foreign currency risk and are not for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of these contracts was approximately $4 million. These contracts are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) for contracts designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and through net income for contracts acting as a natural hedge of intercompany loans. The foreign currency forward sale contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement. Pursuant to these contracts, we will sell the foreign currency amount, as applicable, and receive the U.S. dollar amount on the forward sale date. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the derivatives.
