The Company has no material long-term purchase commitments with any of its suppliers, and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier.

Competition 

The retail industry is highly competitive. The Company’s operations compete with many retail formats on the national and local level, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers' outlets, off-price and discount stores, online retailers and catalogs, among others.

The Company’s stores are located in premier locations and the Company provides a superior omnichannel product experience at a variety of price points.

Human Capital 

Culture & Engagement  

At Macy’s culture is about relationships—how the Company serves and supports its customers, communities and employees (called colleagues). The Company’s workplace is rooted in equity and guided by its values of acceptance, respect, integrity and giving back.  

The Company gathers colleague feedback at key times throughout the colleague lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding, providing regular venues for colleagues to ask questions and share their opinions, such as Ask Me Anything sessions, town halls and employee resource groups. The Company formally solicits feedback from all colleagues twice a year through an enterprise-wide Culture Pulse Survey. The results are shared across the organization to provide visibility to both managers (called people leaders) and colleagues and help create an opportunity for open and constructive discussions among teams.  

Diversity & Inclusion  

Macy’s commitment to diversity and inclusion is guided by its values and starts from within by building a workforce that accurately represents the communities it serves at all levels and by cultivating a culture of belonging. The Company seeks to empower colleagues to harness and unleash the power of their individuality to help drive better business decisions for customers and shareholders.  

The Company actively promotes an inclusive and welcoming environment for all customers and is focused on diversity and inclusion beyond the organization—working to support and develop diverse suppliers; investing in economic and workforce development; contributing to organizations fighting for social justice; and awarding scholarships to cultivate future leaders. 

One of the Company’s measures to advance the diversity of its leadership at the senior director level and above is the MOSAIC program, a one-year professional development program launched in 2019 for its top talent at the manager and director levels who self-identify as ethnically diverse. From 2019 to 2020, approximately 61% of program participants were promoted or moved into a new role, with approximately 18% promoted to senior director level. The Company is currently at 24% ethnic diversity at the senior director level and above, with a goal to reach 25% in 2021 and 30% by 2025. 

Macy’s believes people leaders play an important role in driving performance and an inclusive culture. In 2020, the Company incorporated People Leader Commitments (which were launched in 2019) and diversity and inclusion (D&I) into the performance review process. In 2021, the Company has included standardized D&I goals into annual reviews at the director level and above.  

Company-sponsored, employee-led resource groups (ERGs) provide an opportunity for colleagues to experience connection, achieve belonging and build community. ERGs expanded from 51 to 94 chapters across Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s in 2020 and continue to be a resource for attracting and retaining talent. 

Macy’s D&I focus areas extend beyond its colleagues and include community, customers, marketing and suppliers. For example: 

•  

In 2020, the Company allocated $1 million to organizations promoting social justice, sourced new partners, and committed two colleagues to the work of CEO Action for Racial Equity Taskforce—the mission of the taskforce is to identify, develop and promote scalable and sustainable public policies and corporate engagement strategies that will address systemic racism, social justice and improve societal well-being.  

•  

In 2019, the Company launched a Customer Bill of Rights across all Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s stores as a new standard of how the Company will treat everyone who engages with its brands.  

•  

The Company is advancing representation in its advertising to reflect its customers by gender, gender identity, ethnicity, age, size and people with disabilities.  

•  

In 2020, the Company increased brand assortment by adding 100 new, diverse-owned businesses online and in stores. Overall, minority and diverse suppliers (retail and non-retail) accounted for 3.5% of the Company’s total spend in 2020, with a goal to increase to 4% in 2021.

Future of Work  

The workplace is evolving and so is Macy’s. The Company believes the future of work is about allowing colleagues to do their best work safely, flexibly and in an environment that inspires collaboration and connection and reflects their core values. Through investments in technology, new and updated policies and procedures, and listening to the needs of its colleagues, Macy’s is evolving with them. Because no matter where colleagues work, behind a desk or behind a screen, in stores or in distribution centers, the Company believes they are guided by their strong sense of culture and what it means to be part of the Macy’s family.  

The Company has taken enhanced safety measures to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 to colleagues and customers including requiring all customers to wear face masks in stores, enforcing social distancing guidelines, increasing safety equipment in stores, offering contactless shopping opportunities, providing company-supplied personal protection equipment and wellness checks for colleagues, and performing enhanced cleaning.  

Learning & Development 

Macy’s believes that learning goes hand in hand with career growth, personal satisfaction and outstanding results. The Company aspires to create a learning culture where colleagues actively learn, apply what they have learned to address business challenges and share their knowledge, including their mistakes, to help others grow. Learning is accessible through Ignite (powered by Degreed), the Company’s self-directed learning experience platform as well as through technology, social learning and meaningful experiences and exposures with colleagues.  

The Company makes investments in its people leaders and future leaders. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s Executive Development Programs offer immersive, hands-on learning experiences for recent college graduates from top universities across the U.S. to jump start a career in retail, with specialization in technology, digital, stores, merchandising, planning, human resources and credit and customer service. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s offer internships for college students and Bloomindale’s offers an early immersion program focused on providing experiential learning and career exposure to those who identify with underrepresented groups. Bluemercury’s Shooting Stars is a six-month mentorship program that empowers mentees to own their journey by creating a development plan, becoming an inclusive leader and leveraging resources to support their career aspirations. In 2019, Macy’s partnered with Parsons School of Design to launch Macy’s Fashion Academy - a custom executive education program designed to offer best-in-class development across all disciplines of its merchant talent. 

Approximately 81% of colleagues completed unconscious bias training in 2019 and approximately 96% of professional colleagues have utilized Ignite for personal and professional development. People leaders invest a minimum of 40 hours of leadership development each year. Professional colleagues participate in a 90-day onboarding experience with performance milestones, support resources and role-specific training.

Talent  

Macy’s employs approximately 90,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal colleagues nationwide across a variety of functions and roles. The Company is committed to having the best talent in retail – encouraging the continuous upskilling of its colleagues and empowering them to chart their own career paths, while staying focused on acquiring the best and brightest to inject fresh thinking. 

Total Rewards 

Macy’s offers comprehensive benefits and an awards strategy that recognizes performance and talent development. Eligible colleagues have varied medical plan options to meet individual needs. The Company’s commitment to colleagues’ well-being expanded during the pandemic in 2020, as it covered 100% of insurance premiums for colleagues while on furlough, including coverage for dependents. The Company provides paid time-off, parental leave and holiday pay as well as a company 401(k) plan and match, dependent care flexible spending account, colleague merchandise discount and tuition reimbursement for eligible colleagues. 

The Company believes that pay equity is fundamental to its culture and D&I strategy. Compensation is based on job position, responsibilities, experience and performance with incentive opportunities that allow all colleagues to share in the Company’s success.  

In 2021, the Company expects to achieve greater than 99% pay equity across gender and race. In terms of both base pay and total compensation, the Company expects to pay female colleagues at greater than 99% of what it pays male colleagues, and it expects that minorities will be paid at greater than 99% of what it pays non-minorities in the U.S. 

The Company informs its compensation approach through market surveys and pay ranges to ensure pay is competitive and fair and has a robust process to assess internal pay levels for consistency and fairness. The Company’s incentive programs reward colleagues across all levels and functions for achievements in driving business results and upholding its shared culture and values, including annual cash incentives for corporate colleagues based on performance, Path to Growth quarterly incentive program for frontline colleagues, spot bonuses and commissions for store colleagues, and annual equity grants to eligible senior management. 

Number of Employees 

As of January 30, 2021, excluding seasonal employees, Macy’s had 75,711 full-time and part-time employees. Because of the seasonal nature of the retail business, the number of employees peaks in the holiday season. Approximately 7% of employees are represented by unions.
