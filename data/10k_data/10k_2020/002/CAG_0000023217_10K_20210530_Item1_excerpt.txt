ITEM 1. BUSINESS 

General Development of Business 

Conagra Brands, Inc. (the "Company", "Conagra Brands", "we", "us", or "our"), headquartered in Chicago, is one of North America's leading branded food companies. Guided by an entrepreneurial spirit, the Company combines a rich heritage of making great food with a sharpened focus on innovation. The Company's portfolio is evolving to satisfy people's changing food preferences. Its iconic brands such as Birds Eye®, Duncan Hines®, Healthy Choice®, Marie Callender's®, Reddi-wip®, and Slim Jim®, as well as emerging brands, including Angie's® BOOMCHICKAPOP®, Duke's®, Earth Balance®, Gardein®, and Frontera®, offer choices for every occasion. 

We began as a Midwestern flour-milling company and entered other commodity-based businesses throughout our history. We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919 and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1976. Over time, we transformed into the branded, pure-play consumer packaged goods food company we are today. Growing our food businesses has also been fueled by innovation, organic growth of our brands, and expansion into adjacent categories, including through acquisitions. We are focused on delivering sustainable, profitable growth with strong and improving returns on our invested capital. 

On October 26, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc. ("Pinnacle"). As a result of the acquisition, Pinnacle became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Divestitures 

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the sale of our Egg Beaters® business for net proceeds of $50.6 million, subject to final working capital adjustments. The results of operations of the divested Egg Beaters® business were primarily included in our Refrigerated and Frozen segment, and to a lesser extent within our International and Foodservice segments, for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction. The assets and liabilities of this business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented prior to the divestiture. 

During the third quarter of fiscal 2021, we completed the sale of our Peter Pan® peanut butter business for net proceeds of $101.5 million, including working capital adjustments but subject to final adjustments for certain tax benefits. The business results were previously reported primarily within our Grocery & Snacks segment, and to a lesser extent within our International and Foodservice segments, for the periods preceding the completion of the transaction. The assets and liabilities of this business have been reclassified as assets and liabilities held for sale within our Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented prior to the divestiture. 

General 

The following comments pertain to all of our reporting segments. 

Conagra Brands is a branded consumer packaged goods food company that operates in many sectors of the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of branded, private branded, and value-added consumer food, as well as foodservice items and ingredients. We use many different raw materials, most of which are commodities. The prices paid for raw materials used in making our food generally reflect factors such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and generally available from numerous sources. From time to time, we have faced increased costs for many of our significant raw materials, packaging, and energy inputs. We seek to mitigate higher input costs through productivity and pricing initiatives and the use of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of forecasted future consumption. 

We experience intense competition for sales of our food items in our major markets. Our food items compete with widely advertised, well-known, branded food, as well as private branded and customized food items. Some of our competitors are larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service, brand recognition, and brand loyalty. 

Demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. For example, sales of frozen foods tend to be marginally higher during the winter months, seafood sales are highest during Lent, in advance of the Easter holiday, and production of certain of our products occurs seasonally, during or immediately following the purchase of agricultural crops. 

4 

We manufacture primarily for stock; we fill our customer orders from finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time to time are not significant. 

Our intellectual property rights, including our trademarks, licensing agreements, trade secrets, patents, and copyrights are of material importance to our business and we attempt to protect such rights by pursuing remedies available to us under trademark, copyright, trade secret, and patent laws, as well as entering into licensing, third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements, and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Some of our food items are sold under brands that have been licensed from others, including under the P.F. Chang’s®, Bertolli®, and Libby’s® trademarks. We also own certain intellectual property rights that are licensed to third parties, such as the Alexia® trademark. While many of these licensing arrangements are perpetual in nature, others must be periodically renegotiated or renewed pursuant to their terms. We also actively develop and maintain a portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 

Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state, local, and foreign government agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Labor. In particular, the processing, packaging, transportation, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, the health and safety of our employees, and the protection of the environment are each subject to governmental regulation. Additionally, we are subject to data privacy and security regulations, tax and securities regulations, accounting and reporting standards, and other financial laws and regulations. We believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations in all material respects and do not expect that continued compliance with such regulations will have a material effect upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position. 

Our largest customer, Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 26% of consolidated net sales for each of fiscal 2021 and 2020 and 24% of consolidated net sales for fiscal 2019. 

Human Capital Resources  

At Conagra, we believe that our employees are the driving force behind our success. We believe that the success and growth of our business depend in large part on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a diverse population of talented and high-performing employees at all levels of our organization. We leverage our six timeless values, which form the framework of our Company culture, to guide our approach to human capital management:  

•  

Integrity: Doing the right things and doing things right 

•  

External Focus: Centering on the consumer, customer, competitor, and investor 

•  

Broad-Mindedness: Seeking out and respecting varied perspectives, embracing collaboration, and assuming positive intent 

•  

Agility: Converting insights into action with the speed of an entrepreneur 

•  

Leadership by all: Simplifying, making decisions, inspiring others, and acting like an owner 

•  

Focus on results: Leveraging a "refuse-to-lose" obsession with impact and value creation 

We have developed key recruitment, development, and retention strategies and objectives that guide our human capital management approach. These strategies and objectives are advanced through a number of programs, policies, and initiatives, as described below. 

As of May 30, 2021, we had approximately 18,600 employees, primarily in the United States. Approximately 46% of our employees are parties to collective bargaining agreements. We believe our relationships with employees and their representative organizations are good. 

Safety and Health: The health and safety of our employees is our top priority. We are focused on maintaining a strong culture of safety, in which all employees commit to protecting themselves and their colleagues. During fiscal year 2021, our Occupational Safety & Health Administration Incident Rate was 2.00 incidents per 100 full-time workers, as compared to 1.69 incidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2020 and 2.28 incidents per 100 full-time workers in fiscal 2019. We compare our incident rate to that of the average for companies in the food manufacturing sector, as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  

5 

In each of the last three fiscal years, our incident rate has been below the industry average. Our health and safety team audits each of our facilities every two years to ensure compliance with safety regulations and corporate policies. The team documents the audit results and tracks corrective actions to ensure we hold ourselves accountable for providing a safe work environment. 

Beginning in February 2020 and over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, our senior leadership has relied on cross-functional teams (a COVID-19 pandemic team, Return to Office team, and Vaccine Preparedness team), to review and assess the evolving situation, and to recommend risk mitigation actions for the health and safety of our employees. In order to enhance the safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, these teams have recommended, and we have implemented, various measures, including the installation of physical barriers between employees; employee screening protocols; facility cleaning and sanitation protocols; policies on the use of personal protective equipment; and robust employee leave policies. We have also executed a phased return to office approach to enable in-person work for corporate personnel, implemented work-from-home initiatives for certain office personnel, and provided increased access to COVID-19 vaccines for production facilities and corporate locations. 

Diversity and Inclusion: We strive to nourish an inclusive culture that encourages openness, acceptance, and individual authenticity. We believe that an inclusive culture drives employee engagement. 

At Conagra, diversity is more than race, gender, sexual orientation, and disability. All backgrounds, perspectives, styles, and opinions are valued and belong at Conagra, and we harness the power of diversity and inclusion ("D&I") to accelerate innovation and growth and as key enablers of shareholder value creation. 

We approach diversity from the top-down, exemplified by our Board of Directors (the "Board") and our Senior Leadership Team: three of our 11 directors are racially/ethnically diverse, three of our 11 directors are women, and four of 10 members of our Senior Leadership Team are women. We believe that a diverse team with a variety of viewpoints adds value to our business decision making and innovation by encouraging and incorporating a variety of perspectives and experiences. 

During fiscal 2021, we launched numerous efforts to amplify our commitment to a diverse and inclusive workforce: 

•  

We established a Diversity and Inclusion Leadership Council (the "Council"), comprised of our Senior Leadership and Human Resource Diversity and Inclusion teams, to set our D&I strategy, track our D&I progress, and ensure execution of our D&I initiatives.  

•  

The Council refreshed the Company's D&I strategic plan during fiscal 2021, and declared a focus on recruiting, advocating for, and developing diverse talent. In each of these areas, we have multiple strategic initiatives underway. Core aspects of our strategy include building a strong entry-level pipeline; providing development opportunities for underrepresented groups, internal and external; and committing to develop and advance our talent along the way. Examples of recruitment, advocacy, and development initiatives launched during fiscal 2021 include the following:  

•  

In October 2020, we launched Conagra's inclusive leadership development program. Through the end of fiscal 2021, we have trained over 1,400 people managers in inclusive leadership practices. 

•  

In November 2020, we partnered with The Hatchery Chicago to create a twelve-week culinary internship program for individuals from underrepresented communities. 

•  

In May 2021, we announced a partnership with the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the Hispanic Scholarship Fund through which Conagra will make donations to each organization for college scholarships in an effort to ensure that black and brown students receive equitable access to higher education opportunities. Conagra employees will also actively engage with scholarship recipients to provide professional development opportunities. 

•  

Throughout fiscal 2021, the Human Resources Committee of our Board (the "HR Committee") received regular updates from management on our D&I progress. The HR Committee has embedded D&I into its standing agenda and intends to discuss the topic at every regularly scheduled meeting it holds in fiscal 2022. 

We also continue to provide diversity and inclusion training for employees to highlight issues that impact underrepresented communities and to reduce the effects of bias in the workplace. Our goal is to create a culture of belonging, where everyone can experience inclusion. We want to be a place where people trust and respect one another. While we value and embrace diversity, we also celebrate what we all have in common—our energy and passion for making great food and great brands.

Learning and Development: We believe that by enabling employee development, we better position Conagra to meet current and future business needs and increase employee retention. By providing employees with learning and development opportunities, we empower them to build knowledge and skills and feel fulfilled in their work at Conagra.  

We leverage a variety of processes to enable employee learning and development at Conagra: 

•  

Employees have access to a variety of learning tools at Conagra, covering a wide array of topics. Our office-based employees can also access thousands of learning modules on-demand at their desks. 

•  

Individual objectives are set each year, providing employees with clear expectations for their performance in the short-term. Regular performance evaluations provide employees with feedback and growth opportunities. 

•  

Salaried employees are encouraged to develop Individual Development Plans ("IDP"). IDPs serve as a personal action plan, under which employees engage with their manager in ongoing development conversations, so that long-term career goals and developmental activities can be reviewed. 

Compensation and Benefits: We offer competitive compensation and benefits to attract the best talent and to support the overall well-being of our employees. Through our holistic approach to benefits, we provide our employees with resources to help them thrive. We offer a wide range of benefits across areas such as health, family, finance, community, and time away, including healthcare and wellness benefits, adoption and surrogacy assistance, family care resources, a 401(k) plan, family leave, and paid time off. A more complete discussion of our approach to employee compensation and benefits can be found in our Proxy Statement for the 2021 Annual Shareholders' Meeting.
