Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should carefully read this entire report, including, without limitation, the following risk factors and the section of this annual report entitled “Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.” Any of the following factors could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently view as immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply, but other categories may also apply.

Risk Relating to Our Business

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption to the global economy, consumer spending and behavior, tourism and to financial markets. While the overall COVID-19 situation appears to be improving, we have not recovered to pre-COVID performance levels and our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if the virus worsens or mutates, if vaccination efforts are unsuccessful and/or if regions or countries take further actions to contain the virus (including additional extended lock-downs and travel restrictions), among others. The full extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our business and operating results will depend largely on future events outside of our control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the success of vaccination efforts, new information concerning the virus or variants of the virus, and actions different states, regions or countries may take to contain the virus (including extended lock-downs and travel restrictions), among others. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government orders and proactive decisions we have made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, at various points during the course of the pandemic we temporarily closed almost all of our retail stores globally and furloughed all of our retail store employees in North America and many of our retail personnel elsewhere for an extended time. We may face longer term store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our retail stores in the future, and government restrictions and health and safety measures (including social distancing protocols) may prevent us from opening or limit our ability to fully operate in the ordinary course, which could materially impact our financial results. We have also closed many of our corporate offices globally and have implemented a work-from-home policy for many of our corporate employees, which may also negatively affect productivity in, or otherwise result in disruptions to, parts of our business.

As a result of store closures and reduced consumer traffic caused by COVID-19, many of our wholesale customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, causing a reduction in the amount of merchandise purchased from us and our product licensing partners, an increase in order cancellations and/or the need to extend payment terms. Any or all of these measures could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, these actions could lead to larger outstanding accounts receivable balances, delays in collection of accounts receivable, increased expenses associated with collection efforts, increases in credit losses and reduced cash flows.

Furthermore, our supply chain may also be significantly negatively affected if the factories that produce our product, the distribution centers that manage and ship our inventory, or the operations of our third-party logistics and other service providers 

17
are disrupted, closed or experience worker shortages, which may result in disruptions and delays in product shipments and potentially higher costs.

In light of our retail store closures in response to government orders, mandates, guidelines and recommendations limiting business operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decisions by many of the retail centers in which we operate to close shopping centers, we took certain actions and may continue to take certain actions with respect to our lease obligations, including discontinuing rent payments, negotiating with landlords for rent abatement or other rent relief and terminating certain leases, which may subject us to legal, reputational and financial risks. We may also take further actions with respect to our lease obligations in the future, which may not be successful.

In addition, we expect that traffic to our retail stores (and department stores and other third-party retailers that sell our products) as they reopen will be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We further expect that consumer spending will be negatively affected by macroeconomic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including a continued high unemployment rate and an economic recession, which may impact our physical retail stores, our e-commerce business and third-party wholesale accounts. Any significant disruption in consumer traffic, consumer behavior and/or consumer spending at our retail stores, on our e-commerce sites and/or at third-party wholesale accounts following the pandemic would result in a decrease in sales and profits and otherwise materially impact our business and financial performance.

COVID-19 may also have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and cash flows. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities, and sufficient funds are not otherwise available to us from borrowings under our credit facility or other sources, we may not be able to cover our expenses, fund our other liquidity and working capital needs, or execute on our strategic initiatives which could significantly harm our business. Our insurance costs may also increase substantially in the future as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our retail stores are heavily dependent on the ability and desire of consumers to travel and shop and a decline in consumer traffic could have a negative effect on our comparable store sales and store profitability resulting in impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Reduced travel resulting from economic conditions, fuel shortages, increased fuel prices, travel restrictions, travel concerns and other circumstances, including adverse weather conditions, disease pandemics (including COVID-19), epidemics and other health-related concerns, war, terrorist attacks or the perceived threat of war or terrorist attacks could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly if such events impact our customers’ desire to travel to our retail stores. For example, social distancing measures and other restrictions imposed by governments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which have had and may continue to affect our customers’ ability and desire to travel to our stores, which in turn has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our store revenue.

In addition, other factors that could impact the success of our retail stores include: (i) the location of the mall or the location of a particular store within the mall; (ii) the other tenants occupying space at the mall; (iii) vacancies within the mall (including retailers that may not reopen post-COVID-19); (iv) stores and malls having to re-close due to personnel or customer illness or further government restrictions; (v) increased competition in areas where the malls are located; (vi) the amount of advertising and promotional dollars spent on attracting consumers to the malls; and (vii) a shift toward online shopping which may be exacerbated in light of COVID-19 even when stores reopen. A decline in consumer traffic could have a negative effect on our comparable store sales and/or average sales per square foot and store profitability. If our retail stores underperform due to declining consumer traffic or otherwise and our expected future cash flows of the related underlying retail store asset do not exceed such asset’s carrying value, we may incur store impairment charges. A decline in future comparable store sales and/or store profitability or failure to meet market expectations or the occurrence of impairment charges relating to our retail store fleet could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The long-term growth of our business depends on the successful execution of our strategic initiatives.

As part of our long-term strategy, we intend to grow our market share and revenue through the following initiatives:

•trendsetting and innovative product offerings;

•increased brand engagement;

•optimizing customer experience;

•investing in technology; and

•expanding our global presence.

18
We also intend to support the growth of Versace and Jimmy Choo sales through retail store openings and further developing each brand’s e-commerce and omni-channel presence, as well as expanding into the luxury accessories market. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute on these strategic initiatives.

If we are unable to execute on our strategic initiatives, including for reasons due to the challenges we face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

If we are unable to effectively execute our e-commerce business and provide a reliable digital experience for our customers, our reputation and operating results may be harmed.

While e-commerce still comprises a small portion of our net revenues, it has been our fastest growing business over the last several years, particularly in light of COVID-19 and retail store closures. The success of our e-commerce business depends, in part, on third parties and factors over which we have limited control, including changing consumer preferences and buying trends relating to e-commerce usage, both domestically and abroad, and promotional or other advertising initiatives employed by our wholesale customers or other third parties on their e-commerce sites. Any failure on our part, or on the part of our third-party digital partners, to provide attractive, reliable, secure and user-friendly e-commerce platforms could negatively impact our consumers’ shopping experience, resulting in reduced website traffic, diminished loyalty to our brands and lost sales. In addition, if due to COVID-19 or otherwise there is a shift in consumer behavior such that customers utilize e-commerce over traditional brick-and-mortar stores, sales from our retail stores and wholesale channels of distribution may decline.

The success of our business also depends on our ability to continue to develop and maintain a reliable digital experience for our customers. We strive to give our customers a seamless omni-channel experience both in stores and through digital technologies, such as computers, mobile phones, tablets, and other devices. We also use social media to interact with our customers and enhance their shopping experience. Our inability to develop and continuously improve our digital brand engagement could negatively affect our ability to compete with other brands, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we must keep up to date with competitive technology trends, including the use of new or improved technology, creative user interfaces and other e-commerce marketing tools such as paid search and mobile applications, among others, which may increase our costs and which may not succeed in increasing sales or attracting consumers. For example, it is possible that consumers may not sign up for our loyalty program at anticipated rates if they do not find the features and benefits compelling, and that we may not realize the benefits that we anticipate from these programs. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties might adversely affect the sales in our e-commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.

Additionally, the success of our e-commerce business and the satisfaction of our consumers depend on their timely receipt of our products. The efficient flow of our products requires that our company-operated and third-party operated distribution facilities have adequate capacity to support the current level of e-commerce operations and any anticipated increased levels that may follow from the growth of our e-commerce business. If we encounter difficulties with our distribution facilities or in our relationships with the third parties who operate the facilities, or if any such facilities were to shut down or be limited in capacity for any reason, including as a result of fire, other natural disaster, labor disruption, or pandemic (including as a consequence of public health directives, quarantine policies or social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), we could face shortages of inventory, and we could experience disruption or delay, or incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times for distributing our products to our consumers which could result in customer dissatisfaction. Any of these issues could have an adverse effect on our business and harm our reputation.

A substantial portion of our revenue is derived from a small number of large wholesale customers, and the loss of or decline in business from any of these wholesale customers could substantially reduce our total revenue.

A small number of our wholesale customers account for a significant portion of our sales. Revenue from our five largest wholesale customers represented 12% of our total revenue for Fiscal 2021 and 17% of our total revenue for Fiscal 2020. We do not have written agreements with any of our wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. As a result of store closures and reduced consumer traffic caused by COVID-19, many of our wholesale customers have experienced, and may continue to experience, liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, causing a reduction in the amount of merchandise purchased from us and our product licensing partners, an increase in order cancellations and/or the need to extend payment terms. Any or all of these measures could substantially reduce our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our profitability. In addition, these actions could lead to larger outstanding accounts receivable balances, delays in collection of accounts receivable, increased expenses associated with collection efforts, increase in excess inventory, increases in credit losses and reduced cash flows.

19
The retail industry has experienced a great deal of consolidation and other ownership changes over the past several years and a number of wholesale accounts were forced to file bankruptcy or undergo restructurings due to the impact of COVID-19 on their business. We expect that the risk of consolidation, bankruptcy, restructurings or reorganizations by department stores and other retailers will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. This could result in store closings by our wholesale customers, which would decrease the number of stores carrying our products, while the remaining stores may purchase a smaller amount of our products and/or may reduce the retail floor space designated for our brands. In addition, such consolidation, bankruptcy or other changes with respect to our wholesale customers could decrease our opportunities in the market, increase our reliance on a smaller number of large wholesale customers and decrease our negotiating strength with our wholesale customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Additionally, certain of our wholesale customers, particularly those located in the U.S., have become highly promotional and have aggressively marked down their merchandise. We expect that such markdowns may continue to be exacerbated because of the impact of COVID-19. Such promotional activity could negatively impact our business.

Acquisitions may not achieve intended benefits and may not be successfully integrated.

Our acquisitions of Versace and Jimmy Choo or any other entity that we may acquire may not perform as well as initially expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we are required to test goodwill, brand and any other intangible assets acquired as a result of acquisitions for impairment. For Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, the carrying value of goodwill and brand intangible value for Jimmy Choo exceeded its respective related fair value, requiring us to record impairment charges for the difference of $163 million and $351 million, respectively.

In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses into our own business, or achieve any expected cost savings or synergies from such integration or we may determine to limit the integration of our brands. In addition to the overarching and continued challenges resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the potential difficulties that we may face that could cause the results of our acquisitions to not be in line with our expectations include, among others:

•failure to implement our business plan for the combined business or to achieve anticipated revenue or profitability targets;

•delays or difficulties in completing the integration of acquired companies or assets;

•higher than expected costs, lower than expected cost savings and/or a need to allocate resources to manage unexpected operating difficulties;

•unanticipated issues in integrating logistics, information and other systems;

•unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations;

•retaining key customers, suppliers and employees;

•operating risks inherent in the acquired business and our business;

•diversion of the attention and resources of management and resource constraints;

•retaining and obtaining required regulatory approvals, licenses and permits;

•unanticipated changes in the combined business due to potential divestitures or other requirements imposed by antitrust regulators; 

•assumption of liabilities not identified in due diligence or other unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities; and

•the impact on our internal controls and compliance with the requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

Additionally, Jimmy Choo outsources its information technology, accounting and other back office activities to a third-party service provider. There are risks of relying on a third-party provider to perform these services, which may include experiencing operational challenges and incurring increased expenses, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, both within North America and internationally, and increased competition based on a number of factors could cause our profitability and/or gross margins to decline.

Our brands face intense competition from other accessories, footwear and apparel producers and retailers, including, primarily European and American international luxury brands. In addition, we face competition through third party distribution channels that sell our merchandise, such as e-commerce, department stores and specialty stores. Competition is based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, the following:

•anticipating and responding to changing consumer demands in a timely manner;

20
•establishing and maintaining favorable brand name recognition;

•determining and maintaining product quality;

•maintaining key employees;

•maintaining and growing market share;

•developing quality and differentiated products that appeal to consumers;

•establishing and maintaining acceptable relationships with retail customers;

•pricing products appropriately;

•providing appropriate service and support to retailers;

•optimizing retail and supply chain capabilities;

•determining size and location of retail and department store selling space; and

•protecting intellectual property.

In addition, some of our competitors may be significantly larger and more diversified than us and may have significantly greater financial, technological, manufacturing, sales, marketing and distribution resources than we do. Their capabilities in these areas may enable them to better withstand periodic downturns in the accessories, footwear and apparel industries (including those related to COVID-19), compete more effectively on the basis of price and production and more quickly develop new products. The general availability of manufacturing contractors and agents also allows new entrants easy access to the markets in which we compete, which may increase the number of our competitors and adversely affect our competitive position and our business. Any increased competition, or our failure to adequately address any of these competitive factors, could result in reduced revenues, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Competition, along with other factors such as consolidation, changes in consumer spending patterns and a highly promotional retail selling environment (including the impacts of COVID-19), could also result in significant pricing pressure. These factors may cause us to reduce our sales prices to our wholesale customers and retail consumers, which could cause our gross margins to decline if we are unable to appropriately manage inventory levels and/or otherwise offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. If our sales prices decline and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, our profitability may decline, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may not be able to respond to changing fashion and retail trends in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.

The accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to rapidly changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. We believe that our success is largely dependent on the images of our brands and ability to anticipate and respond promptly to changing consumer demands and fashion trends in the design, styling, production, merchandising and pricing of products. If we do not correctly gauge consumer needs and fashion trends and respond appropriately, consumers may not purchase our products and our brand names and the images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in fashion trends and consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular or trend-setting. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our brands, business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face risks associated with operating globally and our strategy to continue to expand internationally.

We operate on a global basis, with approximately 50% of our total revenue from operations outside of the U.S. during Fiscal 2021. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:

•political or civil unrest, including protests and other civil disruption;

•unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemic and epidemic diseases, including the COVID-19 pandemic and any variants thereof;

•economic instability and unsettled regional and global conflicts, which may negatively affect consumer spending by foreign tourists and local consumers in the various regions where we operate;

•laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments;

•potential negative consequences from changes in taxation policies; 

•natural disasters or other extreme weather events, including those attributed to climate change; and

•acts of terrorism, military actions or other conditions over which we have no control.

21
In addition, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) formally left the European Union (“EU”) on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”). The consequences of Brexit could result in increased regulatory and legal complexities and cause disruption and create uncertainty surrounding our business, including affecting our relationship with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees and resulting in increased costs from new or elevated customs duties or financial implications from operational challenges, trade or tax policies. Brexit has also contributed to volatility and uncertainty in global stock markets and currency exchange rates, and could adversely impact investor confidence and consumer spending, including on discretionary items and retail products such as ours.

Finally, if our international expansion plans are unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We sell our products at varying retail price points based on geographic location that yield different gross profit margins and we achieve different operating profit margins, depending on geographic region, due to a variety of factors including product mix, store size, occupancy costs, labor costs and retail pricing. Changes in any one or more of these factors could result in lower revenues, increased costs, and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. There are also some countries where we do not yet have significant operating experience, and in most of these countries we face established competitors with significantly more operating experience in those locations. Furthermore, consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends may differ in these countries and, as a result, sales of our product may not be successful, or the gross margins on those sales may not be in line with those we currently anticipate.

There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our business is subject to risks associated with importing products, and the imposition of additional duties, tariffs or trade restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

There are risks inherent to importing our products. Virtually all of our imported products are subject to duties which may impact the cost of such products. In addition, countries to which we ship our products may impose safeguard quotas to limit the quantity of products that may be imported. We rely on free trade agreements and other supply chain initiatives in order to maximize efficiencies relating to product importation. For example, we have historically received benefits from duty-free imports on certain products from certain countries pursuant to the U.S. Generalized System of Preferences ("GSP") program. The GSP program expired on December 31, 2020. If the GSP program is not renewed or otherwise made retroactive, we could experience significant additional duties and our gross margin could be negatively impacted. Additionally, we are subject to government regulations relating to importation activities, including related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") withhold release orders. The imposition of taxes, duties and quotas, the withdrawal from or material modification to trade agreements, and/or if CBP detains shipments of our goods pursuant to a withhold release order could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. If additional tariffs or trade restrictions are implemented by the U.S. or other countries, the cost of our products could increase which could adversely affect our business.

If we cannot successfully negotiate rent deferrals or abatements, lease modifications or lease terminations, our substantial operating lease obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business and our landlords may attempt to hold us in breach of our lease obligations and take other actions, including terminating our leases and/or accelerating our future rent. 

We do not own any of our retail store facilities, but instead lease all of our stores under operating leases. Our leases generally have terms of up to 10 years, generally require a fixed annual base rent and some require the payment of additional percentage rent if store sales exceed a negotiated amount. Certain of our European stores also require initial investments in the form of key money to secure prime locations, which may be paid to landlords or existing lessees. Generally, our leases are “net” leases, which require us to pay all of the costs of insurance, taxes, maintenance and utilities. We generally cannot cancel these leases or withhold payments at our option, and payments under these operating leases account for a significant portion of our operating costs. For example, as of March 27, 2021, we were party to operating leases associated with our retail stores that we operate directly throughout the globe, as well as other global corporate facilities, requiring future minimum lease payments aggregating to $1.8 billion through Fiscal 2026 and approximately $493 million thereafter through Fiscal 2044.

In light of our retail store closures in response to government orders, mandates, guidelines and recommendations limiting business operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as decisions by many of the retail centers in which we operate to close shopping centers, we temporarily closed all of our retail stores in North America and Europe. On April 1, 2020, we suspended rent payments under the leases for these stores. In many instances, we were able to negotiate with counterparties under our leases to defer or abate the applicable rent during the store closure period, to modify the terms (including rent) of our leases going forward when stores reopen, or in certain instances to terminate the leases and permanently close retail stores. However, in instances where we were unable to negotiate with landlords, the landlords could allege that we are in default under 

22
the lease and attempt to terminate our lease and/or accelerate our future rents. Although we believe that strong legal grounds exist to support our claim that we are not obligated to pay rent during periods of closure as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance whether or not, and to what degree, such arguments will be successful, and any dispute under these leases may result in litigation with the landlord, which could be costly and have an uncertain outcome.

In addition, as certain of our retail stores in Europe, Canada and parts of Asia remain closed and as other locations reopen, we expect to require additional negotiations with our landlords to further defer or abate rent, to modify the terms of our leases (including rent and expiration date) and in certain instances to terminate a lease or permanently close a store. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate rent deferrals or abatements, lease modifications or lease terminations on favorable terms or at all. Our substantial operating lease obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are dependent on a limited number of distribution facilities. If one or more of our distribution facilities experience operational difficulties or becomes inoperable, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We operate a limited number of distribution facilities. Our ability to meet the needs of our own retail stores and e-commerce sites, as well as our wholesale customers, depends on the proper and uninterrupted operation of these distribution facilities. If any of these distribution facilities were to shut down or otherwise become inoperable or inaccessible for any reason (including as a result of a government mandate or order due to COVID-19), we could suffer a substantial loss of inventory and/or disruptions of deliveries to our retail and wholesale customers. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products during the time it takes to reopen or replace the damaged facility. Any of the foregoing factors could result in decreased sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In addition, we have been moving into new and larger facilities as needed to further support our efforts to operate with increased efficiency and flexibility. There are risks inherent in operating in new distribution environments and implementing new warehouse management systems, including technological and operational difficulties that may arise with such transitions. We may experience shipping delays should there be any disruptions in our new warehouse management systems or warehouses themselves.

The departure of members of our executive management and other key employees or our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We depend on the services and management experience of executive officers, who have substantial experience and expertise in our business. We also depend on other key employees involved in our design and marketing operations, including our creative officers for each of our brands, Ms. Donatella Versace, Ms. Sandra Choi and Mr. Michael Kors. Competition for qualified personnel in the fashion industry is intense, and competitors may use aggressive tactics to recruit our executive officers and key employees. Our ability to attract and retain employees is influenced by our ability to offer competitive compensation and benefits, employee morale, our reputation, recruitment by other employers, perceived internal opportunities, non-competition and non-solicitation agreements and macro unemployment rates. Although we have entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and other key employees, we may not be able to retain the services of such individuals in the future. The loss of services of one or more of these individuals or any negative public perception with respect to, or relating to, the loss of one or more of these individuals, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our operational efficiency initiatives as well as acquisitions and related integration activity may intensify this risk.

We must also attract, develop, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified retail and distribution center personnel. Historically, competition for talent has been intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain a sufficient number of qualified employees in future periods to execute on our business objectives. Additionally, our ability to meet our labor needs while also controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and overtime regulations. If we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain talented employees with the necessary skills and experience, or if changes to our organizational structure, operating results, or business model, including as a result of COVID-19, adversely affect morale, hiring and/or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

23
Fluctuations in our tax obligations and changes in tax laws, treaties and regulations may have a material adverse impact on our future effective tax rates and results of operations.

Our subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, with the applicable tax rates varying by jurisdiction. As a result, our overall effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of earnings from the various tax jurisdictions. We record tax expense based on our estimates of taxable income and required reserves for uncertain tax positions in multiple tax jurisdictions. At any time, there are multiple tax years that are subject to examinations by various taxing authorities. The ultimate resolution of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may result in a settlement amount that differs from our original estimate. Any proposed or future changes in tax laws, treaties and regulations or interpretations where we operate could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rates, results of operations and financial condition.

We and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions. Although we believe that these transactions reflect arm’s-length terms and that proper transfer pricing documentation is in place, the transfer prices and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities, which could result in additional tax liabilities. On October 5, 2015, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, an international association of thirty four countries, including the U.S. and U.K., released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties. Future tax reform resulting from this development may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate and/or result in higher cash tax liabilities.

Our business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Our results of operations for our international subsidiaries are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency into U.S. Dollars during financial statement consolidation. If the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions could impact our consolidated results of operations. In addition, we have intercompany notes amongst certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries, which may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency of a particular reporting entity. As a result of using a currency other than the functional currency of the related subsidiary, results of these operations may be adversely affected during times of significant fluctuation between the functional currency of that subsidiary and the denomination currency of the note. We continuously monitor our foreign currency exposure and hedge a portion of our foreign subsidiaries’ foreign currency-denominated inventory purchases to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we cannot fully anticipate all of our foreign currency exposures and cannot ensure that these hedges will fully offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also use fixed-to-fixed cross currency swap agreements to hedge our net investments in foreign operations against future volatility in the exchange rates between the U.S. Dollars and these foreign currencies. As a result, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. 

As a result of operating retail stores and concessions in various countries outside of the U.S., we are also exposed to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, the British Pound, the Chinese Renminbi, the Japanese Yen, the Korean Won and the Canadian Dollar, among others. A substantial weakening of foreign currencies against the U.S. Dollar could require us to raise our retail prices or reduce our profit margins in various locations outside of the U.S. In addition, our sales and profitability could be negatively impacted if consumers in those markets were unwilling to purchase our products at increased prices.

Our current and future licensing and joint venture arrangements may not be successful and may make us susceptible to the actions of third parties over whom we have limited control.

We have entered into a select number of product licensing agreements with companies that produce and sell, under our trademarks, products requiring specialized expertise. We have also entered into a number of select licensing agreements pursuant to which we have granted third parties certain rights to distribute and sell our products in certain geographical areas and have a number of joint ventures. In the future, we may enter into additional licensing and/or joint venture arrangements. Although we take steps to carefully select our partners, such arrangements may not be successful. Our partners may fail to fulfill their obligations under these agreements or have interests that differ from or conflict with our own, such as the timing of new store openings, the pricing of our products and the offering of competitive products. In addition, the risks applicable to the business of our partners may be different than the risks applicable to our business, including risks associated with each such partner’s ability to:

•obtain capital;

•exercise operational and financial control over its business;

24
•manage its labor relations;

•maintain relationships with suppliers;

•manage its credit and bankruptcy risks which may be exacerbated by the impact of COVID-19; and

•maintain customer relationships.

Any of the foregoing risks, or the inability of any of our partners to successfully market our products or otherwise conduct its business, may result in loss of revenue and competitive harm to our operations in regions or product categories where we have entered into such licensing arrangements.

We rely on our partners to preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through, among other things, approval rights over store location and design, product design, production quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our stores and products, we may not be able to control the use by our partners of our brand. The misuse of our brand by a licensing or joint venture partner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Increases in the cost of raw materials could increase our production costs and cause our operating results and financial condition to suffer.

Our business is subject to volatility of costs related to certain raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products. The costs of raw materials used in our products are affected by, among other things, weather, consumer demand, speculation on the commodities market, the relative valuations and fluctuations of the currencies of producer versus consumer countries and other factors that are generally unpredictable and beyond our control. We are not always successful in our efforts to protect our business from the volatility of the market price of raw materials and our business can be materially affected by dramatic movements in prices of raw materials. The ultimate effect of this change on our earnings cannot be quantified, as the effect of movements in raw materials prices on industry selling prices are uncertain, but any significant increase in these prices could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our costs may be impacted by sanction tariffs and customs trade orders which could also impact sourcing and availability of raw materials used by our suppliers in the manufacturing of certain of our products. Manufacturing labor costs are also subject to volatility based on local and global economic conditions. Increases in commodity prices, tariffs, sanctions, customs trade orders and/or manufacturing labor costs could increase our production costs and negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and financial condition.

We primarily use foreign manufacturing contractors and independent third-party agents to source our finished goods and our business is subject to risks inherent in global sourcing activities, including disruptions or delays in manufacturing or shipments.

Our products are primarily produced by, and purchased or procured from, independent manufacturing contractors located mainly in Asia and Europe. A manufacturing contractor’s failure to ship products to us in a timely manner or to meet the required quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers for those items. The failure to make timely deliveries may cause customers to cancel orders, refuse to accept deliveries or demand reduced prices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 

We do not have written agreements with any of our third-party manufacturing contractors. As a result, any single manufacturing contractor could unilaterally terminate its relationship with us at any time. For example, in Fiscal 2021, Michael Kors’ largest manufacturing contractor, who produces its products in Asia and who Michael Kors has worked with for over ten years, accounted for the production of 18% of our finished products, based on dollar volume. Our inability to promptly replace manufacturing contractors that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality products in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, and impact the cost and availability of our goods.

Michael Kors uses third-party agents to source finished goods with numerous manufacturing contractors on its behalf. Any single agent could unilaterally terminate its relationship with Michael Kors at any time. In Fiscal 2021, Michael Kors’ largest third-party agent, whose primary place of business is Hong Kong and who Michael Kors has worked with for over 10 years, sourced approximately 26% of its purchases of finished goods, based on unit volume. Our inability to promptly replace agents that terminate their relationships with us or cease to provide high quality service in a timely and cost-efficient manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

25
In addition, as a company engaged in sourcing on a global scale, we are subject to the risks inherent in such activities, including, but not limited to: 

•disease pandemics, epidemics and health-related concerns, including related to COVID-19 or variants thereof;

•political or labor instability, labor shortages (stemming from labor disputes or otherwise), or increases in costs of labor or production in countries where manufacturing contractors and suppliers are located;

•labor disputes or strikes at the location of the source of our goods and/or at ports of entry;

•disruptions or delays in shipments, including port delays and congestion, and/or capacity constraints on transportation of goods due to COVID-19;

•political or military conflict;

•heightened terrorism security concerns;

•a significant decrease in availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials;

•the migration and development of manufacturing contractors;

•product quality issues;

•imposition of regulations, quotas and safeguards relating to imports and our ability to adjust in a timely manner to changes in trade regulations;

•increases in the costs of fuel (including volatility in the price of oil), travel and transportation (including vessel and freight);

•imposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports;

•significant fluctuation of the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies; 

•restrictions on transfers of funds out of countries where our foreign licensees are located;

•compliance by our independent manufacturers and suppliers with our Supplier Code of Conduct and other applicable compliance policies; and

•compliance with U.S. laws regarding the identification and reporting on the use of “conflict minerals” sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the Company’s products and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and other global anti-corruption laws, as applicable.

If we fail to comply with labor laws or collective bargaining agreements, or if our independent manufacturing contractors fail to use acceptable, ethical business practices, our business and reputation could suffer.

We are subject to labor laws governing relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions and citizenship requirements. We are also subject to collective bargaining agreements with respect to employees in certain European countries. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as collective bargaining agreements, may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation.

We require our independent manufacturing contractors to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance, as well as our Supplier Code of Conduct and other compliance policies under our Factory Social Compliance Program. Our staff and third parties we retain for such purposes periodically visit and monitor the operations of our independent manufacturing contractors to determine compliance. However, we generally do not control these manufacturing contractors or suppliers or their labor, environmental or other business practices. The violation of labor, environmental or other laws by an independent manufacturer or supplier, or divergence of an independent manufacturer’s or supplier’s labor practices from those generally accepted as ethical or appropriate in the U.S. or that violate our Supplier Code of Conduct, could interrupt or otherwise disrupt the shipment of our products, harm our trademarks or damage our reputation. The occurrence of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We may be unable to protect our trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, and others may allege that we infringe upon their intellectual property rights.

Our VERSACE, JIMMY CHOO and MICHAEL KORS trademarks, as well as other material trademarks, copyrights and design and patent rights related to the production, marketing and distribution of our products, are important to our success and our competitive position. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing our intellectual property rights in the Americas, EMEA, Asia and elsewhere in the world in both online and offline channels. Our brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and the generally higher pricing of our products creates additional incentive for counterfeiters 

26
to infringe on our brands. We work with customs authorities, law enforcement, legal representatives and brand specialists globally in an effort to prevent the sale of counterfeit products, but we cannot guarantee the extent to which our efforts to prevent counterfeiting of our brands and other intellectual property infringement will be successful. Such counterfeiting and other intellectual property infringement could dilute our brands and otherwise harm our reputation and business.

Our trademark and other intellectual property applications may fail to result in registered trademarks or other intellectual property or to provide the scope of coverage sought, and others may seek to invalidate our trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property or block sales of our products as an alleged violation of their trademarks and/or intellectual property rights. In addition, others may assert rights in, or ownership of, trademarks, copyrights and/or other intellectual property rights of ours or in trademarks, copyrights or other intellectual property that are similar to ours or that we license, and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, other intellectual property owners may have prior rights to our trademarks or similar trademarks or intellectual property. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect trademarks, copyrights and/or other intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States or the European Union.

From time to time, in the ordinary course of our business, we become involved in opposition and cancellation proceedings with respect to trademarks or other intellectual property similar to some of our brands. Any litigation or dispute involving the scope or enforceability of our intellectual property rights or any allegation that we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others could be costly and time-consuming and, if determined adversely to us, could result in harm to our competitive position.

We self-insure certain risks and may be impacted by unfavorable claims experience. 

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance programs, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks including, employee health-care benefits, workers’ compensation, general liability, marine transport and inventory, property damage and business interruption. Claims are difficult to predict and may be volatile. Any adverse claims experience could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 

We are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims in the ordinary course of business which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are a global company and are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims throughout the world in the ordinary course of business. These claims could include commercial, intellectual property, employment, customer and data privacy claims, as well as class action lawsuits. Typically, these claims raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Plaintiffs may seek unspecified damages and/or injunctive or other equitable relief. Our potential liability may be covered in part by our insurance policies, but we may not always have adequate insurance to defend all claims. An unfavorable outcome in any proceeding, lawsuit, dispute or claim may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our business is susceptible to the risks associated with climate change and other environmental impacts which could negatively affect our business and operations.

Our retail stores, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, including those operated by third-parties, are subject to risks relating to climate change and other environmental impacts from our operations. For example, the physical effects of climate change, such as severe weather events, natural disasters and/or significant changes in climate patterns as well as our carbon emissions and our business’ overall impact on the environment could subject us to reputational, market and/or regulatory risks. Climate change and other environmental concerns may cause social and economic disruptions in the places where we operate, including disruptions to our supply chain and to local infrastructure and transportation systems which could limit material availability and quality, impact our ability to ship and deliver product and prevent access to our physical locations. These events could also adversely affect the economy and negatively impact consumer confidence and discretionary spending. Concern over climate change may result in new or additional legal, legislative and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. There is also increased focus, including by investors, customers, and other stakeholders, on climate change and other sustainability matters. In April 2020, we announced a global strategy to achieve significant, measurable goals across a range of important environmental and social sustainability issues, including, material sourcing, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and converting to renewal energy, responsible water use and waste reduction. We may not be successful in attaining our goals, and even if we meet our commitments, there remains a significant risk that climate change and other environmental events could negatively impact our operations.

27
Increased scrutiny from investors and others regarding our corporate social responsibility initiatives, including environmental, social and other matters of significance relating to sustainability, could result in additional costs or risks and adversely impact our reputation. 

Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, investment funds, other market participants, shareholders and customers have increasingly focused on the environmental, social and governance ("ESG") or “sustainability” practices of companies. These parties have placed increased importance on the implications of the social cost of their investments. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other industry stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation and customer and employee retention may be negatively impacted. Any sustainability report that we publish or other sustainability disclosure we make may include our policies and practices on a variety of social and ethical matters, including corporate governance, environmental compliance, employee health and safety practices, human capital management, product quality, supply chain management, and workforce inclusion and diversity. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG practices or the speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and require additional resources to monitor, report and comply with various ESG practices. Also, our failure, or perceived failure, to meet the standards included in any sustainability disclosure could negatively impact our reputation, employee retention and the willingness of our customers and suppliers to do business with us.

The accessories, footwear and apparel industries are heavily influenced by general macroeconomic cycles that affect consumer spending and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The accessories, footwear and apparel industries have historically been subject to cyclical variations, recessions in the general economy and uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that can affect consumer spending habits. Purchases of discretionary luxury items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower. The success of our operations depends on a number of factors impacting discretionary consumer spending, including the duration and severity of the pandemic and the success of vaccination efforts, new information concerning the virus or variants of the variance, and actions different states, regions or countries may take to contain the virus (including extended lock-downs and travel restrictions), among others, general economic conditions, consumer confidence, wages and unemployment, housing prices, consumer debt, interest rates, fuel and energy costs, taxation and political conditions. A worsening of the economy may negatively affect consumer and wholesale purchases of our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors which may cause our profitability and gross margins in the future to be materially lower than our expectations.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including the impact of COVID-19 on the economy and consumer discretionary spending, intense competition and a highly promotional environment, fragmentation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, changes in consumer behavior, fashion trends, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs and weather and other environmental conditions. These factors may cause our profitability and gross margins in the future to be materially lower than in recent periods and our expectations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may be faced with significant excess inventories (due to the impact of COVID-19 or otherwise), and in the future, if we misjudge the market for our products, we may have excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for other products. We may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of excess and slow-moving inventory, which also may negatively impact our gross margin and profitability.

Risks Related to Privacy and Data Security

Privacy breaches and other cyber security risks related to our business could negatively affect our reputation, credibility and business.

We are dependent on information technology (“IT”) systems and networks for a significant portion of our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce sites and retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing. We are responsible for storing data relating to our customers and employees and also rely on third party vendors for the storage, processing and transmission of personal and Company information. Consumers, lawmakers and consumer advocates alike are increasingly concerned over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, consumer identity theft and privacy and the retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. In addition to taking the necessary precautions ourselves, we generally require that third-party service providers implement reasonable security measures 

28
to protect our employees’ and customers’ identity and privacy. We do not, however, control these third-party service providers and cannot guarantee the elimination of electronic or physical computer break-ins or security breaches in the future. Cyber security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, security breaches due to employee error or misconduct, attacks by “hackers,” phishing scams, malicious software programs such as viruses and malware, and other breaches outside of our control, could result in unauthorized access or damage to our IT systems and the IT systems of our third party service providers. Despite our efforts and the efforts of our third-party service providers to secure our and their IT systems, attacks on these systems do occur from time to time. As the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to IT systems become more varied and sophisticated (including in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, as cybercriminals are finding new ways to launch their attacks) and if the occurrence of such security breaches becomes more frequent, we and our third-party service providers may be unable to adequately anticipate these techniques and implement appropriate preventative measures. While we maintain cyber risk insurance to provide some coverage for certain risks associated with cyber security incidents, there is no assurance that such insurance would cover all or a significant portion of the costs or consequences associated with a cyber security incident. A significant breach of customer, employee or Company data could damage our reputation, our relationship with customers and our brands, and could result in lost sales, sizable fines, significant breach-notification and other costs and lawsuits, as well as adversely affect our results of operations. We may also incur additional costs in the future related to the implementation of additional security measures to protect against new or enhanced data security and privacy threats, or to comply with current and new state, federal and international laws governing the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information which are continuously being enacted and proposed, such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the EU and the California Consumer Privacy Act in California in the United States, as well as increased cyber security protection costs such as organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees, engaging third party experts and consultants and lost revenues resulting from unauthorized use of proprietary information.

A material delay or disruption in our information technology systems or e-commerce websites or our failure or inability to upgrade our information technology systems precisely and efficiently could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We rely extensively on our IT systems to track inventory, manage our supply chain, record and process transactions, manage customer communications, summarize results and manage our business. The failure of our IT systems to operate properly or effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or difficulty in or failure to implement new systems, could adversely affect our business. We also operate a number of e-commerce websites throughout the world. Our IT systems and e-commerce websites may be subject to damage and/or interruption from power outages, computer, network and telecommunications failures, malicious software, such as viruses and malware, attacks by “hackers”, security breaches, usage errors or misconduct by our employees and bad acts by our customers and website visitors which could materially adversely affect our business.

In early Fiscal 2020, we embarked on a multi-year ERP implementation, but as a result of COVID-19 and our need to significantly reduce our capital expenditures in order to protect our liquidity and cash flows, we temporarily suspended our ERP project. Parts of the project have resumed as of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2021. Our inability to fully resume our ERP implementation and to upgrade our IT systems could result in system failures, disruptions, damage or malfunctions, cause critical information upon which we rely to be delayed, defective, corrupted, inadequate, inaccessible or lost and otherwise cause delays or disruptions to our operations. If any of these events happen, we may have to make significant investments to fix or replace impacted systems. Our failure or inability to upgrade IT systems effectively also could cause us to be unable to compete effectively, could harm our reputation and credibility, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Risks Related to Our Debt

We have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or engage in additional transactions.

As of March 27, 2021, our consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.3 billion, net of debt issuance costs. Our total borrowings as of March 27, 2021 primarily relate to senior notes of $450 million and term loans of $870 million. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. Until recently, we have been able to use our cash from operations to fund our debt service obligations and to utilize our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility to supplement our near-term liquidity needs. Our cash from operations have declined significantly, largely due to retail store closures and reduced store traffic caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our substantial level of indebtedness could have negative consequences to our business and we cannot guarantee that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from our operations or that future 

29
borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make payments of our debt, fund other liquidity needs, make necessary capital expenditures or pursue certain business opportunities. Our financial results, our substantial indebtedness and our credit ratings could adversely affect the availability and terms of our financing and negatively impact our ability to enter into new financing arrangements in the future.

The obligations under the second amendment, dated June 25, 2020 (the “Second Amendment”), to the third amended and restated credit facility, dated as of November 15, 2018 (the “2018 Credit Facility”) are secured by liens on substantially all of the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries that are borrowers and guarantors, subject to certain exceptions, and substantially all of the registered intellectual property of the Company and its subsidiaries. This requirement for collateral will be removed if the Company achieves an investment grade ratings requirement for two consecutive full fiscal quarters but there can be no assurance that the ratings requirement will be satisfied. In addition, our ability to access the credit and capital markets in the future as a source of funding, and the borrowing costs associated with such financing, is dependent upon market conditions and our credit rating and outlook. In March 2020, Moody’s Investor Service downgraded their credit rating of us from Baa2 to Ba1, and in April 2020 Fitch Ratings downgraded their credit rating of us from BBB- to BB+. These downgrades, and any future reduction in our credit ratings, could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financial documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs.

We may be unable to meet financial covenants in our indebtedness agreements which could result in an event of default and restrictive covenants in such agreements may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.

Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the financial covenant in the Company’s 2018 Credit Facility requiring it to maintain a ratio of the sum of total indebtedness plus the capitalized amount of all operating lease obligations for the last four fiscal quarters to Consolidated EBITDAR of no greater than 3.75 to 1.0 has been waived through the fiscal quarter ending June 26, 2021. The Company terminated the waiver period effective May 26, 2021. Effective as of that date, the applicable ratio will be calculated net of the Company’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million and shall exclude up to $150 million of supply chain financings, and the maximum permitted net leverage ratio will be 4.00 to 1.0. The Second Amendment also requires the Company, during the period from June 25, 2020 until it delivers its financial statements with respect to the fiscal quarter ending June 26, 2021, to maintain at all times unrestricted cash and cash equivalents plus the aggregate undrawn amounts under the revolving facilities under the 2018 Credit Facility of not less than $500 million.

In addition, the 2018 Credit Facility and the Indenture governing our senior notes contain certain restrictive covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us, and the Second Amendment imposes incremental restrictions on certain of these covenants during the covenant relief period provided under the 2018 Credit Facility, including restrictions on our ability to:

•incur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;

•pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock;

•make loans and investments, including acquisitions;

•sell assets;

•incur liens;

•enter into transactions with affiliates; and

•consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets

which collectively may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest.

A breach of the covenants or restrictions under the documents that govern our indebtedness could result in an event of default under the applicable indebtedness. Such a default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies. In addition, an event of default under the credit agreement governing our 2018 Credit Facility would permit the lenders under our 2018 Credit Facility to terminate all commitments to extend further credit under that facility and foreclose on the collateral that secures the 2018 Credit Facility. In the event our lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of our borrowings, we and our subsidiaries may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. As a result of these restrictions, we may be:

•limited in how we conduct our business;

•unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, including as a result of COVID-19; or

•unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.

Risks Related to Our Ordinary Shares

Our share price may periodically fluctuate based on the accuracy of our earnings guidance or other forward-looking statements regarding our financial performance.

Our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term growth and profitability and not to achieve an earnings target in any particular fiscal quarter. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of our Company and our shareholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of total revenue, earnings per share, comparable store sales and other financial metrics or projections. While we generally expect to provide updates to our financial guidance when we report our results each fiscal quarter, we do not have any responsibility to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. However, such long-range targets are more difficult to predict than our current quarter and fiscal year expectations. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our share price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these predictions when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our share price.

We periodically return value to shareholders through our share repurchase program. Investors may have an expectation that we will repurchase all shares available under our share repurchase program. As a result of COVID-19, we suspended our share repurchase program. The market price of our securities could be adversely affected if our share repurchase activity differs from investors’ expectations or if our share repurchase program were to terminate.

Failure to maintain adequate financial and management processes and controls could lead to errors in our financial reporting, which could harm our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.

As a public company, we are required to document and test our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. If our management is unable to certify the effectiveness of our internal controls or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence, which could have an adverse effect on our business and cause a decline in the price of our ordinary shares.

Provisions in our organizational documents may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party.

Our Memorandum and Articles of Association (together, as amended from time to time, our “Memorandum and Articles”) contain several provisions that may make it more difficult or expensive for a third party to acquire control of us without the approval of our board of directors. These provisions may delay, prevent or deter a merger, acquisition, tender offer, proxy contest or other transaction that might otherwise result in our shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their ordinary shares. These provisions include, among others:

•our board of directors’ ability to amend the Memorandum and Articles to create and issue, from time to time, one or more classes of preference shares and, with respect to each such class, to fix the terms thereof by resolution;

•provisions relating to the multiple classes and three-year terms of directors, the manner of election of directors, removal of directors and the appointment of directors upon an increase in the number of directors or vacancy on our board of directors;

•restrictions on the ability of shareholders to call meetings and bring proposals before meetings;

•elimination of the ability of shareholders to act by written consent; and

•the requirement of the affirmative vote of 75% of the shares entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our Memorandum and Articles.

These provisions of our Memorandum and Articles could discourage potential takeover attempts and reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for our ordinary shares in the future, which could reduce the market price of our ordinary shares.

31
Rights of shareholders under British Virgin Islands law differ from those under United States law, and, accordingly, our shareholders may have fewer protections.

Our corporate affairs are governed by our Memorandum and Articles, the BVI Business Companies Act, 2004 (as amended, the “BVI Act”) and the common law of the British Virgin Islands. The rights of shareholders to take legal action against our directors, actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of the British Virgin Islands and by the BVI Act. The common law of the British Virgin Islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the British Virgin Islands as well as from English common law, which has persuasive, but not binding, authority on a court in the British Virgin Islands. The rights of our shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors under British Virgin Islands law are not as clearly established as they would be under statutes or judicial precedents in some jurisdictions in the United States. In particular, the British Virgin Islands has a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the United States, and some states (such as Delaware) have more fully developed and judicially interpreted bodies of corporate law. As a result of the foregoing, holders of our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests through actions against our management, directors or major shareholders than they would as shareholders of a U.S. company.

The laws of the British Virgin Islands provide limited protection for minority shareholders, so minority shareholders will have limited or no recourse if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our affairs.

Under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, there is limited statutory law for the protection of minority shareholders other than the provisions of the BVI Act dealing with shareholder remedies. The principal protection under statutory law is that shareholders may bring an action to enforce the constituent documents of a British Virgin Islands company and are entitled to have the affairs of the Company conducted in accordance with the BVI Act and the memorandum and articles of association of the Company. As such, if those who control the Company have persistently disregarded the requirements of the BVI Act or the provisions of the Company’s memorandum and articles of association, then the courts will likely grant relief. Generally, the areas in which the courts will intervene are the following: (i) an act complained of which is outside the scope of the authorized business or is illegal or not capable of ratification by the majority; (ii) acts that constitute fraud on the minority where the wrongdoers control the Company; (iii) acts that infringe on the personal rights of the shareholders, such as the right to vote; and (iv) acts where the Company has not complied with provisions requiring approval of a special or extraordinary majority of shareholders, which are more limited than the rights afforded to minority shareholders under the laws of many states in the United States.

It may be difficult to enforce judgments against us or our executive officers and directors in jurisdictions outside the United States.

Under our Memorandum and Articles, we may indemnify and hold our directors harmless against all claims and suits brought against them, subject to limited exceptions. Furthermore, to the extent allowed by law, the rights and obligations among or between us, any of our current or former directors, officers and employees and any current or former shareholder will be governed exclusively by the laws of the British Virgin Islands and subject to the jurisdiction of the British Virgin Islands courts, unless those rights or obligations do not relate to or arise out of their capacities as such. Although there is doubt as to whether United States' courts would enforce these provisions in an action brought in the United States under United States securities laws, these provisions could make judgments obtained outside of the British Virgin Islands more difficult to enforce against our assets in the British Virgin Islands or jurisdictions that would apply British Virgin Islands law.

British Virgin Islands companies may not be able to initiate shareholder derivative actions, thereby depriving shareholders of one avenue to protect their interests.

British Virgin Islands companies may not have standing to initiate a shareholder derivative action in a federal court of the United States. The circumstances in which any such action may be brought, and the procedures and defenses that may be available in respect of any such action, may result in the rights of shareholders of a British Virgin Islands' company being more limited than those of shareholders of a company organized in the United States. Accordingly, shareholders may have fewer alternatives available to them if they believe that corporate wrongdoing has occurred. The British Virgin Islands courts are also unlikely to recognize or enforce judgments of courts in the United States based on certain liability provisions of United States securities law or to impose liabilities, in original actions brought in the British Virgin Islands, based on certain liability provisions of the United States securities laws that are penal in nature. There is no statutory recognition in the British Virgin Islands of judgments obtained in the United States, although the courts of the British Virgin Islands will generally recognize and enforce the non-penal judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction without retrial on the merits. This means that even if shareholders were to sue us successfully, they may not be able to recover anything to make up for the losses suffered.
