OVERVIEW

Background

Southwestern Energy Company (including its subsidiaries, collectively, “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” or “Southwestern”) is an independent energy company engaged in natural gas, oil and NGLs exploration, development and production, which we refer to as “E&P.” We are also focused on creating and capturing additional value through our marketing business, which we call “Marketing”. We conduct most of our businesses through subsidiaries, and we currently operate exclusively in the lower 48 United States. 

E&P. Our primary business is the exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs, with our ongoing operations focused on the development of unconventional natural gas reservoirs located in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Our operations in northeast Pennsylvania, which we refer to as “Northeast Appalachia,” are primarily focused on the unconventional natural gas reservoir known as the Marcellus Shale. Our operations in West Virginia, Ohio and southwest Pennsylvania, which we refer to as “Southwest Appalachia,” are focused on the Marcellus Shale, the Utica and the Upper Devonian unconventional natural gas and oil reservoirs. Collectively, our properties in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia are herein referred to as “Appalachia.” We also have drilling rigs located in Appalachia, and we provide certain oilfield products and services, principally serving our E&P operations though vertical integration.

On November 13, 2020, we closed on our Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger agreement”) with Montage Resources Corporation (“Montage”) pursuant to which Montage merged with and into Southwestern, with Southwestern continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). The Merger expanded our footprint in Appalachia by supplementing our Northeast Appalachia and Southwest Appalachia operations and by expanding our operations into Ohio. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information on the Merger. 

Marketing. Our marketing activities capture opportunities that arise through the marketing and transportation of natural gas, oil, and NGLs primarily produced in our E&P operations. 

Focus in 2020.  We entered 2020 with a continued focus on optimizing our cost structure, maximizing margins in each of our core areas of business while further developing our knowledge of our asset base and looking for strategic transactions that take advantage of our core strengths. The recent Merger and the associated expected cost and operational synergies is a reflection of this strategy. While COVID-19 brought challenges of lower demand for certain of our products resulting in lower oil and NGL pricing (discussed below), we exercised our capital and operational agility by quickly shifting our investments to our higher return natural gas assets. We remained committed to our focus on creating sustainable value with the goal of generating cash flow above and beyond our operational needs, while at the same time maintaining our leading position as stewards of the environment. We continued to protect our financial strength through bond repurchases at a discount as well as a robust derivative program designed to ensure certain cash flow levels by reducing our exposure to commodity price volatility.

Lower natural gas, oil and NGL prices present challenges to our industry and our Company, as do changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment and other key factors described under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Annual Report. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental and societal measures (discussed below), along with the disagreements between OPEC and Russia on production levels, caused oil prices to decrease significantly in the first and second quarters of 2020. While oil pricing partially recovered late in the second quarter and continued to improve toward the end of the year, gains on our settled derivatives offset a large portion of the impact of the overall decline in prices. Although we currently expect to maintain a robust rolling three-year derivative portfolio, there can be no

assurance that we will be able to add derivative positions to cover our expected production at favorable prices. See “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” in Item 7A and Note 6 - Derivatives and Risk Management, in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details.

Market Conditions and Commodity Prices

During 2020, we did not experience any material impact to our ability to operate or market our production due to the direct or indirect impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In early March 2020, we instituted additional health measures at our facilities and banned nonessential travel. In mid-March, in advance of state and local governments restricting business operations and imposing “stay-at-home” directives in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Texas (where our operations and offices are located), we notified employees that those whose work does not require a physical presence should work from home. In late September 2020, based on the totality of the relevant data in each community, we reinstituted a phased return program of office-based employees, and we have instituted additional measures designed to prevent the possible spread of the virus, including social distancing and appropriate personal protective equipment. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security classifies individuals engaged in and supporting exploration for and production of natural gas, oil and NGLs as “essential critical infrastructure workforce,” and to date, state and local governments have followed this guidance and exempted these activities from business closures. Should this situation change, our access to supplies or workers to drill, complete and operate wells could be materially and adversely affected. 

Beginning late in the first quarter and extending through most of 2020, decreased transportation, manufacturing and general economic activity levels prompted by governmental and societal actions to COVID-19 reduced the demand for refined products such as gasoline, distillate and jet fuel and other refined products, as well as NGLs. Reduced demand, along with geopolitical events such as the disagreements between OPEC and Russia on production levels, caused a significant decline in oil and NGL pricing late in the first quarter of 2020. Although WTI prices for oil were 31% lower in 2020, as compared to 2019, our average realized price received for oil, including the impact of our derivatives, was only 5% lower in 2020, compared to the previous year. We recognized an additional $0.36 per Mcf on our gas production through our derivative program for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $0.16 per Mcf over the prior year, which partially offset a $0.55 decrease in the NYMEX price over the same period.

Late in the second quarter of 2020 and extending into the fourth quarter of 2020, certain states and local governments began the process of loosening restrictions, allowing businesses to reopen and lifting stay-at-home orders. In addition, OPEC and other countries instituted oil production curtailments. During this same period, oil and NGL prices have improved from historic lows in April due to lower industry-wide production levels and increased export demand, respectively. Further, although the reduced production of natural gas associated with oil wells dampened the effect of lower natural gas demand early in the second quarter, high natural gas storage inventories and lower LNG demand for U.S. cargoes led to a natural gas price decline late in the second quarter. During the third quarter of 2020, as more clarity emerged regarding the projected path for European natural gas storage, global LNG prices rallied substantially and signaled a resumption of U.S. LNG exports beginning in late September 2020. In addition, the recovery of U.S. natural gas production was less robust than most market estimates, which kept storage balances below capacity through the end of the injection season in October 2020. As a result of these events, the demand and related pricing for natural gas have improved from earlier in the year, and we continue to mitigate pricing risk for all of our commodities through our proactive derivative program.

The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis adversely impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the effectiveness of the vaccines and the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, its impact on the economy and market conditions, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. We will continually monitor our 2021 capital investment program to take into account these changed conditions and proactively adjust our activities and plans. Therefore, while this continued matter could potentially disrupt our operations, the degree of the potentially adverse financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Recent Financial and Operating Results

Significant operating and financial highlights for 2020 include:

Total Company

•Completion of the Merger with Montage on November 13, 2020, acquiring approximately 1,375 producing wells and approximately 320,000 net acres.

•Completion of a public offering of 63,250,000 shares of common stock at $2.50 per share with net proceeds of approximately $152 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

•Closed an offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8.375% senior notes due 2028 with net proceeds of $345 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

•Net loss of $3,112 million, or ($5.42) per diluted share, was down from a net income of $891 million, or $1.65 per diluted share, in 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to $2,825 million of non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments, an $818 million change in deferred tax provision and lower margins associated with reduced commodity prices.

•Operating loss was $2,871 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to an operating income of $270 million in 2019, primarily due to a $2,825 million non-cash full cost ceiling test impairment in 2020. Excluding the non-cash impairment, operating loss of $46 million decreased $316 million as increased natural gas and liquids production, lower depreciation, depletion and amortization and general and administrative expense were more than offset by reduced commodity prices along with merger-related expenses.

•Net cash provided by operating activities of $528 million decreased 45% from $964 million in 2019 as an improvement in settled derivatives and the impact of higher production was more than offset by lower commodity prices and an increase in operating expenses associated with higher liquids production, along with decreases in capitalized interest expense and working capital.

•Total capital invested of $899 million decreased 21% from $1,140 million in 2019.

E&P

•E&P segment operating loss was $2,864 million in 2020, compared to an operating income of $283 million in 2019. The decrease in 2020 was primarily due to non-cash full cost ceiling impairments of $2,825 million in 2020 and reduced commodity prices.

•Year-end reserves of 11,990 Bcfe decreased 731 Bcfe, or 6%, from 12,721 Bcfe at the end of 2019, as 2,354 Bcfe of acquired reserves, 1,424 Bcfe of positive performance revisions and 741 Bcfe of additions were more than offset by 4,370 Bcfe of downward price revisions and 880 Bcfe of production.

•Total net production of 880 Bcfe, which was comprised of 79% natural gas, 17% NGLs and 4% oil, increased 13% from 778 in 2019, and our liquids production increased 10% over the same period.

•Excluding the effect of derivatives, our realized natural gas price of $1.34 per Mcf, realized oil price of $29.20 per barrel and realized NGL price of $10.24 per barrel decreased 32%, 38% and 12%, respectively, from 2019. Our weighted average realized price excluding the effect of derivatives of $1.53 per Mcfe decreased 30% from the same period in 2019.

•The E&P segment invested $899 million in capital; drilling 98 wells, completing 96 wells and placing 100 wells to sales.

Outlook

In 2021, we expect to continue to exercise capital discipline in our investment program by investing below cash flow from operations, net of changes in working capital, in a focused effort to generate free cash flow. In addition, we expect to continue maintaining our robust hedging program, looking for ways to optimize our cost structure and maximizing margins in each core area of our business while further developing our knowledge of our asset base. By carrying out these objectives, we expect to generate additional free cash flow, which we intend to use to further strengthen our balance sheet. We remain committed to our focus on optimizing our portfolio by concentrating our efforts on our highest return investment opportunities. We believe that we and our industry will continue to face challenges due to the uncertainty of natural gas, oil and NGL prices in the United States, changes in laws, regulations and investor sentiment, and other key factors described above under “Risk Factors.”

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion of our results of operations for our segments is presented before intersegment eliminations. We evaluate our segments as if they were stand-alone operations and accordingly discuss their results prior to any intersegment eliminations. Interest expense, gain (loss) on derivatives, gain (loss) on early extinguishment of debt and income taxes are discussed on a consolidated basis.

We have applied the Securities and Exchange Commission’s recently adopted FAST Act Modernization and Simplification of Regulation S-K, which limits the discussion to the two most recent fiscal years. This discussion and analysis deals with comparisons of material changes in the consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019. For the comparison of fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 27, 2020.

E&P

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes $5 million related to gas balancing for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(2)Includes $2 million in third-party water sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(3)Includes $2,825 million of non-cash full-cost ceiling test impairments, $41 million in Montage merger-related expenses, $16 million of restructuring charges and $5 million of non-cash, non-full cost pool impairments for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(4)Includes $11 million of restructuring charges and $13 million of non-cash, non-full cost pool asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2019.

(5)Includes $11 million and $1 million amortization of premiums paid related to certain natural gas settled derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Operating Income

•E&P segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $2,864 million compared to an operating income of $283 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding $2,825 million of non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments recorded in 2020, our E&P segment operating loss was $39 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This decrease is primarily due to lower margins associated with decreased commodity pricing.

Revenues

The following illustrate the effects on sales revenues associated with changes in commodity prices and production volumes:

Production Volumes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Approximately 878 Bcfe and 776 Bcfe for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were produced from the Marcellus Shale formation.

•Production volumes for our E&P segment increased 102 Bcfe for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a 28% increase in production volumes in Southwest Appalachia.

•Oil and NGL production increased 9% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019.

Commodity Prices

The price we expect to receive for our production is a critical factor in determining the capital investments we make to develop our properties. Commodity prices fluctuate due to a variety of factors we can neither control nor predict, including increased supplies of natural gas, oil or NGLs due to greater exploration and development activities, weather conditions, political and economic events such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and competition from other energy sources. These factors impact supply and demand, which in turn determine the sales prices for our production. In addition to these factors, the prices we realize for our production are affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices, including basis differentials. We will continue to evaluate the commodity price environments and adjust the pace of our activity in order to maintain appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Based on last day settlement prices from monthly futures contracts.

(2)This discount includes a basis differential, a heating content adjustment, physical basis sales, third-party transportation charges and fuel charges, and excludes financial basis hedges.

We receive a sales price for our natural gas at a discount to average monthly NYMEX settlement prices based on heating content of the gas, locational basis differentials and transportation and fuel charges. Additionally, we receive a sales price for our oil and NGLs at a difference to average monthly West Texas Intermediate settlement and Mont Belvieu NGL composite prices, respectively, due to a number of factors including product quality, composition and types of NGLs sold, locational basis differentials and transportation and fuel charges.

We regularly enter into various derivatives and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas, oil and NGL production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations, including fluctuations in locational market differentials. We refer you to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Annual Report, Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, and our derivative risk factor for additional discussion about our derivatives and risk management activities.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)Includes post-production costs such as gathering, processing, fractionation and compression.

(2)Excludes $41 million in Montage merger-related expenses $16 million in restructuring charges and $1 million in legal settlement charges for the year ended December 31, 2020.

(3)Excludes $11 million in restructuring charges, a $6 million residual value guarantee short-fall payment to the previous lessor of our headquarters building and $6 million of legal settlement charges for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Lease Operating Expenses

•Lease operating expenses per Mcfe increased $0.01 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, as an increase in liquids production, which includes processing fees, was only partially offset by a decrease related to temporarily reduced gathering and transportation rates in Southwest Appalachia that became effective late in the second quarter of 2020.

General and Administrative Expenses

•General and administrative expenses in 2020 included $1 million in legal settlement charges. 2019 included a $6 million residual value guarantee short-fall payment to the previous lessor of our headquarters building and $6 million in legal settlement charges. Excluding these amounts, general and administrative expenses decreased $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to decreased personnel costs and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives.

•On a per Mcfe basis, excluding restructuring, Montage merger-related expenses, legal settlement charges and the residual value guarantee short-fall payment, general and administrative expenses per Mcfe decreased by $0.06 for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due to a 28% decrease in expenses and a 13% increase in production volumes.

Montage Merger-Related Expenses

•Montage merger-related expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 included $18 million in bank, legal and consulting fees; $17 million in employee severance and related costs; and $5 million related to the settlement of contracts inherited from Montage that had no future value to our ongoing business. We refer you to Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about the Merger. 

Restructuring Charges

•In February 2020, employees were notified of a workforce reduction plan as a result of a strategic realignment of our organizational structure. Affected employees were offered a severance package, which included a one-time cash payment depending on length of service and, if applicable, the current value of unvested long-term incentive awards that were forfeited. We also recognized additional severance costs in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to continued organizational restructuring. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a total restructuring expense of $16 million primarily related to cash severance, including payroll taxes.

•As of December 31, 2020, a $3 million liability for restructuring charges to be paid in 2021 has been recorded.

See Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our restructuring charges.

Taxes, Other than Income Taxes

•Taxes other than income taxes per Mcfe may vary from period to period due to changes in ad valorem and severance taxes that result from the mix of our production volumes and fluctuations in commodity prices. Taxes, other than income taxes, per Mcfe decreased $0.02 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to lower commodity pricing and lower effective tax rates in Southwest Appalachia.

Full Cost Pool Amortization

•Our full cost pool amortization rate decreased $0.18 per Mcfe for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019. The average amortization rate decreased primarily as a result of the impact of $2,825 million in non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments recorded in 2020.

•No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 in relation to our recently acquired Montage natural gas and oil properties. These properties were recorded at fair value as of November 13, 2020, in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. Pursuant to SEC guidance, we determined that the fair value of the properties acquired at the closing of the Merger clearly exceeded the related full-cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the properties acquired in the Merger from the ceiling test calculation. This waiver was granted for all reporting periods through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2021 as long as we can continue to demonstrate that the fair value of properties acquired clearly exceeds the full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt in each reporting period. As part of the waiver received from the SEC, we are required to disclose what the full cost ceiling test impairment amounts for all periods presented in each applicable quarterly and annual filing would have been if the waiver had not been granted. The fair value of the properties acquired in the Merger was based on forward strip natural gas and oil pricing existing at the date of the Merger, and we affirmed that there has not been a material decline to the fair value of these acquired assets since the Merger. The properties acquired in the Merger have an unamortized cost at December 31, 2020 of $1,087 million. Had we not received the waiver from the SEC, the impairment charge recorded would have been an additional $539 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

•The amortization rate is impacted by the timing and amount of reserve additions and the future development costs associated with those additions, revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance, write-downs that result from non-cash full cost ceiling impairments, proceeds from the sale of properties that reduce the full cost pool, and the levels of costs subject to amortization. We cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above, as well as other factors, including but not limited to the uncertainty of the amount of future reserve changes.

•Unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were $1,472 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $1,506 million at December 31, 2019. The unevaluated costs excluded from amortization decreased, as compared to 2019, as the evaluation of previously unevaluated properties totaling $262 million in 2020 was only partially offset by the impact of $228 million of unevaluated capital invested, which included $90 million for Montage properties acquired during the same period.

See “Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures” in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our unevaluated costs excluded from amortization.

Impairments

•We recognized $2,825 million in non-cash full cost ceiling test impairments for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to decreased commodity pricing over the prior 12 months. Additionally, we recognized a $5 million impairment to non-core assets.

•During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized non-cash impairments of $13 million associated with non-core E&P assets.

Marketing

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Operating Loss

•Marketing operating loss decreased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, as 2019 included a $3 million impairment of non-core gathering assets, a $2 million loss on the sale of operating assets and $1 million in gas storage gains recorded in other operating revenues. Additionally, marketing operating loss for 2020 included a $2 million decrease in operating costs and expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the marketing margin remained flat, compared to the prior year.

•The margin generated from marketing activities was $16 million for both years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Marketing margins are driven primarily by volumes marketed and may fluctuate depending on the prices paid for commodities, related cost of transportation and the ultimate disposition of those commodities. Increases and decreases in revenues due to changes in commodity prices and volumes marketed are largely offset by corresponding changes in purchase expenses. Efforts to optimize the cost of our transportation can result in greater expenses and therefore lower marketing margins.

Revenues

•Revenues from our marketing activities decreased $704 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, as a 27% decrease in the price received for volumes marketed more than offset a 37 Bcfe increase in the volumes marketed.

Operating Costs and Expenses

•Marketing operating costs and expenses decreased $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreased general and administrative expenses associated with decreased personnel costs and the implementation of cost reduction initiatives.

Consolidated

Interest Expense

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Interest expense related to our senior notes remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to 2019, as the interest savings from the repurchase of $107 million and $114 million of our outstanding senior notes in the first half of 2020 and the second half of 2019, respectively, was offset by the interest associated with the August 2020 public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.375% Senior Notes due 2028.

•Capitalized interest decreased $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 2019, due to the evaluation of natural gas and oil properties over the past twelve months. 

•Capitalized interest decreased as a percentage of gross interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to a larger percentage decrease in our unevaluated natural gas and oil properties balance as compared to the smaller percentage decrease in our gross interest expense over the same period. 

Gain (Loss) on Derivatives

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

We refer you to Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details about our gain (loss) on derivatives.

Gain (Loss) on Early Extinguishment of Debt

•In 2020, we recorded a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $35 million as a result of our repurchase of $107 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes for $72 million.

•In 2019, we recorded a gain of $8 million on early extinguishment of debt as a result of our repurchase of $62 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements of this Annual Report for more information on our long-term debt.

Income Taxes

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•As of the first quarter of 2019, we had sustained a three-year cumulative level of profitability. Based on this factor and other positive evidence including forecasted income, we concluded that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized and released substantially all of the valuation allowance. This resulted in a discrete tax benefit of $411 million being recorded for the year ended December 31, 2019. However, due to commodity price declines during 2020 and the write-down of the current value of our natural gas and oil properties, in addition to other negative evidence, we concluded that it was more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized and recorded a discrete tax expense of $408 million for the increase in our valuation allowance in the first quarter of 2020. The net change in valuation allowance is reflected as a component of income tax expense. We also continue to retain a valuation allowance of $87 million related to net operating losses in jurisdictions in which we no longer operate.

We refer you to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion about our income taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We depend primarily on funds generated from our operations, our 2018 credit facility, our cash and cash equivalents balance and capital markets as our primary sources of liquidity. In October 2020, the banks participating in our 2018 credit facility reaffirmed our elected borrowing base and aggregate commitments to be $1.8 billion. Upon the closing of the Merger in November 2020 and satisfaction of related conditions, the elected borrowing base and total aggregate commitments increased from $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion, the maximum permitted lien amount based on provisions in certain of our senior notes indentures. As of February 25, 2021, we had approximately $1.3 billion of total available liquidity, which exceeds our currently modeled needs, and looking forward in 2021, we remain committed to our strategy of free cash flow generation through capital discipline. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and the section below under “Credit Arrangements and Financing Activities” for additional discussion of our 2018 credit facility and related covenant requirements.

Our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon our ability to sell and the sales prices that we receive for our natural gas and liquids production. Natural gas, oil and NGL prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are driven by market supply and demand, which is impacted by many factors. See "Market Conditions and Commodity Prices" in the Overview section of Item 7 in Part II for additional discussion about current and potential future market conditions. The sales price we receive for our production is also influenced by our commodity derivative program. Our derivative contracts allow us to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations. In 2020, $362 million in realized gains on derivatives have offset a large portion of the impact of lower commodity prices, and although we are continually adding additional derivative positions for portions of our expected 2021, 2022 and 2023 production, there can be no assurance that we will be able to add derivative positions to cover the remainder of our expected production at favorable prices. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A and Note 6 in the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further details.

Our commodity hedging activities are subject to the credit risk of our counterparties being financially unable to settle the transaction. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties, performing both quantitative and qualitative assessments based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. However, any future failures by one or more counterparties could negatively impact our cash flow from operating activities.

Our short-term cash flows are also dependent on the timely collection of receivables from our customers and joint interest owners. We actively manage this risk through credit management activities and, through the date of this filing, have not experienced any significant write-offs for non-collectable amounts. However, any sustained inaccessibility of credit by our customers and joint interest owners could adversely impact our cash flows.

Due to these factors, we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations. Accordingly, we expect to adjust our discretionary uses of cash depending upon available cash flow. Further, we may from time to time seek to retire, rearrange or amend some or all of our outstanding debt or debt agreements through cash purchases, and/or exchanges, open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, tender offers or otherwise. Such transactions, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.

Credit Arrangements and Financing Activities

In April 2018, we replaced our credit facility entered into in 2016 with a new revolving credit facility (the "2018 credit facility") with a group of banks that, as amended, has a maturity date of April 2024. The 2018 credit facility has an aggregate maximum revolving credit amount of $3.5 billion and, in October 2020, the banks participating in our 2018 credit facility reaffirmed the borrowing base to be $1.8 billion, which also reflected our aggregate commitments. Upon the closing of the Merger in November 2020, the borrowing base and total aggregate commitments were increased from $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion. The borrowing base is subject to redetermination at least twice a year, in April and October, and is subject to change based primarily on drilling results, commodity prices, our future derivative position, the level of capital investment and operating costs. On October 8, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement governing the 2018 credit facility to, among other matters, limit our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to $200 million when loans under the 2018 credit facility are outstanding, subject to certain exceptions, and to increase the applicable rate by 25 basis points on loans outstanding under the 2018 credit facility. The 2018 credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including most of our subsidiaries. The permitted lien provisions in certain senior note indentures currently limit liens securing indebtedness to the greater of $2.0 billion or 25% of

adjusted consolidated net tangible assets. We may utilize the 2018 credit facility in the form of loans and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2020, we had $700 million borrowings on our revolving credit facility and $233 million in outstanding letters of credit. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our revolving credit facility.

As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility. Our ability to comply with financial covenants in future periods depends, among other things, on the success of our development program and upon other factors beyond our control, such as the market demand and prices for natural gas and liquids. We refer you to Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of the covenant requirements of our 2018 revolving credit facility.

The credit status of the financial institutions participating in our revolving credit facility could adversely impact our ability to borrow funds under the revolving credit facility. Although we believe all of the lenders under the facility have the ability to provide funds, we cannot predict whether each will be able to meet their obligation to us. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our revolving credit facility.

Our exposure to the anticipated transition from LIBOR in late 2021 is limited to the 2018 credit facility. Upon announcement by the administrator of LIBOR identifying a specific date for LIBOR cessation, the credit agreement governing the 2018 credit facility will be amended to reference an alternative rate as established by JP Morgan, as Administrative Agent, and Southwestern. The alternative rate will be based on the prevailing market convention and is expected to be the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (or “SOFR”).

In contemplation of the Merger with Montage, in August 2020, we completed a public offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes, with net proceeds from the offering totaling approximately $345 million after underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

In August 2020, we completed a public offering of 63,250,000 shares of our common stock with an offering price to the public of $2.50 per share. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses, were approximately $152 million. The proceeds from the common stock offering, in conjunction with the issuance of the 2028 Notes and additional borrowings on our revolving credit facility were used to fund a redemption of $510 million aggregate principal amount of Montage Notes in connection with the closing of the Merger. 

In 2020, we repurchased $6 million of our 4.10% Senior Notes due 2022, $36 million of our 4.95% Senior Notes due 2025, $21 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2026 and $44 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2027 for $72 million, and recognized a $35 million gain on the extinguishment of debt.

In the second half of 2019, we repurchased $35 million of our 4.95% Senior Notes due 2025, $11 million of our 7.50% Senior Notes due 2026 and $16 million of our 7.75% Senior Notes due 2027, and recognized an $8 million gain on extinguishment of debt. Additionally, in December 2019, we retired the remaining $52 million principal of our 4.05% Senior Notes due 2020. We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our senior notes. 

Because of the focused work on refinancing and repayment of our debt during the last three years, only $207 million, or 7%, of our outstanding debt balance as of December 31, 2020 is scheduled to become due prior to 2024. 

At February 25, 2021, we had a long-term issuer credit rating of Ba2 by Moody’s (rating and stable outlook affirmed on April 2, 2020), a long-term debt rating of BB- by S&P (rating affirmed and outlook upgraded to stable on October 15, 2020) and a long-term issuer default rating of BB by Fitch Ratings (rating affirmed and outlook upgraded to stable on January 29, 2021). In April 2020, S&P downgraded our bond rating to BB-, which had the effect of increasing the interest rate on the 2025 Notes to 6.45% in July 2020. The first coupon payment to the bondholders at the higher interest rate was January 2021. Any further upgrades or downgrades in our public debt ratings by Moody’s or S&P could decrease or increase our cost of funds, respectively.

Cash Flows

Cash Flow from Operations

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

•Net cash provided by operating activities decreased 45% or $436 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a $574 million decrease resulting from lower commodity prices, a $146 million decreased impact of working capital, an $85 million increase in operating costs and a $29 million increase in interest expense. The decreases were partially offset by a $216 million increase associated with increased production and a $182 million increase in our settled derivatives.

•Net cash generated from operating activities, net of changes in working capital, provided 67% of our cash requirements for capital investments for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to providing 79% of our cash requirements for capital investments for the same period in 2019. 

Cash Flow from Investing Activities

•Total E&P capital investing decreased $239 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, due to a $197 million decrease in direct E&P capital investing, a $21 million decrease in capitalized internal costs and a $21 million decrease in capitalized interest. 

•The decrease in capitalized interest for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the evaluation of natural gas and oil properties over the past twelve months.

(1)Includes $9 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to our water infrastructure project.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Actual capital expenditure levels may vary significantly from period to period due to many factors, including drilling results, natural gas, oil and NGL prices, industry conditions, the prices and availability of goods and services, and the extent to which properties are acquired or non-strategic assets are sold.

Cash Flow from Financing Activities

•Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $361 million, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $115 million for the same period in 2019. 

•In August 2020, we completed debt and equity offerings resulting in $345 million and $152 million in net proceeds, respectively.

•In November 2020, we paid $522 million to retire the Montage senior notes, and repaid the outstanding balance of $200 million related to Montage’s revolving credit facility.

•In 2020, we repurchased $107 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes at a discount for $72 million and recognized a $35 million gain on the extinguishment of debt. 

•In 2019, we paid $54 million on the open market to repurchase $62 million of our outstanding senior notes at a discount. We recognized a gain on early extinguishment of debt of $8 million.

•In December 2019, we retired the remaining $52 million principal of our 4.05% Senior Notes due January 2020.

•In January 2019, we repurchased approximately 5 million shares of common stock for approximately $21 million.

We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional discussion of our outstanding debt and credit facility and to Note 1 for additional discussion of our equity offering.

Working Capital

•We had negative working capital of $341 million at December 31, 2020, a $172 million decrease from December 31, 2019, as an $8 million increase in cash and cash equivalents was more than offset by a $70 million increase in various payables and a $157 million net reduction in the current mark-to-market value of our derivative position related to improved forward strip pricing across all commodities as compared to December 2019. Additionally, other current liabilities at December 31, 2020 decreased $34 million, compared to December 31, 2019, as a $43 million decrease in our accrued firm transportation liability related to the Fayetteville Shale sale was only partially offset by a prepayment that we received for an unrelated firm transportation assumption. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our anticipated cash flow from operations and our available credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operational spending requirements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to material off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2020, our material off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating service arrangements, $233 million in letters of credit outstanding against our 2018 revolving credit facility and $221 million in outstanding surety bonds. There are no other transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of our capital resources. For more information regarding off-balance sheet arrangements, we refer you to “Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments” below for more information on our operating leases.

Contractual Obligations and Contingent Liabilities and Commitments

We have various contractual obligations in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020, were as follows:

Contractual Obligations:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

(1)As of December 31, 2020, we had commitments for demand and similar charges under firm transportation and gathering agreements to guarantee access capacity on natural gas and liquids pipelines and gathering systems. Of the total $8.5 billion, $531 million related to access capacity on future pipeline and gathering infrastructure projects that still require the granting of regulatory approvals and/or additional construction efforts. For further information, we refer you to “Operational Commitments and Contingencies” in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. This amount also included guarantee obligations of up to $923 million.

With the close of the Montage Merger we acquired firm transportation commitments of approximately $1,100 million. These commitments approximate $99 million within the next year, $197 million from 1 to 3 years, $196 million from 3 to 5 years, $284 million from 5 to 8 years and $324 million beyond 8 years.

In the first quarter of 2019, we agreed to purchase firm transportation with pipelines in the Appalachian basin starting in 2021 and running through 2032 totaling $357 million in total contractual commitments of which the seller has agreed to reimburse $133 million of these commitments.

(2)Interest payments on our senior notes were calculated utilizing the fixed rates associated with our fixed rate notes outstanding at December 31, 2020. Senior note interest rates were based on our credit ratings as of December 31, 2020.

(3)Operating leases include costs for compressors, drilling rigs, pressure pumping equipment, office space and other equipment under non-cancelable operating leases expiring through 2036.

(4)As of December 31, 2020, our E&P segment had commitments of approximately $37 million for compression services associated primarily with our Southwest Appalachia division.

(5)Our other significant contractual obligations include approximately $12 million for various information technology support and data subscription agreements.

Future contributions to the pension and postretirement benefit plans are excluded from the table above. For further information regarding our pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we refer you to Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” below for additional information.

We refer you to Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a discussion of the terms of our debt. 

We are subject to various litigation, claims and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business, such as for alleged breaches of contract, miscalculation of royalties, employment matters, traffic incidents, pollution, contamination, encroachment on others’ property or nuisance. We accrue for such items when a liability is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that current litigation, claims and proceedings, individually or in aggregate and after taking into account insurance, are not likely to have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although it is possible that adverse outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for the period in which the effect of that outcome becomes reasonably estimable. Many of these matters are in early stages, so the

allegations and the damage theories have not been fully developed, and are all subject to inherent uncertainties; therefore, management’s view may change in the future.

We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Environmental and cleanup related costs of a non-capital nature are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount can be reasonably estimated. Management believes any future remediation or other compliance related costs will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

For further information, we refer you to “Litigation” and “Environmental Risk” in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.

Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information

As discussed in Note 9, in April 2018 the Company entered into the 2018 credit facility. Pursuant to requirements under the indentures governing our senior notes, each 100% owned subsidiary that became a guarantor of the 2018 credit facility also became a guarantor of each of our senior notes (the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The Guarantor Subsidiaries also granted liens and security interests to support their guarantees under the 2018 credit facility but not of the senior notes. These guarantees are full and unconditional and joint and several among the Guarantor Subsidiaries. Certain of our operating units which are accounted for on a consolidated basis do not guarantee the 2018 credit facility and senior notes.

Upon the November 2020 closing of the Merger with Montage, certain Montage entities owning oil and gas properties became guarantors to the 2018 credit facility.

The Company and the Guarantor Subsidiaries jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guarantee the payment of the principal and premium, if any, and interest on the senior notes when due, whether at stated maturity of the senior notes, by acceleration, by call for redemption or otherwise, together with interest on the overdue principal, if any, and interest on any overdue interest, to the extent lawful, and all other obligations of the Company to the holders of the senior notes.

SEC Regulation S-X Rule 13-01 requires the presentation of “Summarized Financial Information” to replace the “Condensed Consolidating Financial Information” required under Rule 3-10. Rule 13-01 allows the omission of Summarized Financial Information if assets, liabilities and results of operations of the Guarantors are not materially different than the corresponding amounts presented in the consolidated financial statements of the Company. The Parent and Guarantor Subsidiaries comprise the material operations of the Company. Therefore, the Company concluded that the presentation of the Summarized Financial Information is not required as the Summarized Financial Information of the Company’s Guarantors is not materially different from our consolidated financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

The discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

Natural Gas and Oil Properties

We utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration, development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties. Under this method, all such costs (productive and nonproductive), including salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities, are capitalized on a country-by-country basis and amortized over the estimated lives of the properties using the units-of-production method. These capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such pooled costs, net of applicable deferred taxes, to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves discounted at 10% (standardized measure) plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties. Any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non-cash expense. The expense may not be reversed in future periods, even though higher natural gas, oil and NGL prices may subsequently increase the ceiling. Companies using the full cost method are required to use the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months, including the impact of derivatives designated for hedge accounting, to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves.

64

Table of Contents  

Index to Financial Statements

Costs associated with unevaluated properties are excluded from our amortization base until we have evaluated the properties or impairment is indicated. The costs associated with unevaluated leasehold acreage and related seismic data, wells currently drilling and related capitalized interest are initially excluded from our amortization base. Leasehold costs are either transferred to our amortization base with the costs of drilling a well on the lease or are assessed at least annually for possible impairment or reduction in value. Our decision to withhold costs from amortization and the timing of the transfer of those costs into the amortization base involves judgment and may be subject to changes over time based on several factors, including our drilling plans, availability of capital, project economics and drilling results from adjacent acreage. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $1,472 million of costs excluded from our amortization base, all of which related to our properties in the United States. Inclusion of some or all of these costs in our properties in the United States in the future, without adding any associated reserves, could result in non-cash ceiling test impairments.

At December 31, 2020, the ceiling value of our reserves was calculated based upon the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $1.98 per MMBtu, for West Texas Intermediate oil of $39.57 per barrel and NGLs of $10.27 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials. The net book value of our natural gas and oil properties exceeded the ceiling amount in each quarter of 2020 resulting in total non-cash full cost ceiling test write-downs of $2,825 million. We had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2020. Future decreases in market prices, as well as changes in production rates, levels of reserves, evaluation costs excluded from amortization, future development costs and production costs may result in further non-cash impairments to our natural gas and oil properties.

No impairment expense was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020 in relation to our recently acquired Montage natural gas and oil properties. These properties were recorded at fair value as of November 13, 2020, in accordance with ASC 820 Fair Value Measurement. Pursuant to SEC guidance, we determined that the fair value of the properties acquired at the closing of the Merger clearly exceeded the related full-cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt and received a waiver from the SEC to exclude the properties acquired in the Merger from the ceiling test calculation. This waiver was granted for all reporting periods through and including the quarter ending September 30, 2021 as long as we can continue to demonstrate that the fair value of properties acquired clearly exceeds the full cost ceiling limitation beyond a reasonable doubt in each reporting period. As part of the waiver received from the SEC, we are required to disclose what the full cost ceiling test impairment amounts for all periods presented in each applicable quarterly and annual filing would have been if the waiver had not been granted. The fair value of the properties acquired in the Merger was based on forward strip natural gas and oil pricing existing at the date of the Merger, and we affirmed that there has not been a material decline to the fair value of these acquired assets since the Merger. The properties acquired in the Merger have an unamortized cost at December 31, 2020 of $1,087 million. Had we not received the waiver from the SEC, the impairment charge recorded would have been an additional $539 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Using the average quoted price from the first day of each month from the previous 12 months for Henry Hub natural gas of $2.58 per MMBtu, West Texas Intermediate oil of $55.69 per barrel and NGLs of $11.58 per barrel, adjusted for market differentials, the net book value of our United States natural gas and oil properties did not exceed the ceiling amount and did not result in a ceiling test impairment at December 31, 2019. We had no derivative positions that were designated for hedge accounting as of December 31, 2019.

Changes in natural gas, oil and NGL prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves. Our reserve base as of December 31, 2020 was approximately 76% natural gas, 3% NGLs and 21% oil, and our standardized measure and reserve quantities as of December 31, 2020, were $1.85 billion and 12.0 Tcfe, respectively.

Proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are a major component of the full cost ceiling test. Natural gas, oil and NGL reserves cannot be measured exactly. Our estimate of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and projections of costs that will be incurred in developing and producing reserves and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures. Our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management. Reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team for that property. The reservoir engineering and financial data included in these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers, who are not part of the asset management teams, and by our Director of Reserves, who is the technical person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our reserves estimates. Our Director of Reserves has more than 26 years of experience in petroleum engineering, including the estimation of natural gas and oil reserves, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to joining us in 2018, our Director of Reserves served in various reservoir engineering roles for EP Energy Company, El Paso Corporation, Cabot Oil & Gas Corporation, Schlumberger and H.J. Gruy & Associates, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He reports to our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, who has more than 32 years of experience in petroleum engineering including the estimation of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves in multiple basins in the United States, and holds a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering. Prior to

joining Southwestern in 2017, our Chief Operating Officer served in various engineering and leadership roles for EP Energy Corporation, El Paso Corporation, ARCO Oil and Gas Company, Burlington Resources and Peoples Energy Production, and is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

We engage NSAI, a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and government agencies, to independently audit our proved reserves estimates as discussed in more detail below. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-002699. Within NSAI, the two technical persons primarily responsible for auditing our proved reserves estimates (1) have over 23 years and over 19 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and petroleum engineering, respectively; (2) have over 12 years and over 19 years of experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves, respectively; (3) each has a college degree; (4) each is a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas or a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas; (5) each meets or exceeds the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; and (6) each is proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines. The financial data included in the reserve estimates is also separately reviewed by our accounting staff. Our proved reserves estimates, as internally reviewed and audited by NSAI, are submitted for review and approval to our President and Chief Executive Officer. Finally, upon his approval, NSAI reports the results of its reserve audit to the Board of Directors, with whom final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests. A copy of NSAI’s report has been filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report. 

Proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process, when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non-producing reserves, as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties. Proved developed reserves accounted for 68% of our total reserve base as of December 31, 2020. Assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates. The uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of future production volumes and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves. We cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures as many factors are beyond our control. We refer you to “Our proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are estimates that include uncertainties. Any material changes to these uncertainties or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated” in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” of Part I of this Annual Report for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties, risks and other factors.

In conducting its audit, the engineers and geologists of NSAI study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates. NSAI’s audit consists primarily of substantive testing, which includes a detailed review of major properties that account for approximately 97% of the present worth of the company’s total proved reserves. NSAI’s audit process consists of sorting all fields by descending present value order and selecting the fields from highest value to descending value until the selected fields account for more than 80% of the present worth of our reserves. The fields included in approximately the top 99% present value as of December 31, 2020, accounted for approximately 99% of our total proved reserves and approximately 100% of our proved undeveloped reserves. In the conduct of its audit, NSAI did not independently verify the data we provided to them with respect to ownership interests, natural gas, oil and NGL production, well test data, historical costs of operation and development, product prices, or any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. NSAI has advised us that if, in the course of its audit, something came to its attention that brought into question the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, NSAI did not rely on such information or data until it had satisfactorily resolved any questions relating thereto or had independently verified such information or data. On February 9, 2021, NSAI issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates for the year-ended December 31, 2020 stating that our estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves are, in the aggregate, reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Business Combinations

We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Accordingly, we recognize amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed equal to their estimated acquisition date fair values. We make various assumptions in estimating the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. As fair value is a market-based measurement, it is determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use. The most significant assumptions relate to the estimated fair values of proved and unproved oil and natural gas properties. Fair value of proved natural gas and oil properties as of the acquisition date was based on estimated proved natural gas, oil and NGL reserves and related discounted net cash flows. Significant inputs to the valuation include estimates of future production volumes, future operating and development costs, future

commodity prices and a weighted average cost of capital rate. The market-based weighted average cost of capital rate is subjected to additional project-specific risking factors. In addition, when appropriate, we review comparable purchases and sales of natural gas and oil properties within the same regions, and use that data as a proxy for fair market value; for example, the amount a willing buyer and seller would enter into in exchange for such properties. Any excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Any excess of the estimated fair value of net assets acquired over the acquisition price is recorded in current earnings as a gain on bargain purchase. Deferred taxes are recorded for any differences between the assigned values and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. 

The Merger with Montage qualified as a business combination, and as such, we estimated the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the November 13, 2020 acquisition date. The fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Fair value measurements also utilize assumptions of market participants. We used a discounted cash flow model and made market assumptions as to future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of natural gas and oil reserves, expectations for timing and amount of future development and operating costs, projections of future rates of production, expected recovery rates and risk adjusted discount rates. These assumptions represent Level 3 inputs, as defined in Note 8 – Fair Value Measurements. We recorded the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Montage Merger at their estimated fair value of approximately $213 million, which we consider to be representative of the price paid by a typical market participant. This measurement resulted in no goodwill or bargain purchase being recognized.

Derivatives and Risk Management

We use fixed price swap agreements and options to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities and interest rates. Our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability. We actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties based on their credit ratings and credit default swap rates where applicable, and to date have not had any credit defaults associated with our transactions. In 2020 and 2019, we financially protected 83% and 69%, respectively, of our total production with derivatives. The primary risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for our production. However, the market price risk is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related transaction that is financially protected.

All derivatives are recognized in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability as measured at fair value other than transactions for which the normal purchase/normal sale exception is applied. Certain criteria must be satisfied for derivative financial instruments to be designated for hedge accounting. Accounting guidance for qualifying hedges allows an unsettled derivative’s unrealized gains and losses to be recorded in either earnings or as a component of other comprehensive income until settled. In the period of settlement, we recognize the gains and losses from these qualifying hedges in gas sales revenues. The ineffective portion of those fixed price swaps are recognized in earnings. Gains and losses on derivatives that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment, or that do not meet hedge accounting requirements, are recorded as a component of gain (loss) on derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, the gain (loss) on derivatives component of the statement of operations reflects the gains and losses on both settled and unsettled derivatives. We calculate gains and losses on settled derivatives as the summation of gains and losses on positions which have settled within the reporting period.

As of December 31, 2020, none of our derivative contracts were designated for hedge accounting treatment. Changes in the fair value of unsettled derivatives that were not designated for hedge accounting treatment are recorded in gain (loss) on derivatives. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for more information on our derivative position at December 31, 2020.

Future market price volatility could create significant changes to the derivative positions recorded in our consolidated financial statements. We refer you to “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” in Item 7A of Part II of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our hedging activities.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

We record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost, as well as our periodic benefit cost, for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation (see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans). Two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate, which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and the expected return on plan assets, which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested. For the December 31, 2020 benefit obligation the initial discount rate assumed is 3.10%. This compares to an initial discount rate of 3.70% for the benefit obligation and periodic benefit cost recorded in 2020. As part of ongoing effort to reduce costs, we have elected to freeze our pension plan effective January 1, 2021. Employees that were participants in the

pension plan prior to January 1, 2021 will continue to receive the interest component of the plan but will no longer receive the service component. For the 2021 periodic benefit cost, the expected return assumed was reduced from 6.50% to 5.10%.

Using the assumed rates discussed above, we recorded total benefit cost of $9 million in 2020 related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Due to the significance of the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return, the following sensitivity analysis demonstrates the effect that a 0.5% change in those assumptions would have had on our 2020 pension expense:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of December 31, 2020, we recognized a liability of $46 million, compared to $43 million at December 31, 2019, related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans. During 2020, we made cash contributions totaling $13 million to fund our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

Long-term Incentive Compensation

Our long-term incentive compensation plans consist of a combination of stock-based awards that derive their value directly or indirectly from our common stock price, and cash-based awards that are fixed in amount, but subject to meeting annual performance thresholds. In March 2020, we issued our first long-term fixed cash-based awards. 

We account for long-term incentive compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize an amount equal to the fair value of the stock-based awards and cash-based awards cost in either the consolidated statement of operations or capitalize the cost into natural gas and oil properties included in property and equipment. Costs are capitalized when they are directly related to the acquisition, exploration and development activities of our natural gas and oil properties. We use models to determine fair value of stock-based compensation, which requires significant judgment with respect to forfeitures, volatility and other factors. The performance cash awards granted in 2020 include a performance condition determined annually by the Company. If we, in our sole discretion, determine that the threshold was not met, the amount for that vesting period will not vest and will be cancelled.

Our stock-based compensation is classified as either an equity award or a liability award in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The fair value of an equity-classified award is determined at the grant date and is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting life of the award. The fair-value of a liability-classified award is determined on a quarterly basis through the final vesting date and is amortized based on the current fair value of the award and the percentage of vesting period incurred to date. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion and disclosures regarding our long-term incentive compensation.
