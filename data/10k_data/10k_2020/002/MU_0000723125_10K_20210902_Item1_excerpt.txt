PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Overview

Micron Technology, Inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries, is an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all. With a relentless focus on our customers, technology leadership, and manufacturing and operational excellence, Micron delivers a rich portfolio of high-performance DRAM, NAND, and NOR memory and storage products through our Micron® and Crucial® brands. Every day, the innovations that our people create fuel the data economy, enabling advances in artificial intelligence and 5G applications that unleash opportunities — from the data center to the intelligent edge and across the client and mobile user experience.

We manufacture our products at wholly-owned facilities and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. We make significant investments to develop proprietary product and process technology, which are implemented in our manufacturing facilities. Advancements in product and process technology generally increase the density per wafer and reduce manufacturing costs of each generation of product. We continue to introduce new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, including higher data transfer rates, advanced packaging solutions, lower power consumption, improved read/write reliability, and increased memory density. 

The introduction of 176-layer NAND and 1α (1-alpha) DRAM represent major technology breakthroughs for our company and the first time in our history that we have achieved industry leadership across these two flagship technologies. In 2021, we introduced our industry leading 1α memory node, the world’s most advanced memory node in high-volume production. This advancement has been realized across our standard compute DRAM and LPDRAM product lines. We are shipping these products in volume, and we have partnered with customers to provide value-added innovation, speed market adoption of our new solutions, and prepare the ecosystem for broad adoption of our offerings across markets. We also launched 176-layer NAND based solutions into the market in 2021. Our managed NAND and SSD products incorporate NAND, a controller, firmware, and in some cases, DRAM. An increasing portion of our SSDs incorporate proprietary controllers and firmware that we have developed. Development of advanced technologies enables us to diversify our product portfolio toward a richer mix of differentiated, high-value solutions and to target high-growth markets and specific customer requirements across data center, intelligent edge, client, and mobile environments.

We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets and to remain competitive we must continuously develop and implement new products and technologies and decrease manufacturing costs. Our success is largely dependent on obtaining returns on our research and development (“R&D”) investments, efficient utilization of our manufacturing infrastructure, development and integration of advanced product and process technologies, market acceptance of our diversified portfolio of semiconductor-based memory and storage solutions, and efficient capital spending.

Lehi, Utah Fab and 3D XPoint 

In the second quarter of 2021, we updated our portfolio strategy to further strengthen our focus on memory and storage innovations for the data center market. In connection therewith, we determined that there was insufficient market validation to justify the ongoing investments required to commercialize 3D XPoint at scale. Accordingly, we ceased development of 3D XPoint technology and engaged in discussions with potential buyers for the sale of our facility located in Lehi that was dedicated to 3D XPoint production. As a result, we classified the property, plant, and equipment as held for sale and ceased depreciating the assets. On June 30, 2021, we announced that we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our Lehi facility to TI for cash consideration of $900 million. The sale is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2022. Select tools and other equipment will be retained for redeployment to our other manufacturing sites or for resale to other buyers.

In the third quarter of 2021, we recognized a charge of $435 million included in restructure and asset impairments (and a tax benefit of $104 million included in income tax (provision) benefit) to write down the assets held for sale to

the expected consideration, net of estimated selling costs, to be realized from the sale of these assets and liabilities. In the second quarter of 2021, we also recognized a charge of $49 million to cost of goods sold to write down 3D XPoint inventory due to our decision to cease further development of this technology. Our 3D XPoint technology development and Lehi facility operations are primarily included in our CNBU segment results.

Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business

Events surrounding the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic initially resulted in a reduction in economic activity across the globe, and the timing and extent of the ongoing economic recovery remains uncertain. As a result, we have experienced volatility in the markets that our products are sold into, driven by the move to a stay-at-home economy and fluctuations in consumer and business spending, which has affected demand for certain of our products. The ultimate extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business depends on future developments, which are highly uncertain and very difficult to predict, including the effectiveness and utilization of vaccines for COVID-19 and its variants, the severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and the effectiveness of the actions to contain or limit their spread.

From the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we proactively implemented preventative protocols, which we continuously assess and update for changes in conditions and emerging trends. These preventative protocols are intended to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, distributors, and communities, and to ensure business continuity. Government restrictions or severe outbreaks can impact our operations at certain sites. While all our global manufacturing sites are currently operating with close to full staff and at normal capacity levels, our facilities could be required to temporarily curtail production levels or temporarily cease operations based on government mandates or our health and safety protocols. We may be required, or deem it to be in the best interest of our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, and stakeholders, to alter our business operations in order to maintain a healthy and safe environment. It is not clear what potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including effects on our customers, employees, or on our financial results. We are following government policies and recommendations designed to slow the spread of COVID-19 and remain committed to the health and safety of our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, distributors, and communities.

We continuously assess our efforts to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which have included the following:

•In locations experiencing continued community COVID-19 infections, we prohibit onsite visitors and are generally requiring team members to work from home where possible or practical. Where work from home is not possible, all on-site team members must complete health questionnaires, pass through thermal scanning equipment to ensure they do not have an elevated body temperature, and adhere to physical distancing requirements, mask protocols, and team member separation protocols. We have also enhanced our contact tracing, significantly decreased business travel, and where possible, made ventilation and other health and safety enhancements at our facilities, and provided COVID-19 testing and vaccinations for our team members. 

•Following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s recent approval of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, we mandated that all U.S. employees and, in addition, contractors that enter our U.S. buildings and certain other locations, be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, subject to disability and religious exemptions, by November 15, 2021. 

•We continue to work closely with our customer base to best match our supply to changing market conditions.

•We evaluate our supply chain and communicate with our suppliers to identify supply gaps and have taken steps to provide continuity, to the extent possible, though we expect that constraints within our supply chain for certain IC components may somewhat limit our bit shipments in the near term. In some cases, we have added alternative suppliers and increased our on-hand inventory of raw materials needed in our operations.

•We have added assembly and test capacity to provide redundant manufacturing capability through our network of captive operations and external partners.

•We have evaluated all our construction projects across our global manufacturing operations and enacted protocols to enhance the safety of our team members, suppliers, and contractors.

•We have developed strategies and implemented measures to respond to a variety of potential economic scenarios, such as limitations on new hiring and business travel and reductions of discretionary spending.

•We are working with government authorities in the jurisdictions where we operate and continuing to monitor our operations in an effort to ensure we follow government requirements, relevant regulations, industry 

4 | 2021 10-K

standards, and best practices to help safeguard our team members, while safely continuing operations at our sites across the globe.

We believe these actions are appropriate and prudent to safeguard our team members, contractors, suppliers, customers, and communities, while allowing us to safely continue operations. We cannot predict how the steps we, our team members, government entities, suppliers, or customers take in response to the COVID-19 pandemic will ultimately impact our business, outlook, or results of operations.

Marketing and Customers

We seek to build collaborative relationships with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. By engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address our customers’ changing needs. Collaborating with our customers on their design needs in changing end markets and meeting their timelines for qualifying new products, allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers.

Our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our Micron and Crucial brand names and through private labels. We market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices to support our worldwide customer base. Our products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors, and retailers. Our independent sales representatives obtain orders, subject to final acceptance by us, and we then make shipments against these orders directly to customers or through our distributors. Our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors’ products. We sell our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products.

Due to volatile industry conditions, our customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price purchase contracts. We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that pricing, quantity, and other terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment.

In each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total revenue was from our top ten customers. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see “Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations.”

Competitive Conditions

We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Intel; Kioxia Holdings Corporation (formerly Toshiba Memory Corporation); Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK hynix Inc.; and Western Digital Corporation. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand 

8 | 2021 10-K

downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. We and our competitors generally seek to improve yields, reduce die size in product designs, or increase production capacity, which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We, and some of our competitors, have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. Certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. For these products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factor. Some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers. 

Some governments may provide, or have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance China’s stated national policy objectives. In addition, the Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies. Some of our competitors may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies or may not be subject to certain regulations or restrictions to which we are subject, which may allow them access to certain sales opportunities from which we may be restricted. In addition, our customers may redirect their business to our competitors based on government policy, national preference, or other factors.

Manufacturing

We manufacture our products within our own facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the United States, Malaysia, and China, and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. Our DRAM, NAND, and NOR products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage our product and process technology and certain resources and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.

Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves numerous precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including the number of mask layers and fabrication steps), and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. As we continue to increase our production of high value products and solutions, manufacturing costs are increasingly affected by the costs of application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) controllers and other semiconductors, advanced and complex packaging configurations, and testing at progressively higher performance speeds and quality levels. We continuously enhance our production processes, increase bits per wafer, transition to higher density products, and utilize advanced testing and assembly processes.

Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield loss from contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, or contamination from airborne particles, among other factors. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects and improving process margin to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We continue 

 9

to heighten quality control as our product offerings expand into higher-end segments that require increasing performance targets.

Our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged form and as unpackaged bare die. Our packaged products include packaged die, memory modules, and system-level solutions, such as SSDs, managed NAND, and MCPs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain packaged die, memory modules, SSDs, and MCPs. We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.

In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions, which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products; the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products; and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.

Resources

Supply Chain, Materials, and Third-Party Service Providers

Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services. However, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards and, in some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single or sole source. Various factors could impact the availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. Shortages or increases in lead times have occurred in the past, are currently occurring with respect to some materials and components, and may occur from time to time in the future.

Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers, analog integrated circuits, and other components used in some of our products and with outsourced semiconductor foundries, assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. Although we have certain long-term contracts with some of our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our third-party suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific capacity and/or quantity, our suppliers may allocate capacity to their other customers and capacity and/or materials may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. Inflationary pressures and shortages may increase costs for materials, supplies, and services. Regardless of contract structure, large swings in demand may exceed our contracted supply and/or our suppliers’ capacity to meet those demand changes in the required timeframe resulting in a shortage of parts, materials, or capacity needed to manufacture our products.

Trade disputes or other political conditions, economic conditions, or public health issues, such as COVID-19, may limit our ability to obtain materials necessary to produce Micron products. Certain materials are primarily available in a limited number of countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals available primarily from China. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. If China were to restrict or stop exporting these materials, our suppliers’ ability to obtain such supply may be constrained and we may be unable to obtain sufficient quantities, or obtain supply in a timely manner, or at a commercially reasonable cost. Constrained supply of rare earth elements, minerals, and metals may restrict our ability to manufacture certain of our products and make it difficult or impossible to compete with other semiconductor memory manufacturers who are able to obtain sufficient quantities of these materials from China.

Patents and Licenses

As of September 2, 2021, we owned approximately 15,400 active U.S. patents and 7,300 active foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2041.

From time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. We have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis.

We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us.

Product design and development efforts include high-density DDR4, DDR5, LPDDR4, LPDDR5, High Bandwidth Memory, Compute Express Link (CXL) based products, and advanced graphics DRAM; 3D NAND (including TLC and QLC technologies); mobile and storage solutions (including firmware and controllers); managed NAND; SSDs; and other memory technologies and systems.

To compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected customer requirements for memory and storage products and solutions. Our process, design, firmware, controller, package, and system development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. Our primary R&D centers are located in Boise, Idaho; Singapore; Japan; Taiwan; Italy; China; India; Germany; and other sites in the United States.

R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development and pre-qualification wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, personnel costs, and the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, such as investments in EUV lithography equipment. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through internal reviews and tests for performance, functionality, and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.

Human Capital

We depend on a highly educated and experienced workforce to design, develop, and manufacture high-quality, cutting-edge memory and storage solutions. As of September 2, 2021, we had approximately 43,000 employees located in the following regions:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

As of September 2, 2021, 30% of our global workforce were women, compared to 29% as of September 3, 2020. 23% of our technical or engineering roles were held by women, as compared to 21% on September 3, 2020. Women comprised 15% of our senior leaders as of September 2, 2021, as compared to 13% as of September 3, 2020.

In 2021, we added one female director to our Board of Directors, resulting in a Board of Directors that is comprised of four men and four women as of September 2, 2021, compared to five men and three women as of September 3, 2020. In addition, as of September 2, 2021, based on self-identification, one member of our Board of Directors is Asian, one member is African-American, and six members are White. One member of our Board of Directors is a veteran of the U.S. military.

Talent Acquisition, Engagement, and Retention 

Finding and retaining the best and brightest people in an extremely competitive industry environment is a strategic imperative for our business. We have partnerships with colleges and universities worldwide and through this collaboration, we offer curricula and mentorship programs that reinforce awareness of and engagement with Micron among students and graduates. In addition, we use artificial intelligence to reduce or eliminate the potential for bias from resumes, allowing us to focus on individual merit over personal characteristics. 

Periodically, we invite all team members to participate in our internal engagement survey, which covers questions that measure and provide insight into leadership and inclusive behaviors. In April 2021, 88% of our team members participated in the survey. Management uses feedback from the survey to identify and implement continuous improvements to our culture and workplace practices.

Compensation and Benefits 

Our compensation programs are designed to support our team members’ financial and personal well-being by providing a valuable return for their contributions to the company. Our total compensation strategy includes base salary, annual bonuses, equity awards, a discounted stock purchase plan, and a comprehensive benefits package.

Diversity, Equality & Inclusion 

We have made powerful commitments in 2021 to hold ourselves even more accountable for progress towards diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI), by setting six global DEI commitments: 

•Increase representation of underrepresented groups

•Drive equitable pay and inclusive benefits 

•Strengthen our culture of inclusion

•Advocate for racial and LGBTQ+ equality

•Engage with minority-owned financial institutions for cash management

•Increase representation and spend with diverse suppliers

We have a regular review of pay globally, including base pay and stock awards, to drive compensation equitability. In 2021, we achieved comprehensive global pay equity for all employees in total compensation across base,

bonuses, and stock rewards. In addition, a portion of our company-wide annual bonus program is based on the achievement of DEI-related goals. 

Health, Safety, and Wellness

Proactive efforts to prevent occupational illnesses and injuries allow us to maintain a safe, healthy, and secure workplace. Each of our sites have health and safety committees, which are designed to promote overall operations and communications regarding safety and to help lead and implement secure and compliant work areas. Our safety program creates a unified corporate safety culture by establishing a formal training structure and common safety practices across our global facilities. 

In addition to our proactive efforts on safety, we have increased our focus on providing enhanced services to our team members including free mental health and counseling support, providing critical-incident stress management services and emotional support sessions, launching a work-from-home toolkit, and encouraging team members to earn incentives by participating in well-being challenges and measuring their personal progress.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we went well beyond local, state, and federal requirements. With COVID-19 vaccines now available, we have launched a task force to monitor vaccine availability for team members, provided on-site vaccinations where available, provided monetary incentives, and, for U.S. team members, required vaccinations to improve vaccination rates. See “Item 1. Business – Overview – Impact of COVID-19 on Our Business.”

We are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), a group of leading companies focused on promoting responsible working conditions, ethical business practices, and environmental stewardship throughout our global supply chain. We strive to adhere to both our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (available on our website) and the RBA code of conduct, which is a demonstration of our commitment to integrity and responsible practices.

Government Regulations

Our worldwide business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and our products are governed by a number of rules and regulations. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations are presently not material to our results of operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future government laws, including, but not limited to, our operations, products, global trade, business acquisitions, employee health and safety, and taxes could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, capital expenditures, or competitive position. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.

Environmental Compliance

We approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding use of raw materials, discharges, climate change and energy use, emissions, and wastes from our manufacturing processes and address the evolving expectations of our investors, customers, team members, and other stakeholders. Compliance with the law and other compliance obligations is considered a minimum environmental expectation at Micron. Our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance. As part of the ISO 14001 framework, we have established a global environmental policy and meet requirements in terms of environmental aspects evaluation and control, compliance obligations, commitment, training, communication, control of documented information, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, and management review. While we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions.

Trade Regulations

Sales of our memory and storage products, and the transfer of related technical information and know-how, including support, are subject to laws and regulations governing international trade, including, but not limited to, export control, customs, and sanctions regulations administered by U.S. government agencies such as the Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”) of the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Office of Foreign Asset Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Other jurisdictions, such as the European Union or China, also maintain, or may implement, similar laws and regulations with which we must comply. Any such laws or regulations may require that we either obtain licenses or other authorizations to export certain of our products or sell them to certain countries, companies, or individuals, or, in the absence of such licenses or authorizations, not export or sell the applicable products or transfer the related technical information and know-how to the affected countries, companies, or individuals. In addition, increased tariffs imposed by the countries in which our products are sold can increase the cost of our product to our customers. The laws and regulations that govern international trade change frequently, sometimes without advance notice. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Laws and Regulations – Trade regulations have restricted our ability to sell our products to several customers, could restrict our ability to sell our products to other customers or in certain markets, or could otherwise restrict our ability to conduct operations” and “ – Risks Related to Our Business, Operations, and Industry – We face geopolitical and other risks associated with our international sales and operations that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.”

We and/or our suppliers and service providers could be affected by tariffs, embargoes, or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, responsible sourcing practices, public health crises, contagious disease outbreaks, or other matters, which could limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost. Environmental regulations could limit our ability to procure or use certain chemicals or materials in our operations or products. In addition, disruptions in transportation lines could delay our receipt of materials. Lead times for the supply of materials have been extended in the past. Our ability to procure components to repair equipment essential for our manufacturing processes could also be negatively impacted by various restrictions or disruptions in supply chains, among other items. The disruption of our supply of materials, components, or services, or the extension of our lead times could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Similarly, if our customers experience disruptions to their supplies, materials, components, or services, or the extension of their lead times, they may reduce, cancel, or alter the timing of their purchases with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.
